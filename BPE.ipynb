              "'Technical committees will be attached to each ministry. An Administrative Panel will examine and advise the Cabinet Development Committee regarding all proposals having to do with terms of employment or administrative rules and regulations applicable to personnel engaged in Five –Year Plan operations, procedures or delegations of authority. A special committee will be appointed to advise on the coordination of foreign aid. In districts where development is more intensive, the Badahakims  will be assisted by District Development Officer and staffs of technical advisors appointed by executive agencies of the central Government. About three fourths of Nepal\\'s 15 crores per year imports from India consist of textiles, cigarettes, sugar, petrol, etc., on which products excise taxes within India average about 20 per cent. As indicated above, the entire Five-Year Plan as projected calls for an outlay of approximately 33 crore rupees. Full execution of the Plan would require in addition to the 22 crores just cited, about 11 crores, and this would come, necessarily, from external aid. In the light of experience in other countries, this rate if advance is believed to be realistic and attainable. The success of this programme will depend to a large degree, however, upon the availability of trained personnel: administrators. The principal crops are paddy, corn, wheat, oil seeds, sugar cane, tobacco, buckwheat, jute, fruits and vegetables. The benefits of this programme, while gradual in coming, can be far-reaching. For agricultural production in Nepal can ultimately be increased by at least 25 to 30 per cent through improved varieties and new crops alone. Plant and Animal Protection: entomology and plant pathology works are getting under way in Nepal for the purpose of controlling the more common and destructive insects attacking plants and parasites attacking animals. A laboratory is being established to identify the more common destructive insects and parasites and to help perfect practical, cheap methods of control. It is planned that an entomologist and pathologist with assistants will train and supervise field workers who will be organized into protection units for service on an expanding scale. (1) Milk collecting centres in Kathmandu Valley. Tributaries from the mountainous north join to form three main rivers cutting through valleys to the south the Kosi in the east the Gandaki in the central west and the Karnali in the west : these each carry a minimum discharge of nearly 10000cusecs. It is intended under the Five-Year Plan to recondition tow of the larger existing irrigation works (Jagdishpur and Judha) capable of watering about 9000 acres of paddy : to complete seven projects now under way with Indian and American aid which will when finished irrigate about 45000 acres ; and to undertake additional projects commanding some 200000 acres of arable land. Facilities for the training in Nepal of junior technical personnel including overseers, draughtsmen, surveyors, computers, accounts and clerical staffs will be expanded during the first years in order to meet as rapidly as possible the growing requirements for such personnel. (4) by ropeway. The ropeway is of the greatest economic importance as it is by far the cheapest means of bringing foodstuffs and essential goods into Kathmandu Valley with its population of over 600000. The ropeway has served the Valley very well indeed, and even now, working 12 hours per day, 60 tons of goods are brought in daily. Pokhara : Pokhara is the best of the fair weather strips but is undulating It can wait for three years for development into an all weather runway Some of the higher level personnel will probably receive periods of training in India under the Colombo Plan: the balance will be trained locally. B. Wireless Communications. Since the introduction of wireless communications about six years ago, thirty well distributed stations have been established. All except two in Kathmandu and Biratnagar, are powered by petrol engine generators. The number of lines is insufficient, however, and there is now a growing demand for the establishment of telephone exchanges in other cities especially Birganj and Biratnagar and for improvements and expansion of trunk lines which now total some 600 miles in length. To date however the total installed capacity of the country , concentrated in Kathmandu and Biratnagar, amounts to only a few hundred kilowatts. Subject to through going study and analysis before decisions are reached, priority consideration will be given to industries for the production of cement, forest products, sugar, textiles, cigarettes, and iron. For cottage industries, training-cum –production centers will be created in different parts of the country, at least one each year-to develop and improve designs, quality production, and skills. Fragmentary historical evidence indicates the past existence in Nepal of mining copper, iron and other minerals. But in the aeons of geological time the present Himalayas are believed to be of relatively late origin and the gradual upheavals that brought about their formation on the earth\\'s crust may have broken up or buried deep some previously existing deposits. The full facts are not known and cannot be known until extensive exploratory and investigative work has been done. There are several stages or aspects in the making of determinations as to the size and quality of mineral deposits. This may be done by further drillings and by laboratory analysis of samples brought in for scientific testing. Other minerals known to exist in Nepal but without any knowledge as to whether the amounts are commercially promising are cobalt, lead and zinc. Each of these questions will be the subject of study and action under the Five-Year Plan. Co-ordination will be maintained between the Bureau of Mining and other departments including those of Transport, Communications, Industry, Agriculture, Village Development, Education, Power and , of course, Planning and development. A special board will be set up, according to present plans, to make loans to prospectors and mining ventures, conducted under technical supervision of the Bureau of Mines. Within the Bureau will be established services of geology, ore dressing, minerals analysis and metallurgy. Ridges stretching southward from Himalayan highlands to the lowlands of the Terai have interposed lofty deterrants to east-west trade within the country, an effect reinforced by un-bridged rivers flowing southward into India. Rugged terrain throughout the greater part of the country has been a sever obstacle to even north-south commerce, internal and external. But the trade channedl that have exited - within the country and through a few high passes into the Tibet region of China, and across the flat 500 mile Indian frontier - are largely north to south channels. Until recent years goods north of the Terai were carried almost exclusively by men and by pack animals along narrow and sometimes dangerous mountain trails. Being the immediate source for Tibet of rice, sugar, tea, amber, turquoise, coral, brocades and many other items, Nepal was called by Tibetans Bhayul, the \"land of plenty\". These developments might have presaged a rapid upsurge in trade with India and , through India, with overseas countries. They did make for a considerable increase in the imports of Kathmandu valley. The recent inauguration of air transport, serviced by the Indian Airlines Corporation, which links Kathmandu with India, on the one hand, and with a few interior centers on the on the other, has facilitated a dispersal of imports from India and beyond. We have not had public and private commercial and banking institutions well adapted tot the promotion and support of trade. During the past several years financial instability has reduced willingness to initiate or expand trade ventures. Ad foreign trade relations - with India, China, and many other nations with whom Nepal has diplomatic relations have not had the desirable foundation of a series of well-drawn treaties of commerce and friendship. Such a treaty with China, together with an improvement in transport facilities to the Tibetan border, would be a means to the restoration of our entrepot trade which could bean important aspect of our future commerce. But the most urgently needed negotiations is for a revision of our present treaty with India which affects both the bulk of our foreign trade, which is with India, and potentially significant overseas trade which must pass through India. The current treaty is now out-dated in its provisions relating to import and export tariffs, customs administration, the movements of goods in transit, and the administration of foreign exchange earnings. Until our educational facilities in this field can be built up, selected advanced students will be sent abroad for training in the fields of our greatest need. By these and other means effort will be made to enable commerce to play its important part in broadening the country\\'s economic base and in raising the standard of living of all segments of the population. Grassland is also available for cattle breeding. The surrounding forest, large and dense, abounds in high class timber resources for wood-working and derivative industries such as the manufacture of furniture, matches, paper, tanning materials and bamboo products. Ample raw materials also exist for other small or medium-size industries such as oil-milling, rice-milling cigarette production and lime and cement manufacture. Repeated attempts in the past to cultivate the valley\\'s rich waste-land were thwarted by the deadly form of malaria which it is now possible, by modern methods, to control or eradicate. The conquest of malaria is the first major step toward the valley\\'s development. The second is the building of roads and bridges. Concurrently, studies and surveys are needed to establish the potentialities of the area and its primary needs. The project will also help to preserve various forms of wild life. And, in time, it should bring to the Government revenues which can be applied further development in the country. Development of the area has already begun with preliminary surveys and the initiation of malaria control work, road building and other activities. Plans have been drawn for a wide variety of developmental activities - such as construction of a 50 mile road from Hitaura to Narayangarh, spraying of 400 villages against malaria, settlement of 25,000 people, breaking and putting into cultivation 50,000 bighas of land, establishing co-operative societies, schools and health services, setting up a variety of local industries, co-operating with the Village Development administration in building up local activities and extension services, building an air strip, and carrying out a cadastral survey. Steps are being taken to integrate the activities of National Government Departments in relation to this first multi-purpose field project undertaken in Nepal. This kind of integration is a new feature in our administration. the interested departments - especially Transport and Communications, Health, Irrigation, Industry, Agriculture, Forestry, Education, and Finance as well as Planning and Development are to take active part in the Project. Panchayats or village councils will be organized and the development work accomplished will in large part be the product of the efforts of the local people. There are only about 50 qualified medical officers attached to the different hospitals, and only one doctor for every 17 lakhs (170,000) people. There are no health statistics available for the country, yet life expectancy is known to be low and maternal and child mortality to be high. Intestinal parasites, filaria, tuberculosis, venereal diseases and malaria are common, the last-named affecting about 30% of the two -thirds of the population living in malarious areas. A reorganization of Health Services to simplify administration increase and render more efficient the staff, and to improve co-ordination with Health aid programmes of other countries is urgently needed. The Health Department proposes through the Five – Year Plan to establish a smooth running machinery for conducting the recognized functions of Health Services. It will do its utmost to promote health for all by providing: Treatment of disease through improvement of hospitals and dispensaries, and an increase in their number and distribution. Under the Five-Year Plan, work by the Local Health Services will become the responsibility of the Medical Officer through Health specialists, health assistants and female auxiliary health workers, public health nurses, and district health officers. The malarial control programme will continue under the Insect Borne Disease Control Bureau. An additional 423 beds (42 Ayurvedic) and 51 dispensaries will be added to present facilities. The dispensaries will gradually be converted into Health Centres, as the health assistants, now being trained, become available. A total of 276 nurses and 205 health assistants will be required to fulfil the plan of the programme as outlined below. These, as well as other personnel required for staffing hospitals, etc. will have to be recruited on a tempo0rary basis from outside the country until enough can be trained locally. Building of 51 dispensaries in the five years, 34 of which will be started the first year. Conversion of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur hospitals into 25 bed institutions with increases in staffs. Control of malaria through yearly spraying of all homes in malarious area, and by distributing anti-malarial drugs to the people: 425 lakhs of people will be thus protected. 8. Repair and improvement of existing hospitals and dispensaries with additional staff and equipment. Health Assistants School to be housed near the reorganized Bir Hospital permanently, graduation fifty students every year. Ayurvedic hospital to be enlarged to a 50 bed hospital, and three Ayurvedic 15 bed hospitals and 43 dispensaries to be built. Homeopathic Hospital building to be built and two dispensaries for each Zone to be constructed. Aid to other existing institution, such as “Paropakar” society, the Tuberculosis Association, and “Swasthya Mandir” (Dhunkuta). Making smallpox vaccination compulsory. Requiring declaration of notifiable diseases. Enforcement of international regulations relative to health certification of persons entering or leaving the country. In the area of elementary education, plans are already functioning. Teachers are being trained art the approximate rate of 400 per year; new schools are continually being opened by these new teachers: adult education has its ground work established in that each new teacher is prepared to organize and teach adult literacy classes. The National Teachers Training Centre, plus the proposed School of Education and the Sub-teacher training centres can train approximately 600 teachers per year. 1. Tri- Chandra College (Arts and Science) 3. Women’s College (Arts) Nepal National College (Night School) 2. Training a small nucleus of administrative officers to administer existing institutions under the control body by bringing them together in a unified University Organization administrative officers. Practically no added internal cost is involved in these first two steps. The third step is to organize immediately a professional School of Education with the existing National Teacher Training Centre as a nucleus, expanding it into a four year School of Education for the training of elementary and secondary school teachers. Such a professional School of Agriculture should gradually incorporate an agricultural experiment station with suitable branch stations and the necessary research and service laboratories for soil and seed testing, animal diagnostic services, etc. 5. A further step under current study is the advancement to university level of the School of Engineering discussed in the following chapter on training. Such a school might well continue to offer short courses for technicians and supervisors needed by Nepal in its developmental programme. The school will provide a degree-granting curriculum, with a common base for two years and in the last tow years, specialization in mechanical, electrical, civil, and industrial engineering and in mining. In this school necessary non-duplicating laboratories would serve and help to integrate the work of materials testing laboratories, metallurgical laboratories, hydraulic laboratories and the like. Ultimately the University should embrace a Medical School including nursing education and finally dentistry. While immediate steps can be taken to bring together the existing colleges and the organization of added professional schools such as education and agriculture, the development of the Engineering School and Medical School will require several years in order to provide the necessary facilities and trained faculty members. The Government is now spending approximately 41/2 lakhs of rupees annually to operate existing colleges. It is estimated that for an additional expenditure of approximately 12 lakhs of rupees for the Five-Year Plan period a significant beginning toward a Comprehensive University Programme could be inaugurated.School of Education and a Universities are not built in a day or a year. Unless this problem is met with determination and vigor, there can be no possibility of success in attaining the goals of the Five- Year Plan. Training more than any other single factor will determine the rate at which plans can be translated into action. It is estimated that an average of at least 5 percent of each departmental budget over the five-year period will be spent for training, and that the percentage during the first two years will be much higher. Thus total expenditures for training will not be less than Rs 1.66 cores (16.6 million) and the outlay required during the first year may be in the vicinity of Rs80 lakhs (8 millions). Preliminary plans are being laid for the establishment, later, of a medical school as part of the new National University. Mention has been made of plans, during the coming months, to conduct, with expert help, studies of the extent and quality of our resources---human and material, the present level of our national production and income, the fundamental features and current functioning of our economic institutions as well as the institutional evolution now needed in order to promote more effectively our own economic growth, and the ways in which both internal and aid resources may be employed most effectively in the interest of healthy economic advancement for the entire nation. Reference has also been made to more detailed survey specifically related to development activities being planned in nearly all parts of the agricultural programme, and to projected work in the fields of forestry, irrigation, power, road building ropeway construction, communications, industry, mining and resettlement. Present Economic Conditions Historical Background The history of planned process of economic development in Nepal is short. Before 1951, some development activities were undertaken but their scope was very limited. Among them were limited programmes to develop power and drinking water facilities in Kathmandu, health programmes in a few districts, some schools, and a college, a commercial bank, a few roads and some small-scale irrigation works. However, the economic stimulus of World War II led to the establishment of the first modern industrial units Nepal. Many of these failed to survive the immediate post-war period because of poor management and lack of technical knowledge. Only very recently attention has been given to feasibility studies and the other prerequisites of sound industrial development. Even after the political changes of 1951-52 relatively little progress was made. The difficulties of changing the political and administrative structure were largely responsible. First Five Year Plan (First Plan) Serious efforts to plan economic development took place after the establishment of a Planning Board in 1955. The First Five Year Plan, prepared by the Board, covered the 1956-61 periods. Because of the Bird’s limited knowledge and experience, there were serious shortcomings in the Plan itself. Despite this, some significant results were achieved, although expenditures were only Rs 210 millions or Rs 42 millions annually. Little progress occurred in road, power, and industrial development. But the Plan did stimulate public interest in, and support of planning. Government was made aware of the requirement for planned development. There was significant progress in the fields of education and health. Overall, however, the plan made little4 headway creating the necessary base for economic development. The Three Year Plan (Second Plan) A significant result of the First Plan was the recognition of the conditions required for successful planning and project implementation. It was realized that a plan formulated without detailed knowledge of actual conditions and the development potential of the several was of limited usefulness. A plan must, moreover, take full account of administrative relationships and the limited financial and other resources available. At the time the Second Plan was prepared, knowledge of economic conditions in Nepal was still extremely limited. In the absence of survey and studies of natural recourses, agricultural output national income and other economic variables, existing economic conditions could not be accurately ascertained. It was not possible, therefore, to set overall targets and goals in quantitative terms. The absence in data also prevented the formulation of a long range perspective planning within which the Second Plan was to operate. Recognizing these limitations, Second Plan Sectoral targets were fixed in terms of Nepal’s ability to finance and imp lement the development programme. Because of the existing shortcomings, the Second Plan gave priority to activities which would the base for more comprehensive future plans. Emphasis was given to the collection of data on economic conditions organizational reform and improvement, and the development of the economic infrastructure. Priority was given to survey and statistical activities agricultural reform, organizational improvement and training. In the industrial sector, emphasis was placed on the completion of projects already underway. For social services, efforts were directed more at the improvement than the expansion of schools and health centre. For the implementation of the programmes under the above mentioned priority scale, an outlay of Rs 600 million was programmed. An additional Rs 70 million was to be made available as loans to the private sector for investment in agriculture and industry. Three Year Plan Progress During the Second Plan, the progress made was significant from the point of view of rapid economic development. The planned outlay in the public sector was virtually achieved. Table 1 gives the financial allocations and actual expenditures during the Second Plan. Out of the Rs 70 million allocated to the private sector, Rs 25 millions were al resettlement and industrial development loans. Substantial sums were also allotted to industry, roads and irrigation. These allocations are commensurate to with the priorities established in the original plan. 1\\tIncludes Co -operatives 2\\tThis covers only hydrological survey. Other surveys are included in departmental totals for the several sections. 3\\tAccountant training and engineering college expenditures are included. 4\\tIncludes railway and ropeway. 6\\tIncluded in irrigation expenditures. 7\\tIncludes building, planning, revolving, contingency, and other expenditures. Table 1, appears to indicate a considerable shortfall in expenditures for survey and training. This is misleading since expenditures on these activities, although separately shown in the target figures, are included in the departmental totals of realized magnitudes. Expenditures incurred for the forest resources and botanical surveys, mineral exploration, surveys of irrigation and power potential and in the transport sector are in the respective departmental totals. The same goes for training expenditures in such fields as agriculture, cooperatives, cadastral survey and the like. Even in terms of physical objectives the Plan targets have, on the whole, been achieved. The population census, sample agricultural survey, a national income estimate and other statistical and survey activities have provided greater knowledge about the economy. Development budget expenditures increase annually over the Second Plan period and represents, in monetary terms, improvements made in administrative efficiency and th4e absorptive capacity of Nepal. In 1962- 63, the first year of the plan, Rs 70 million were spent. In the second year, development budget expenditures rose to Rs 147 million, In the final year expenditures were Rs 180 million, excluding projects supported by Indian Aid, which were added in th4 supplementary budget. In addition to administrative reform, land reforms were started during the Second Plan. Their purpose is to modernize agriculture and provide incentives for increasing production. Significant progress has been achieved in industry, transport and power. The present position of the several sectors of the economy is given in the following sections: Agriculture Nepal’s agricultural output depends very heavily on climatic conditions. During 1963-64, the second year of the Second Plan, whether conditions adversely affected agricultural output. In the first and third years, weather conditions were normal and did not adversely affect production. It is estimated, however, that agricultural output increased over the plan period as a whole as a result of programmes undertaken His Majesty’s Government. The expansion of existing units and the establishment of new factories have encouraged cash crop production with a resultant increase in output. Although still far from adequate, the agricultural extension services have has positive effects. These include improved seed, implements, fertilizers and plant protection facilities. Irrigation has also been provided on an additional 100,000 areas. Institutional improvements have also been made. The Agricultural Reorganization and the Cooperative Bank Acts of 1962 were steps in this direction. The Agricultural Reorganization Act was implemented in selected gram panchyats of Jhapa, Palpa and Chitwan dis tricts. Under the Land Reform Act of 1964, efforts are being made to extend the programme to the whole country. The results to date are encouraging. The programme involving cadastral survey, identifications of the tillers and collection of savings has been virtually completed in seven districts. All phases except the cadastral survey have also been undertaken in another nine districts. This programme is designed to give greater incentive to the4 cultivator to expand output. Table 2; give production estimates of selected crops for the years 1961-62 and 1964-65. The data are secured from the Agricultural Census and the Department of Agriculture Industry Significant progress in the industrial sector has been achieved during the Three Year Plan. With the establishment of new units and the modernization and expansion of existing plants, industrial output in selected sectors has increased significantly as shown in Table 3(A). 3 Table 3(A), does not give a full picture of recent industrial development. As a result of the increased attention given by Government and of the assistance provided by the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, a variety of new production units have been established. Among these are plants manufacturing cotton and woolen textiles, iron products, and utensils. Transport and Communication Transport and communication difficulties have been major obstacles to the rapid economic development of Nepal. Although progress was made during the Second Plan, further expansion is essential to bring modern transport facilities to most areas of Nepal. The Raxaul-Bhainse and the Kathmandu-Kodari roads have been major road construction programmes. Work was started East-West Highway and the Sunauli-Pokhara road. In the aviation sector, the Gaucher cross runway will be finished in the first year of the Third Plan. Improvement work is also underway on other airports. In telecommunications, seen areas control stations and 50 satellite stations have been established. A new radio link was initiated between New Delhi and Kathmandu. In addition to increasing internal postal service, international parcel and insurance services were also started. Power Work on power development has moved slower than planned but, in the light of the difficulties faced, quite satisfactorily. Difficulties in transporting machinery and equipment and periodic labour shortages have delayed work. By the end of 1965, 7,600 k. w., of new generation facilities will be operative. This includes 3,000 at Trisuli, 2,400 k. w. at Panauti, 10,000 k. w. will become available in 1966 from Trisuli and Hetauda. Education There has been considerable progress in the field of education. There were 13 colleges, 85 high schools, 300 secondary and 1,200 primary schools at the beginning of the First Plan. During the First Plan, the number of primary schools rose to over 4,000 and enrollment increased to nearly 200,000. The number of secondary schools rose to 500. Colleges increased to 31 in number and the only university in Nepal was established. Teacher training and adult education programmes were started. During the Second Plan, emphasis was placed upon improving rather than expanding education facilities. The number of primary students increased from 1990,000 to 346,000. The proportion of school age children receiving primary education rose from 15.3 per cent to 27 percent. Secondary schools increased from 500 to 660 and the number of secondary schools students was approximately 40,000 by the end of the Plan. The adult education students have been enrolled to date. The Population Census of 1952— 54 revealed a 4.4 percent literary rate in Nepal. The Census of 1961-62 showed an increase in the literary rate to 8.9 percent. There has undoubtedly been a further rise since that time. Health Health facilities in Nepal fall below the standards of most countries in the world. Considerable progress has, however, been made. At present 42 government hospitals with some 1,000 beds available. In addition, health centres and health posts have been established in the villages to provide facilities for as many people as possible. Malaria eradication work has been completed the central zone of Nepal in which 2, 400,000 persons reside. Eradication work is underway in the eastern zone covering 1,300,000 persons. Smallpox and leprosy control programmes has been started. The maternity and child care programme has been explained. Efforts have been made to improve sanitary conditions. International Resources In the last few years, there has been considerable progress in the mobilization of international resources. Only a few years ago, Nepal’s development budget was almost wholly dependent on foreign aid. During the First Plan, Nepal’s dependence on foreign assistance increased. In 1958 -29, 29 percent of the public sector development expenditures were internally financed. This ratio fell to six percent in 1960-61. In the Second Plan period, this trend was reversed. The Plan called for financing Rs 670 million of which 110 million or 17 percent of proposed expenditures were to be met by the internal resources. The actual contribution amounted to 24 percent of the total. Trade During the Second Plan, efforts were made to diversify trade. It is not possible to measure the success of these efforts since the required data for recent years are not yet available. In 1957-58, imports were recorded at Rs 160 million and by 1960-61 they had increased to Rs 400 million. In 1961-62, they further to Rs 440 million. Although the trade is still predominantly with India, trade with other countries is gradually increasing. Table 4 gives export-import data based on licenses issued by the Commerce Development for the 1961-64 periods. This covers only trade with oversea countries. The volume of tourist traffic of Nepal has been increasing steadily. In 1958, 2,756 tourists visited Nepal. By 1963, the number had increased to 7,750. During 1964 there was a further increase to 9,976. Further expansion is possible as airline and hotel facilities become more adequate. The earning from tourism is expected to rise rapidly in the future. Conclusion: The above facts indicate the achievements of the Second Plan. Although Nepal underwent a revolutionary political change in 1951, it has been only very recently that the tempo of economic activity has expanded significantly. The Nepalese economy in still in a very early stage of development. Gross domestic product in 1961-62 is estimated at Rs 3,680 million. For 1964-65, the value of output has been tentatively put at Rs 5,280 million. This gives an increase of 43 percent over the three year period of which reflects price rather than output increases. Accordingly, per capita income in estimated at Rs 570 ($68). This is below the per capita incomes of India, Pakistan and Ceylon which, in 1963, were estimated at $73, $74 and $ 137 respectively. In the United States, at the other extreme, per capita income is over $2,500. Ninety-three percent of the population of Nepal is dependent on agriculture which contributes 65 percent of gross domestic product. The industrial sector is just getting started and contributes a small fraction of total output. Its activities are confined mostly to processing agricultural products. Transport, communication and power facilities are inadequate to meet Nepal’s needs. The literacy rate is among the lowest in world and life expectancy at birth is 32 years. The low income level of Nepal indicates that savings arte also very small. This limits the volume of investments which can be financed internally and makes it even more imperative that the limited resources be used productively for the benefit of the nation. 9The export figures do not measure actual exports since raw jute, timber, leather and other products which did not have to pay an export tax were not recorded. In addition, taxable commodities were, to some extent, smuggled across the border and thus not recorded. The Central Bureau of Statistics estimates the exports of 1961-65 at Rs 4000.0 million instead of the recorded Rs 265 millions. These are licensing rather those actual values. Actual figures are undoubtedly smaller. CHAPTER II Objectives and Priorities As mentioned earlier, income levels are among the lowest in the world. The task facing the nation is to improve the economic condition of its citizens as rapidly as possible. Nepal must accomplish the task within a few decades what other nations have taken a much longer period to achieve. As His Majesty has stated, “if we want to raise Nepal to the level of other developed countries, we have to accomplish 10 or 20 years what they took centuries to do.” To achieve this accelerated development, available resources particularly human, must be fully and effectively utilized. To ensure full mobilization of these resources, Nepal has adopted the method of planned economic development. The social objectives of the Third Plan have their origin in the planning process begun in 1956, and are defined within the framework of the guidelines set forth in the Constitution of Nepal: 2. Towards the fulfillment of the objectives laid down in clause (1) such policy, in particular, shall be followed as a result of which- a. All citizens may have equal opportunity and facility to develop their personality and to make economic progress ; b. Citizens may have reasonable and adequate means of livelihood ; and c. \\tThe ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so regulated as may bring about equitable distribution of wealth and as may best sub serve the common good and also afford reasonable protection and encouragement to private enterprise in the allotted sectors of industry and trade. The above objectives are intended to promote the welfare of the people of Nepal in the process of economic development. To increase total output is not enough. It is also necessary to distribute the output equitably. The Panchayat System and National Development For rapid economic development the social and political structure must stimulated rather than hinder the growth process. As Nepal’s own experience since 1960 has shown, political stability is one necessary condi tion. In the social field, all citizens should have an opportunity to develop their capacities to the fullest extent and be able to secure gainful and productive employment. To accomplish the desired results, conscription for work and distinction based upon caste, religion and sex must be eliminated. Education, medical care employment opportunity must be made available to all. To achieve the goal of social justice, steps should be taken to eliminate gradually the concentration of wealth in a small group and to reduce the income gap between the few and the many. Care must be taken, however to ensure that adequate incentives for work and investment are also provided. To accomplish this, new organizations need to be established and operated under necessary rules and regulations. Political Stability, the elimination of socially undesirable systems, and changes in organizational structure are imperative for the success of any development plan. But these alone are not sufficient. There must also be a gradual evolution of the political, social and economic system in response to changing conditions to allow the necessary flexibility while adhering to the basic social objectives. Such a system must be close to the people and responsive to their needs. Its scope should not be restrictive but should cover all aspects of social and economic activities. The panchayat system is the medium through which the constitutional objectives are to be met. More specifically, the panchayat structure designed to create the institutional arrangements necessary for the political, social and economic growth of the nation. It will involve the people at all levels of administrative and executive action within the country. In view of the basic objectives, all important activities must be undertaken with in the framework of the panchyat system. His Majesty’s Government has committed itself to a decentralization policy which will further strength the zonal, district and village panchayats. The Preamble to the Constitution states-  Whereas it is desirable in the best interest and for the full development of the Kingdom of Nepal and of the Nepalese people to conduct the government of the country in consonance with the popular will, and originating from the very base with the active cooperation of the whole people’ it embodies the4 principles of decentralization. The panchayat system is not only a framework but also the means for the implementation of the development effort. The success of any nation-wide development plan depends upon the active support and cooperation of the people. The contribution of the panchayat system in mobilizing local resources and labour has also been important. The Long Run Perspective In the absence of a long term perspective, the targets of short range programme such as the five year plan are limited and possibly even conflicting. For example, in the five year plan, the various sectoral programmes must be coordinated. These programme are, a part of a continuing process reflecting past activities as well as future plans. Therefore, long term goals for each sector are essential. These are particularly necessary in such as power, transport and education. A long term target of doubting national income in fifteen years has been set. This may appear ambitious in terms of past achievements. The target appears feasible, however, on the basis of the experience of other developing nations. To achieve this, national income must increase at an annual rate of 4.7 percent. In view of the present level of utilization of available resources, such a rate of growth neither does nor appears feasible in the near future. The rate can, however, be expected to rise above it over the fifteen year period. The rate of population increase for the past few years in estimated at two per cent and is expected to remain at this during the Third Plan. It is estimated to rise to 2.2 per cent in the following five years and then to 2.4 per cent. Based upon the population projection, per capita real income will increase 62 per cent by 1980. As a result of steps taken during the Second Plan, it is now possible to determine long term targets in  some sectors of the economy. The development of transport and power are two basis requirements for economic growth. Roads are the primary means of transport on Nepal. A long term road development programme has been prepared which calls for 2,500 miles of road construction over the twenty year. Free and compulsory primary education will be provided nationally by 1980 in accordance with UNESCO targets. In some sectors, major projects will take relative long periods of time to complete. One major hydro-electric project on the Karnali, for example, may take eight to ten years. To coordinate these several programmes, a long term perspective plan is needed. Third Plan Targets The national income target of the Third Plan is to achieve a total increase of 19 per cent. This will give a nine per cent increase in per cent income over the plan period, assuming a population growth of two per cent per year. This is not ambitious in terms of doubting income over the next plan periods, but it does appear ambitious in the light of the present absorptive capacity of the economy. The Plan calls for total expenditure of Rs 2,500 million in public and private sectors. Of this, Rs 520 million will be spent on the private sector, Rs 240 million by district and village panchayats on district and local development activity, as distinguished from public sector expenditures by the central government. During the Second Plan, development expenditures in the public sector averaged Rs 200 million per year as compared with the projected Third Plan average of Ts 350 million. In the last year of the Second Plan, however, expenditures in the public sector alone amounted to Rs 260 million. They are expected to rise gradually over the next five years. Objectives of the Third Plan The primary objective is to develop the prerequisite for rapid economic growth. The Plan must, however, encompass programmes designed to meet immediate problems as well as those which are essential to future growth. More specific objectives are given below: Agriculture Production In order to achieve the target of increasing total output by 19 per cent, agricultural production must rise. The increase can be achieved by introducing modern techniques to replace the existing primitive practices. The experience of India demonstrates that rapid economic growth cannot occur unless agriculture is properly developed. This is particularly important in the case of food production. The economic condition of the tiller is adversely affected by insecurity of tenure, high rents and high interest rates. A primary objective of the Third Plan, therefore, is to improve the condition of the tiller by effectively implementing the land reform programme. Industrial Development However, development of industries requires a reasonable level of agricultural and infrastructure development. The Plan, therefore, aims at developing industries wherever feasible. Industrial development can occur in both the public and the private sector. In the light of the limited resources available, it is not desirable to restrict the development to one sector. Special efforts will be made in the public sector to ensure the establishment of basic and essential industries. Associated with the growth is a rising demand for capital goods and raw materials which must be important. Therefore, Nepal will have to earn and spend more foreign exchange, particularly convertible currencies, in the years ahead. India is Nepal’s primary and predominant trading partner. Nepal’s exports are prese ntly limited to a few products. In order to diversify trade, agriculture and industry must be developed to produce additional goods for export. In addition, new market for Nepal’s exports must be developed. Social Justice Social justice depends upon the allocation of the benefits of economic growth to large numbers of people. If the benefits are secured only by a small group, the active support and cooperation of the people cannot be secured. The land reform programme is one major measure designed to improve the economic condition of the people of Nepal. The progressive direct taxes which have been introduced are also designed to distribute benefits more widely. The Mulki Ain, a legal code designed to eliminate individual distinctions based upon caste and religious distinctions, was adopted in the Second Plan and will be supported vigorously in the Third Plan. Social justice covers more than an equitable distinction of income and land ownership. Education, health and other social services also help raise the living condition of the people. The manner in which these measures will be stressed will be outlined in later sections. To the extent that the panchayat system is effectively utilized, facilities will be made available to the largest number of people. By initiating programmes in regions, the benefits would also be dispersed geographically. Priorities of the Plan Because of the widespread demands on scarce resources, priorities must be established among the many possible activities. The planning process itself involves as determination of priorities which is affected by existing conditions and the necessity of emphasizing those activities which will most effectively stimulate further development. Agriculture plays a particularly important role in the initial stages of economic development. It provides the foods requirements for industrial workers, the raw materials for industry, and earns foreign exchange with which to by needed imports. Moreover, in Nepal, ninety per cent of the people are dependent upon agriculture for their live hood. An agricultural revolution is a necessary condition for rapid growth. To achieve this, not only should modern agricultural techniques be made available but the benefits of increased production should accrue to the cultivator. The Land Reform programme is designed to accomplish the latter goal. But this alone cannot improve the economic condition of the tiller. Production loans, cottage industry development, cooperative credit, marketing societies, and resettlement programmes are also needed. In the light of these considerations, the highest priority has been given to agricultural development. Next in order of priorities is the development of industry. Industrial expansion depends upon the development of transport and power, and the availability of raw materials and other resources. Industrial development, on the other hand, stimulated the expansion of related supporting activities. In the long term, industrialization is essential, and its development should be given maximum stimulus. CHAPTER III Investment Allocation The Third Plan calls for expenditures of Rs 2,500 million which will increase total gross domestic product by 19 per cent. Plan expenditures by 1969-70 will be some nine per cent of gross domestic product as compared to an estimated six per cent in 1964-65. Total development expenditures are expected to rise from Rs 324 million in the last year of the Second Plan to Rs 600 million by 1969-70.1 It should be noted that not all expenditures can be classified as investment. Some expenditure will meet recurring costs- e.g. allocations to education, publicly, broadcasting, malaria eradication, health, and various training programmes. A substantial proportion of Plan expenditures, however, will finance construction and the purchase of equipment. Some sixty per cent of Plan expenditures will be covered by foreign assistance. A detailed analysis of financial sources in given later, but the proportion of foreign assistance in the Third Plan will be lower than in the Second. Nepal’s absorptive capacity has been raising ray. This is seen from the expansion of expenditures over the Second Plan period and the fact that the Second Plan expenditures target has been achieved. The increasing availability of trained manpower, timely procurement and distribution of building materials, and the improvement of administrative efficiency are all important factors contributing to this result. If absorptive capacity rises further as expected, the Plan targets are clearly achievable. Public Sector Expenditures Out of the Rs 2.500 million to be spent during the Third Plan, the public, panchayat and private sector allocations are Rs 1,740, Rs 240 and Rs 520 million respectively. The public sector allocation includes development target expenditures, commodity assistance and equipment and supplies provided directly by aid - giving nations.2 In the past few years, development expenditures have been rising rapidly. In 1962-63, Rs 70 million were spent out of the development budget. By 1964-65, it rose to RS 235 million. In addition, there are direct expenditures by the aid-giving nations on aided projects. Spending capacity must be increased further in view of Nepal’s needs and aspirations. The Third Plan calls for public sector development expenditures of Rs 310 million in the first year rising to Rs 390 million by 1969- 70. In the light of past performances such an increase in absorptive capacity is feasible. Panchayat Sector Expenditures The mobilization of labour and other resources through the panchayat system is extremely important for social and economic development. As income levels rise over time, the panchayat capacity to mobilize resources will increase. In addition, greater authority will be given to the panchayat organizations in accord with the decentralization programme. Major responsibilities will be given to the zonal, district and gram panchayat. The compulsory savings scheme instituted under the land reform programme will be an important source of funds for the panchayats. Since the capital, technical skill, and foreign exchange requirements for these are activities relatively limited, they can be effectively handled by the panchayats. Private Sector Expenditures The Plan calls for Rs 520 million of investment expenditures in the private sector. In the absence of data, it is difficult to estimate the allocation to the several fields of the private sector. Most private investment presently takes place in agriculture, industry and housing. These come to Rs 50 million for 1964-65. Two factors should be noted. First, these expenditures include funds to be mage available to the private sector by the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, the Cooperative Bank, the Nepal Bank Ltd., and other government-financed credit institutions. These cover industry, agriculture, transport and housing. Cultivators’ investment on a self -help basis is not included. Some of the factors affecting industrial development are mentioned in the industrial policy section. Among these are the degrees of tariff protection, tax policy, import licensing, foreign exchange facilities, etc. These factors will be studied and improved as necessary to provide a suitable climate for long term growth and to facilities expansion. Allocation of Plan Expenditures The allocation of Plan expenditures, based upon the objective and priorities as discussed earlier, and presented in Table 5. The largest proportion of resources goes into development of transport, communication, and power. This takes 37 per cent of total Plan expenditures. Transport and power development is highly capital intensive and requires large amounts of funds. Thus, this sector is allocated more funds than agriculture, which is given top priority. Moreover, the amount of funds allocated to agriculture is not the full measure of expenditures which affect agricultural development. Development of industry, transport and power also benefit and stimulate agricultural expansion. Not all of the private sector investment in agriculture is included in the Plan. Construction and improvement of field channels and drainage facilities, terracing and clearance, undertaken by cultivators, are not included. All of these factors must be kept in mind in assessing the allocation. In the private sector, expenditures are allocated to industry, agriculture, transport and housing. Governmental resources have been concentrated more on expanding economic overhead in the form of transport, power and communication which will stimulate agriculture, industry, and transport in the private sector. Basis for Sectoral Expenditures The amounts allocated to each sector were determined on the basis of projects and activities to be undertaken by each department. These allocations do not necessarily cover the full cost of such activities. In some instances, the projects will extend into the next plan period. In other cases, allocations were made without the technical studies which were needed for detailed cost estimates. This applies more to major projects involving construction than to other types of programmes. Therefore, as more data become available, adjustments will be necessary within the overall Plan total. Availability of Resources Money is not the only resources required for the implementation of the Third Plan. In addition, trained manpower, construction materials, and other resources are necessary. Resource limitations have been one of the primary obstacles to a more rapid expansion of the capacity of Nepal. In making the sectoral allocations, foreign exchange, construction material, manpower requirement, transport facilities and other relevant factors have been taken into account. Programmes are, to the maximum extent possible based upon present and realistically anticipated availabilities of the required factors. Need of Maintenance In view of the present state of limited scarce resources, it is necessary to exploit one of the existing projects to the maximum rather than merely constructing new projects. The nation’s production can be raised without investing any additional capital, if the available roads, bridges, schools, hospital and so forth are utilized fully. So, the present Plan has laid an emphasis upon the maintenance programme in order to have optimum benefit out of them. In Table 6, public sector expenditures are allocated among various departmental categories. The sector totals are the same as those given in column one of Table 5. CHAPTER IV Development Policy Plan programmes must be based upon plan objectives and the policies to be implemented in the several sectors. Theses policies reflect not only activities to be undertaken by government but also assistance and facilities to be made available to the private sector. This will help clarify the relationship between public and private components of the economy. Another purpose of governmental policy formulation is to eliminate barriers to successful development. The programmes incorporated in the Plan are based upon certain principles and polices. The more important policies concerning agriculture, industry, trade and prices are discussed below: Industrial Policy Industrialization plays a vital role in accelerating economic development. His Majesty’s Government is committed to supporting further development of the industrial sector. Rather than getting involved in arguments about the relative roles of the private and public sectors. His Majesty’s Government has taken a pragmatic view. In order to promote the industrial development in the private sector, His Majesty’s Government will give special attention to available economic overheads such as transport and power. Government will provide financial and technical assistance to private development. Measures will be taken, however, to ensure that such development will be beneficial to the nation. Where the needs are greater that can be handled by the private sector, public sector units will be established. Because public resources are limited, they must be direct to such areas as roads, power and social services. Thus emphasis is placed upon private sector for development. Government will, however, provide necessary assistance. Some of the facilities and concessions presently available are: 1. Income Tax Exemption- New industries are not subject to income tax for ten years after the commencement of business. Thereafter, exemption may be granted wholly or partially as considered desirable. 2. Export Duty Exemption- New and old firms undertaking exports may be gives full or partial import duty exemption for specified periods. 3. Import Duty Exemption- Imports of machinery spare parts, and raw materials may be given full or partial import duty exemption for specified periods. 4. Foreign Exchange - Foreign exchange will be made available to purchase machinery, spare parts and raw materials which are unavailable, or available in inadequate quantities in Nepal and for the remuneration of foreign technicians. 5. Repatriation of Profit- Any person investing foreign capital in industry shall be allowed to repatriate during any single year profits up to ten per cent of the capital investment. 6. Repatriation of Capital - Foreign investors making investments in scarce currency will be allowed to repatriate their investment. During any single year, such investors will be allowed foreign exchange for repatriation up to 25 per cent of their investment. 7. Acquisition of Land and Timber- Assistance will be provided in land acquisition and timber needed for construction will be sold at a 15 per cent discount from the auction rate. For industries which are considered essential to Nepal, His Majesty’s Government will consider the provision of additional facilities as required. In addition, loans and technical assistance are available though the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation. Trade Policy In the modern age, no country can develop without trade relations with other countries. Developing nations must import technical skills and capital equipment. Development has, therefore, been associated historical with an increasing volume of trade. The limited market in a small country like Nepal indicates that industrial development will also depend upon exports. The present relatively low level of trade which Nepal has with other countries is a reflection of its low income level and underdevelopment. Steps will be taken during the Third Plan to expand and diversify trade. The main objectives of Nepal’s trade policy will be to increase the volume of exports, the variety of products exported and to diversify markets. Nepal’s imports are bound to rise in the years ahead as income levels rise and development activities expand. Recent trade data have yet to be tabulated and published. Therefore, estimates of import -export levels over the Third plan period cannot be formulated. However, it is apparent that export earnings must increase to finance the large volume of imports needed. Special attention will, therefore be given to export expansion. Efforts will also be made to diversify the direction of trade. At present Nepal’s trade is almost wholly with India and insignificant with other countries. With accelerated development, imports of machinery and construction materials from overseas will increase. To finance these purchases, increased exports outside of India are essential. To encourage this increase provision has been made for the exports to utilize a portion of the earning to import goods into Nepal. In addition, steps will be taken to make Nepalese products more competitive in the world market by reducing costs and ensuring quality standards. Imports into Nepal from overseas countries are subject to import licensing. This has been imposed to restrict the import of luxury goods. The available funds are needed to purchase essential development goods. Foreign exchange transaction with overseas countries will continue to be subject to licensing during the Third Plan. Changes will be made in customs tariffs as required to restrict luxury good imports. Policy will be implemented to ensure that export-import activities are primarily for the nations benefited. If necessary, export- import activities will also be undertaken by government. The National Trading Corporation will play an important role in this filed. The recently organized Food Corporation also has a significant role in this connection. Agricultural Policy The Plan has placed primary emphasis upon the accelerated development of agriculture. In the past, the absence of an overall programme for agriculture has hindered development. In the Third Plan, emphasis is placed upon an integrated agricultural development programme based upon specific objectives rather than piecemeal projects and programmes. There are two factors involved in agricultural development. The first in the expansion of agricultural output. The second is the transfer of human and capital resources from agriculture to other sectors. These two components are closely related. The expansion of agricultural output depends upon the adoption of new and improved agricultural techniques. The improvement of techniques will not only stimulate increased production but facilities the transfer of resources to other sectors. At present, the Nepalese economy is heavily based upon agriculture. In the long run, this dependence must be reduced as economic growth is historically associated with population depends on agriculture and 65 per cent of gross domestic products come from this sector, Nepal must depend heavily on this sector for the generation of additional savings. Because of the major differences in topography, soils and climate conditions in Nepal, no single pattern of agricultural activity is feasible. In the hills and mountain areas, cultivable land and irrigation facilities are limited by the terrain. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on animal husbandry and fruit production. Food grains and cash crops are more suitable for the Terai. When the tempo of development activities expands and urbanization proceeds rapidly food grain demand will also rise. In the next few years, food grains will still be the primary export. Therefore, major emphasis will be given on the expansion of food grain production, because it can be raised in a short period of time with improved techniques. Cultivators must be given every incentive to increase output. Improved seeds, fertilizers and better implements need to be made available at the proper times and places and at reasonable prices. To meet these requirements, an Agricultural Supply Corporation will be established. Cultivators will also need credit to purchase the required inputs. New cooperative societies will be established and existing ones will be strengthened to provide production loans. The Cooperative Bank will make funds available to these societies. Medium and long term loans to individual cultivators will also be made available. An agricultural Bank also will be established to provide loans to individual cultivators at low interest rate. The agricultural extension programme will be expanded and further strengthened. The land reform programme designed to protect tenancy rights and to prevent exploitation by landlords, merchants and money lenders will be completed during the Third Plan. Prices received by the cultivators will affect their willingness to apply more modern techniques. Steps will be taken to ensure incentive price and to improve marketing efficiency. Landlords who do not cultivate their own lands will be encouraged to put their resources to the industrial sector. To reduce the pressure of population on land in the hill regions, some of the present population will be resettled in the Terai and Inner Terai. Efforts will be made to encourage the movement of labour from agriculture to the construction and industrial sectors. Price Policy Over the past few years, consumer goods prices have been rising. The experience of other developing nations indicates that prices tend to rise in the process of development. However, a rapid rate of increase will adversely affect development effort by hitting fixed income groups and stimulating speculative rather that productive use of saving. And, it will be more difficult to achieve the Plan targets due to the rise in the costs. Every effort will therefore, be made to maintain a stable price level, particularly for construction materials and daily necessities. The following are a list of factors responsible for rising in Nepal: 1. Due to rising development expenditures, Government expenditures during the Second Plan have more than doubled. In a low income country like Nepal, a large par of any increase in income is spent on the purchase of food and other essential consumer goods. This tends to push the prices of these goods upward. Prices are also under pressure due to increasing population. 2. Because of the open border with India, Indian prices, particularly of food grains, affect prices in Nepal. Indian food prices have been rising rapidly over the past few years. In addition, since most consumer goods are imported from India, inflationary pressures in India affect the prices of these goods in Nepal. 3. Because of underdeveloped transport, isolated areas may suffer shortages and price increase although the nation as s whole has a surplus. 4. The rapid expansion of money supply in Nepal is another factor. An increase in money supply is necessary to accommodate increased output and the monetization of the economy but the present rate of expansion is in excess of the rate required for the above purposes. Regional Development Policy Accelerated economic development requires the implementation of proper policies and institutional improvements on a national scale. Geographic concentration of Plan activities will not necessarily be conductive to overall national development. Development should take into account regionally available resources and productive factors. The natural and human resources available in the several regions of Nepal vary both in variety and quantity. Even those natural resources which have been located and identified differ in accessibility and case of development. Other cooperating factors are also required. For example transport, communication, power and trained personnel are required for the development of available natural resources. These essential facilities cannot be provided throughout Nepal in the present situation. Because of these limitations, priority will be given to particular regions. The availability of natural resources, transport facilities, topography and related factors will determine the regions which priority. On this basis, Nepal can be divided into three regions: the Karnali, the Koshi, and the Gandak-Bagmati river basins. At present, development activities are centered in the Gandk-Bagmati region. However, there are a number of development activities underway in theKoshi region. The Karnli region is in the preliminary stage of development. 2. The second basis of regional differentiation is topography, and on this basis the country can be divided into three regions— the Terai, the Hills, and the Himalyan belt. Most of the development activity is concentrated in the Terai and a small part of the hill area. This reflects the relative development of the economic overhead facilities in the several areas. In the agricultural sector, food grains and cash crops will be emphasized in the Terai, horticulture in the hills, and anima l husbandry in the northernmost region. Industrial development in the hills is possible but will occur slowly because of transport and power limitations. It is desirable to divide the nation into regions to provide a basis for regional planning. Regional planning must be based upon resources availability and developmental potential. However, there is still a considerable gap in the knowledge about the existence of mineral resources, their quality, and their volume in these regions. Emphasis will be placed on survey activities to locate and explore available resources. Since, the Himalayan and the far western regions have been most neglected; special attention will be given to their development. Health, education, cottage industries and agricultural extension services, to mention a few, are activities with a national scope and will be expanded in all regions. The Panchayat system has encouraged the undertaking of local improvement works thought the nation. These have helped to maintain and stimulate regionally balanced development. The decentralization programme will give further encouragement to local initiative and interest for local and regional development. CHAPTER V Financing the Plan Since 1956, when His Majesty’s Government introduced the First Plan, the absorptive capacity of the economy has been increasing. The financial and physical resources required for development have expanded correspondingly. In the past, the absorptive capacity was less than the amount of financial resources available. During the past few years however, spending capacity has increased to such an extent that the availability of financial resources has become a limiting factor. The rate of investment in Nepal is very low. During the Third Plan it is expected to rise nine per cent of gross domestic product. This is still low compared to other developing nations, but in the light of past experience, it appears reasonable. Even so, greater effort in both the public and private sectors will be required to achieve such a goal. A Review of the Second Plan During the Second Plan, some Rs 600 million was estimated to have been spent in the public sector. Of this amount, it was planned that Rs 100 million would be financed internally (Rs 50 million from domestic revenues, Rs 10 million from internal loans and Rs 40 million, was to be financing). Despite the pressure of increased prices and annual salary increments, regular expenditures were held to Rs 124.3 million in the first years Rs 114.3 million in the second and Rs 127.0 million in the final year. During this period, governmental tax and other receipts rose from Rs 129.0 million to Rs 188.5 million or almost 50 per cent. Total budgetary saving amounted to Rs 107.1 million over the period. In addition, Rs 20.6 million was secured from internal bond issues. Total internal financing including expenditure outlay cash balances amounted to Rs 133.40 million. Since the balance was provided by foreign assistance totaling Rs 470 million, the need for deficit originally planned was eliminated. Table 7 gives the sources of development budget expenditures in further detail. Table 8 gives the direct expenditure of the various aid agencies for development purposes. These do not go through H. M. G. development budget. Preferably, all development expenditure should be reflected in the annual budget. Steps are being taken to do this — e.g. not that in the third column to Table 8, direct expenditures by India are not shown because these are now channeled through His Majesty’s Government. In the past, there has been a considerable gap between actual expenditures and budgeted amounts. This difference has, however, been decreasing. In 1963-64, for example, actual expenditures were 70 per cent of the budget. In the following year, the proportion rose to 80 per cent. Over the next five years, this gap is expected to be further reduced. Financial Resources for the Third Plan As presented in Chapter III, Rs 2,500 million will be spent in the public, panchayat, and private sectors during the Third Plan period. In addition, His Majesty’s Government will provide Rs 210 million to the private and panchayat sectors in the form of loans and subsidies. Sources of Internal resources From the additional taxes levied in 1964-65, there will be an increase of total tax receipts from Rs 188.5 million to Rs 224.2 million. Regular expenditures are expected to increase from Rs 127.0 million to Rs 216.2 million. During the Plan period as a result of governmental efforts, customs receipts will increase. In underdeveloped countries like Nepal, government collected 10 to 12 per cent of national income. Therefore, there is scope for further increase in revenue by His Majesty’s Government. By introducing new taxes and increasing existing rates an additional Rs 322.3 million will be collected over the Plan period. Although, 65 percent of gross domestic product comes from the agricultural sector, less than 25 per cent of government income comes from taxation of agriculture. There is considerable scope for increasing taxes in the agricultural sector to finance During the Plan period, therefore, taxes in this sector such as the land tax will have to be increased. In order to increase government income, rates of the custom duty will be studies and changed as necessary. Social attention will be paid to basic consumer and development goods. Increased tax rates and receipts will occur in this sector. Encouragement will be given both in the public and private sectors to produce goods not presently produced in Nepal. Theses new goods will be taxed as necessary to increase governmental receipts. Nepal’s rates of income taxes are lower than those of many underdeveloped countries. The maximum rate is 40 per cent of income. These rates need to be increased to raise more revenues. In order to reduce income differentials in Nepal, direct taxes should be levied. Since income levels are very low. The number of taxpayers will be quite small. Through these taxes alone, therefore, the development programmes cannot be fully financed. Indirect taxes will still continue to be an important source of income in the years ahead. Sales taxes will be levied during the Plan period. In other countries, low sales taxes are an important source of governmental receipts. In addition, financial conditions and financial administration in Nepal will be studies and additional indirect taxes levied. Internal Loans The system of raising internal loans for the country’s economic development started only two years ago. Two years, experience has been quite encouraging. Funds totaling Rs 13.1 million were generated in the second year of the Three Year Plan through the issue of government development bonds. Over the Third Plan Period, Rs 10 million will be raised annually, making a total of Rs 50 million to be spent on development projects. India: The major projects started during the Second Plan will be completed in the Third Plan period, the estimated cost to run them being 200 million. United States : Assistance from the United States each year is expected to remain at roughly the same level during the Third Plan as in the Second Grant assistance is expected to total Rs 310 million. Another, Rs 70 million will be received from general commodity assistance and in the form of machinery and equipment for the East-West Highway, giving a total of Rs 380 million for various development projects. In addition, Rs 90 million 5The total expenditures to complete these projects are es timated at Rs 480 million. Actual assistance received during the Plan period will be somewhat\\\\hat smaller since some of the projects will be carried over to the Fourth Plan. will be provided for technical assistance and training facilities. These latter costs are not included in Plan expenditures and therefore are in addition to the Rs 1,250 million of foreign assistance expected. U. S. S. R.: During the Third Plan the Simra-Janakpur highway and an agricultural implement factory will be constructed with Soviet assistance. People’s Republic of Chins: The Kathmandu-Kodari road and the brick and tile factory will be completed during the Plan period. Third Plan expenditures on those two projects are estimated at Rs 60 million. Additional projects will also be started with Chinese assistance.6 Other Assistance: Additional assistance will also be received from Germany, the United Kingdom, The United Nations, and Australia. Switzerland, New Zealand and the Ford Foundation. Economic and technical assistance for transport development is expected from the International Development Association. Technical Assistance In addition to financial assistance, technical and advisory personnel have been provided by friendly nations and international agencies. Their cost to the assisting nation amounts to Ts 10 million annually. Because of the storage of technicians and professionally trained manpower in Nepal, there will be a continuing need for foreign technical assistance during the Third Plan. The cost of these technicians has not been included in the Plan total. Cost data is difficult to obtain and the benefits from technicians’ services are equally difficult to measure in monetary terms. Nepal will continue to send its young men and women abroad for specialized training because of the limited facilities available within the country. As the cost of training varies widely from country, this also has not been included in the Plan. Panchayat Sector It is estimated that Rs 340 million will be collected under the compulsory saving component of the land reform programme over the Third Plan. Out of this, Rs 180 million will be used to provide credit to the tillers. The balance of Rs 160 million will be net saving. Local panachayat resources are estimated at Rs 40 million over the Plan period. Therefore, Rs 200 million will be made available from the panchayat sector. Private Sector Over the third plan Rs 520 million will be invested by the private sector of this total Rs 350 million will be secured from private savings. The balance will consist of loans from the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, the Cooperative Bank, and other governmentally supported financial institution. Monetary Policy The establishment of the central bank, the Nepal Rastra Bank, in 1965, filled a major gap in the monetary system. In its initial years, the Bank did little more than act as banker to the government. During that period, Indian currency circulated freely throughout the country. The exchange rate between Indian and Nepalese currencies, however, fluctuated considerably. Beginning in 1960, however, the Nepal Rastra Bank stabilized the exchange rate, fixing it at Rs 100 IC, and was put to an end the years, unstable exchange rate of Indian and Nepalese currency. Various measures were taken during the Second Plan period to convert to a single currency system. As a consequence, the use of Nepali currency is expanding, while the circulation of Indian currency is declining. By the end of the Third Plan, it is expected that Indian currency will no longer be used for commercial transaction in Nepal. 6The total Chinese assistance on these projects is Ts 250 million. Since some of the larger projects will not be completed during the Plan period, actual expenditures will be somewhat smaller. The quantity of Nepalese currency in circulation increased rapidly during the Second Plan period. One of the reasons for the expansion of the expansion of the money supply is the replacement of Indian currency. The actual increase in money supply cannot be determined since there is no data on the amount of Indian currency withdrawn over the Plan period. It appears, however, that the total money supply expanded considerably with attendant pressures on prices. During the Third Plan period, a detailed study will be made of the rate of increasing of the money supply needed to meet trade and commerce requirements. The Governments will then limit the expansion of Indian currency balances. With the establishment of her own currency system, Nepal is now in a position to influence the price t hrough monetary policies. Foreign Exchange Since November, 1960, all convertible currency transactions have been handled through the Nepal Rastra Bank. In July, 1960 the Bank held Rs 55.75 million of convertible currencies and gold. By January, 1965, convertible reserves had risen to Rs 192.71 million, an increase of 248 per cent. Similarly, inconvertible foreign exchange during this period rose from Rs 82.1 million to Rs 204.7 million. Total foreign currency receipts over the Second Plan period cannot be estimated because of the absence of data. Some parts of Nepal still use Indian currency to transact business across the border. This practice has complicated the analysis of foreign exchange receipts. The balance of Indian currencies held in the Central bank has also increase considerably. To hold foreign balances in excess of normal requirements is undesirable from the economic point of view. Therefore during the Third Plan, foreign exchange will be utilized for maximum benefit to the economy. The cost of construction materials, equipment and other imports to be financed by aid-giving countries has not been included in Table 12. The amount of such assistance will depend on the projects to be undertaken by the several nations. Even for projects already committed the data necessary to estimate import costs are not available. Financial Institutions In order to mobilize internal and external resources most effectively, it is necessary to strengthen the financial institutions in Nepal. The commercial bank and other institutions have provided short term loans at relatively low interest rates for commerce, trades and industry. Long term loans are also needed for industrial and agricultural development. Financial institutions to meet these requirements are essential for economic growth. His Majesty’s Government has taken various steps to collect available savings including the establishment of specialized financial institutions. During the next five years, the existing institutions will be strengthened and new units established as required. Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) NIDC was established as a government corporation in 1954 to provide financial and technical assistance to the private sector. During 1960-61 loans and equity participation of Rs 411 thousand were made available to private companies. Over the Second Plan period, another more than Rs 30 million was made available. During the Third Plan, the activities of the Corporation will be expanded still further. Cooperative Bank The Cooperative Bank was established during the Second Plan to provide loans funds to cooperative societies and individual farmers for agricultural development. During the Second Plan, the bank made loans totaling approximately Rs 1.6 million. The organization of the bank will be strengthened and it is operations greatly expanded. National Commercial Bank The Nepal Bank, established in 1938, is at present the only commercial bank in Nepal. As this bank alone cannot meet the financial requirements of commerce, trade and industry, a new bank, the Nepal Commercial Bank has been established in the public sector. This institution will begin operations during the Third Plan. It will develop banking facilities in areas which are presently not served by a commercial bank and operate as an agent of the Nepal Rastra Bank. This will relieve the Rastra Bank of some of its present functions and enable it to concentrate its efforts upon improving the monetary system of the country. Agricultural Bank At present, there is not institution beside the Cooperative Bank to provide medium and long term loans to cultivators for agricultural development. Since the existing bank cannot effectively provide loan facilities both the cooperative societies and individual farmers, a separate bank will be established during the Third Plan. Insurance Companies Insurance enterprises have been as important source of savings in developed and developing countries. Nepal as yet has not been able to establish its own insurance companies. These functions are presently handled by foreign firms. Premium collections are estimated at Rs 8 million annually. In order to keep these funds within the country, insurance activities will be initiated during the coming plan period. Stock Exchange Stock exchanges play an important role in the development of financial institutions and the channeling of savings into investment opportunities. Plans are therefore being made to establish a stock exchange in Nepal. CHAPTER VI Population and Manpower Manpower is the most important resource of any nation. The future of a country which has a literate, healthy and hard working population is bright regardless of the availability of other resources. One measure of development is the level of production. This is affected not only by the numbers but also the quality of the labour force. Labour quality is dependent upon literacy, physical and intellectual development, and technical knowledge and the adaptability of the workers to new environments. Population growth also vitally affects economic development. A rapid rate of growth tends to hold back development. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the existing population and its anticipated growth as a part of the planning process. Population The first national population census was taken in 1911-12. It counted 5,638.749 persons in Nepal. Population censes have been taken every ten years since then. The first census bases on international standards were conducted in 1952-54. The difficult nature of the terrain, the poor transport facilities and the shortage of trained manpower made it necessary to spread the field activities over tow years, thus casting some doubt upon the reliability of the figures. The latest census, 1961-62, was completed within a shorter period and more modern techniques were applied. The results are, therefore, presumed to be more accurate. Population Increase From 1910-11 to 1961-62, population increased by 3,841,650 or 68.12 per cent. This is an average annual increase of 1.4 per cent. As a result of health services expansion, life expectancy is rising and the rate of population increase has undoubtedly also risen. Between the censuses of 1954 and 1961, the rate of increase averaged 1.6 per cent annually. The rate has undoubtedly risen further and is probably about 2.0 per cent at present. A sample survey of births and deaths in 1964 tends to confirm the 2.0 per cent rate. An analytical study of the latest census data indicates that the infant mortality rate is 244 per 1,000 births; the birth rate 41.1; and the death rate, 20.8. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 32.01 years. The death rate is expected to decline further as medical facilities expand. The birth rate is not expected to decline significantly unless fairly planning programmes are effectively implemented. Thus, the rate of increase is most likely to rise in the years ahead. An estimate of future population is given in Table 13. The estimates are based upon the 1961-62 census data plus result of sample surveys and other studies. The rate of increase during the Third Plan is estimated at two percent annum, during 1970-75 at 2.2 per cent and over 1975-80 at 2.4 per cent. Age Distribution The increase from 1065 to 1980 is estimated at 3,974,298. The 0-14 age group now contain 40 per cent of the total population, the 15-59 age groups 54.8 per cent, and the 60 and over group 5.2 per cent. The portion in the non-productive age groups is relatively high: 45.2 per cent of the population falls in the dependent-age categories. This percentage is likely to rise in the future. Unemployment in the 15-59 age group may raise and female participation in the labour force in likely to rise as development occurs. A reduction of the birth rate usually occurs only over a period of years. The death rate is likely to fall more rapidly. The primary education age group, 6-10, will increase by 50 percent. These will be an increase of 2,200,000 in the 15-59 age groups. The population pressure on land will further increase and more resourc es must be directed toward creating new employment opportunities. Simply to maintain present per capita income, production must increase. Scarce resources will be absorbed in maintaining income levels rather than increasing them. This emphasized the necessity of undertaken an effective and widespread family planning programme. Increasing population means greater population density. At present there is an average of 175 persons per square mile. Because of the topography, cultivable lands in limited and density per cultivable area is mush higher. As shown in Table 14, population density in the Terai per unit of cultivated area is less than in the hills. This indicated the desirability of shifting some of the hill population to the Terai. Unless the transfer is made, per capita production in the hill areas is likely to decline with further population increase. Labour Force The labour force in Nepal is defined as the group above the age of 15: at present the total is estimated to be 4,307,222 as shown in Table 15. Table 15 shows labour force data. per cent in industry, 1.5 per cent in service, less than 1.0 per cent in commerce and 1.7 per cent in other occupations. A large proportion of the labour force in non-agricultural activities is found in Kathmandu. In the Terai and in the hills, the agricultural proportion is correspondingly high. A comparative study of the censuses of 1952-54 and 1961-62, shows that 50 per cent of the population was counted as in the labour force in the earlier period with equal male and female participation. By 1961-62 only 43.8 per cent was included. The reason for the decrease is due to the expansion of educational facilities. The proportion of the population considered literate in 1952-54 was 4.4 per cent. Of this group, 60 per cent had attended or were attending Primary School, 26 per cent Secondary School and 13 per cent College. By 1961-62, 8.9 per cent of the populations were in the literate category. Of these, the Primary School portion had risen to 72 per cent, the Secondary School portion to 18 per cent, 7 per cent in the intermediate degree category and 3 per cent in the higher levels of college training. Assuming that the labour force increases at the same rate as the population, and in the same proportion for agriculture and other sectors the pressure on agricultural occupations will increase. Therefore, employment opportunities outside of agriculture muse expand, not only to stimulate economic growth but also to maintain existing income levels. One of the primary objectives of the Third Plan, therefore, is to transfer labour from agriculture to other sectors. Technical Manpower Technically trained manpower is required to implement the development programmes. One of the main difficulties in carrying through development projects in the past few years has been the storage of trained technicians. In order to overcome this storage, various training facilities were set up during the First and Second Plan periods. In addition, men and women were sent abroad for training. Although these steps have helped overcome the problem, the shortage is still not fully met. More trained manpower will be required as the pace of development activity expands. The following factors must be considered. 1. The time required to train technicians and professional people. At least five to six years are required to train doctors, engineers and high level technicians. Two to three years are needed for overseers, nurses and agricultural assistants. Therefore, the training programmes and the numbers to be rained should be determined in terms of a long term development perspective. For example, those sent for end of the Plan. 2. Experience shows that the ratio of middle level technicians to professional manpower need is at least 3 or 4 to one. The ratio of skilled workers such as brick layers and carpenters to middle grade technicians is about four or five to one. The experience of other nations shows that middle level technicians will be in short supply, but in Nepal even low level technicians are in short supply. In some instances, the aid - giving nations will provide technicians to meet these shortages. Training Policy Governmental policy is to provide training facilities within the country for all except a few specialists. During the Second Plan, Training facilities were provided within Nepal for middle level technicians. These will consist of an agricultural college, an engineering college and a medical school. Because of the time necessary to establish these institutions, their output will not enter the market until the last years of the Third Plan or in the Fourth Plan. Therefore, outside training facilities for high level technicians will be expanded. At present, there are virtually no training facilities for skilled workers and low level technicians expect in the agriculture and forestry areas. Training Facilities Under the foreign scholarship programme students will continue to be sent abroad for training. In the past three years, the numbers who have been sent abroad is 996. The number 543 is highest in technical fields such as engineering, health, and agriculture. Of the total, 51 per cent or 517 were sent to India, 142 to the United States, 76 to the USSR, 66 to the UK, and 24 to China. Students have also been sent to Pakistan, Germany, Israel, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Ceylon and Japan. Within Nepal, an additional 470 were trained in agriculture, 181 in forestry, 130 in engineering, 245 in health, 1,087 in primary education, 1,386 in cottage industries, 1,745 in panchayats and 205 in the cooperative sector. (Detailed data are given in the respective appe nds tables). Trained-Manpower Requirements Table 16 gives an estimate of the additional trained manpower required during the Third Plan, estimated availability and the anticipated gap. Expansion of Training Facilities In order to meet the expanding requirements for trained manpower, existing training facilities will be expanded and new units started. As noted above, an engineering college, a medical school, and an agricultural college will be established. Even with these new facilities available, trained manpower will be inadequate to meet demands. Trained personnel from outside will, therefore, continue to be utilized. There are fourteen training centers for middle -grade technicians. In addition, more limited training programmes are conducted by several government departments. It is evident that additional facilities are required. Other facilities will be established for low level technicians. Efforts will be made to utilize more effectively the services of the retired soldiers who have received technical training abroad. It is estimated that some 300 soldiers with such training retire annually. The largest skill- group consists of machines. Technical Assi stance The technical assistance which Nepal receives from aid -giving agencies is very important because of the limited number of persons with the essential training and experience available in Nepal. Such assistance, moreover, will stimulate the development of local skills and talents. Every effort will be made Nepali Personnel. PART II DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES CHAPTER VII Agricultural Development In addition to the heavy concentration of the labour force in agriculture, the economy as a whole is dominated by this sector: in 1964-65, 65 per cent of the gross domestic product is estimated to have been derived from this sector and eighty-five per cent of current exports consist of agricultural products. Since, Nepal is an agricultural country with a low yield level of output in comparison with other countries, national output is also very low. The world average yields of paddy, maize and wheat are 2,030, 2,080 and 1179 kilograms per hectare; whereas the yields in Nepal are only 1,819, 1,898 and 1,112 kilograms per hectare. In Japan the average yield per hectare of these food grains is 4,700, 2,700 and2.740 kilograms. It is evident that a substantial increase in agricultural output can be achieved through improved techniques. The expenditures required for improving techniques will be less than those required in other areas. Since output can be increased at relatively low cost it is imperative, to meet the target of doubling national income within fifteen years, that major stress be given the development agriculture. Present Condition In the First and Second Plan periods, special attention was given the establishment of experimental farms and livestock centres and the training of middle-grade technicians. At present there are eleven agronomy farms, four crop protection centres, an agricultural implement research and production unit, 16 horticulture centres, four livestock breeding units, two sheep breeding centres, three pig farms two poultry farms, one hatchery, one research station, 33 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, three cheese centres, one central dairy, seven fishery units, a resettlement centre and a tractor station. During the Second Plan period 680 middle-grade technicians were trained. One or more middle-grade technician was sent to 53 of the 75 development districts to participate in the extension programme. Problems of Agricultural Development This will be discussed later. The essential factors for increasing production are improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, crop protection, and improved implements. Unless these factors are effectively combined, agricultural production will not rise. As most of the culti9vators in Nepal are illiterate, they are hesitant to change from their traditional system of cultivation to modern techniques. The seeds used by cultivators are of low quality and subject to insect damage. As a result, yields are low. Thus if improved seeds were uses, a ten per cent increase in production could be achieved. The yield of land declines after continuous cultivation without use of fertilizers. Fertilizers should be applied to maintain and increase crop production. One of the reasons for low yields is the very limited use of fertilizers. Research has shown that the use of one ton of chemical fertilizer will increase food grain production by some ten tons. When the cost of fertilizer and the value of the additional output are taken into account, one rupee spent on fertilizers will bring a return of four rupees. There are only limited irrigation facilities in Nepal. Where such facilities are available, they have not been properly utilized. Although a part of food crops is destroyed by insects cultivators have not given sufficient attention to crop protection. As a result some 15 per cent of the total output is lost through damage. A substantial increase of output can also be achieved by the use of improved agricultural implements. Use of improved ploughs and other implements has taken place on a very limited scale. Total cultivated area is 1,831,000 hectares. Not more than 50,000 kilograms of improved seed were used on, not more than 1,000 hectares annually during the Second Plan period. Annual utilization of chemical fertilizer is only 2,000 metric tons; some 71,000 hectares are under irrigation, which is only four per cent of total cultivated land. Similarly, little use of improved implements been made. Objectives and Targets Agricultural output must be increased to meet the food requirements of the growing population, to priority raw materials for expanding industries and to earn foreign exchange through larger exports. The production of meat, eggs, fruits etc. will also have to be increased to fulfill nutritional requirements more adequately. Sixty per cent of the income from exports is derived from exports of food grains alone. In the light of the above objectives, the Plan target is to increase food grain production by 15 per cent and cash-crop output by 73 per cent. The production target of various food grains and cash crops is given in Table 17. In Table 18 the targets to be achieved are set forth. Components of the agricultural programme which will contribute materially to increase output are set forth in quantitative terms in Table 19. Several of these Paddy is the main crop of Nepal and is cultivated on some 1,100,000 hectares. Since there is little possibility of expanding paddy cultivation into new areas, the target of an increase of 7.5 per cent will be achieved by using improved techniques on 350,000 hectares. On 200,000 hectares of this total, 22 per cent of the increase in production will stem from increased use of chemical fertilizer and 78 per cent from the use of natural fertilizer, improved seed and irrigation water. Improved seeds will be used on 73 thousand hectares, especially in the hill regions. Thirty per cent of the total fertilizer use target will be for paddy. Maize In the hill regions of Nepal, maize is the main food item of the people. Cultivation can be expanded by another 245,000 hectares. Out of 245, hectares, 28.5 thousand will be brought under maize during the Plan period. Manure and other fertilizers will be used on 50 thousand hectares, and hybrid seed will be sown on 28.5 thousand hectares. This program will be emphasized in the Hills and in parts of the Inner Terai. Wheat Winter crop production in Nepal is very limited largely because of the limited availability of water. Wheat is cultivated in some 125.000 hectares; although the total cultivable area on which wheat could be grows is 1.4 million hectares. During the Plan period wheat will be grown on 200,000 hectares and an additional 270,000 metric tons will be produced. Emphasis will be given the use of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers. During the Third Plan period cane will be grown on an additional 5.7 thousand hectares in the districts of Bara, Parsa, Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Banke, Morang and Sarlahi. Improved seeds will be used in the new areas as well as on the presently cultivated lands of Morang, Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Bara and Parsa districts. Emphasis will be placed upon the proper use of fertilizers. Jute Jute is one of our main export crops; in trade beyond India, it is most important. Present, jute is cultivated in Saptari, Morang, and Jhapa districts on 32 thousand hectares. During the coming five years, an additional ten thousand hectares will be sown with jute and annual output by 1969-70 will be 54 thousand metric tons. To increase output improved techniques, improved seeds and chemical fertilizers will be used. To meet the raw material requirements of the existing cigarette factories and export demands, tobacco cultivation will be expanded to cover an additional 15.5 thousand hectares over the present eight thousand hectares. The new areas of cultivation will be in the districts of Sarlahi, Saptari, Mohottari, and in parts of the Inner Terai. By the end of the Plan period annual production will reach an estimated 14 thousand metric tons. Improved techniques and improved seeds will be used in cultivation, particularly those seeds recommended by the cigarette factory such as Virginia Gold, Del Crest and Australist. Oil-seeds Oil-seeds, particularly mustard, are cultivated on 108,000 hectares. Annual production is estimated to be about 51,500 metric tons. To achieve the 18 per cent increase targeted for the Plan period, improved seeds and fertilizers will be applied to 50,000 hectares. Mustard will be planted on additional 7.5 thousand hectares in the districts of Chitawan, Nawalparasi, Dang Deokhuri, Bardia, Kanchanpur and Banke. Thus, an additional nine thousand metric tons of oil-seed will be produced annually. Provision of Necessary Factors of Production The above targets will be achieved by making advances in the following areas: (1) irrigation and soil conservation, (2) use of improved seeds, (3) fertilizer use, (4) crop protection and (5) use of improved techniques. These will be responsible for output increases of 3.5 per cent, five per cent, one per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively During the Second Plan additional 40,628 hectares of land were irrigated by various projects. In the Third Plan 175,000 additional acres of land will be irrigated by various large-scale projects. In addition, in the Terai and the hills, irrigation will be undertaken with tube- well and other arrangements. Soil Conservation As a result of indiscriminate felling of existing forests and transient cultivation practices in some areas, soil erosion has become a major problem in the hills. Therefore, soil conservation will be one of the programmes to be undertaken in the Plan period. Wherever, possible soil conservation schemes will be carried out along with minor irrigation programmes. In this way not only will the soil be protected but additional water will be made available. Under the combined soil protection-irrigation programme, 21,400 hectares will be affected. Improved Seeds Higher yielding seeds are important in increasing agricultural production. During the Plan, 55.5 thousand metric tons of food grain seeds and 96.6 thousand metric tons of cash crops seeds will be required. A five per cent increase in food grain production will be achieved by the use of improved seeds on 800,000 hectares. In the Third Plan, for additional agronomy farms will be established. Research and experimentation on seed varieties will be undertaken on the new farms. After experimental work is completed, the nucleus seed will be grown on government farms and distributed among the registered seed producer. The seed producers in turn will grow the improved seeds under the guidance of the technical advisors to be provided by the government. A system of seed growing will be established. To encourage seed cultivators, seeds will be purchased from through the extension service. Chemical Fertilizers To increase production, the fertility of the soil must be maintained and improved. To achieve this, the plan calls for the use of 108,076 tons of ammonium sulphate, 25,672 metric tons of potassium and 87,467 metric tons of phosphate. By 1969-70, a total 86,262 metric tons of chemical fertilizers will be required annually. At present the application of chemical fertilizers is very limited. As chemical fertilizer use is relatively unknown to the cultivators, a considerable time period will be needed before chemical fertilizer will be extensively used. Cultivators will be encouraged to use them and to grow more than one crop. Because of transport difficulties emphasis will be placed on the regions where such facilities already exist. Marketing and distribution channels must be established. Moreover, fertilizer requirement during the Plan is very large compared with present use. Therefore, agreements should be made well in advance with fertilizer exporting countries. In addition to chemical fertilizer, compost, which can be produced within the country, and green manure are also important in increasing production. As the latter types of fertilizers are known to the cultivators, it should not be difficult to expand their use. Encouragement will be given with the production and use of green manure. Plant Protection An estimated 15 per cent of the total crop production is destroyed by plant diseases and insects. Thus, a corresponding increase in the Plan period could be achieved if the crop were fully protected from damage and destruction. However, it is not possible to carry out such a program for the entire country within a few years. During the Plan period, plant protection will be carried out on 150,000 hectares covering paddy, maize, sugarcane, jute, tobacco and potatoes. Insects such as borers, afid, and others will be controlled by the use of metatoes, folidol, and aldrin chemicals. A plant quarantine program will be carried out to prevent the spread of plant diseases. Agricultural Implements Although some cultivators realize the importance of agricultural implement in increasing output, improved implements are not produced in Nepal but are imported from India. However, they are not suitable to the soil and climate of the country. For example, the India plough is unsuitable because of the size of the local bullocks. This factory produced and sold 4,500 implements and tools. Since this output is very small in relation to the market, the target for third Plan is the establishment of another one or two agriculture implements production and training centres. These plants will produce some 10,000 implements of various types. In addition, the agricultural supply corporation noted below will market various agricultural implements on a commercial basis. Agriculture Supply Corporation An Agriculture Supply Corporation will be established at the ginning of the Plan period to make available improved seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, and agricultural implements. This Corporation will distribute improved seeds. It will also produce, collect and procure improved seeds, test for purity, protect from insects, and grade the seeds. In addition, the Corporation will make available chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agriculture implement, etc. For this, the Corporation will have keep in close contact with the National Trading Company and, extension services, with the Agricultural Department and Cooperative Banks. Its activities should also be coordinated with the agricultural extension and land reform programmes. Horticulture Development Nepal has tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate climates which are suitable for horticulture development. The lower regions of the Himalayan belt and the central regions of the country are better suited for the growing of fruits and vegetables than other agricultural products. During the Second Plan they sold 40 thousand improved fruits saplings, 60 thousand banana, pineapple, other fruit seeds and 7 thousand kilograms of improved vegetable seeds to the cultivators. In Ilam, where potatoes are the main crop, a potato development centre will be established which will produce disease-free stock. During the Plan period, the production of potatoes will be increased by 20 per cent. In addition to the production of fruits and vegetables, attention must be given to their preservation. A preservation centre was established at the Kirtipur Horticulture Centre during the Second Plan. Fruit from Dharan, Dhankuta, Pokhara, etc. is brought to this centre where it is tested, canned and sold. In the Plan period, this centre will be expanded and a similar centre will also be established in Dharan. Tea plantations in Nepal, especially in the eastern region of the country, appear to be profitable. A Tea Development Broad will be established during the Plan period. This Broad wills mange the tea gardens in Ilam and Soktim. The Broad will replant old tea gardens and establish nurseries to provided seeds. It will also encourage private investment in tea plantations. Livestock, Poultry and Fish Improvement Since three-fourths on Nepal’s is covered by hills and mountains, there is great potential fo r livestock development. Pastures in the hills can be extensively developed, although relatively few areas are being used at present. Moreover, the northern part of the country is at a higher elevation and thus isles suited for food grain development. Therefore, livestock improvement will be emphasized in these regions. Cattle As yet, no substantial progress has been made in this field. However, in view of the importance of cattle to the economy, greater stress will be given to this sector in the Third Plan. Brown Swiss, Jersey, Sinthi, and other breeds will be used to improve local cows and increase milk production. Stronger bullocks will be established. A horse farm will be established in Phidim, Mechi Zone, to improve breeds. Sheep Sheep herbing is one of the oldest occupations in the country. In the Himalayan belt, there are many families who raise sheep for their livelihood. But, as a result of lack of knowledge of modern techniques and the poor condition of pastures, sheep production has been declining in recent years. Sheep are being imported to meet the meat and wool requirements of the expanding population. A sheep farm was established in Pokhara during the Second Plan in order to improve the local stock by proper feeding, care, and breeding. The experience of this farm shows that a higher altitude area is required for this purpose. A new sheep farm will be established near Kathmandu during the Plan period. Pastures will be developed to encourage sheep farming. Technical and financial assistance will be given to those interesting in undertaking sheep farming on a commercial basis. Swine Pig farms established in the Rapti and Jiri Valleys have made considerable progress. New farms will be established in Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Bhairahawa, which will make available improved stock to the various regions of Nepal. In the Second Plan, fast growing carp were imported. Israel carp breeding centres are established at Godavari, Janakpur, Pokhara Parwanipur, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar. The fingerlings were made available stock ponds. It is estimated that fish production during 1962-65 in both the private and public sectors was 100 metric tons. During this Plan period two additional fish breeding farms will be opened. The increasing demand for fish as a result of increased incomes has made it essential that fish farming be undertaken on a large scale. A commercial fish farm of 25-40 hectares will be opened at Hetaura to produce fish for sale to customers. By the end of the Plan annual fish production from these farms will be 285 me tric tons. Veterinary Services The provision of veterinary services is one of the major requirements for agricultural development. During the Second Plan, veterinary services were made available throughout Nepal by opening clinics and hospitals in various areas; 33 dispensaries and veterinary hospitals are now operating and a research center was established to produce vaccines. Mass vaccination has been undertaken to eradicate rinderpest. The present Plan aims at making more veterinary facilities available and at opening 12 dispensaries in the less accessible regions of the country. Four check posts will be opened at Butwal, Dharan, Hetaura and Darchula. By the final year of the Plan, the newly established research center will be producing a broad array of animal vaccines. Dairy Farming Dairy development has not been given necessary attention. A cheese processing plant has been installed in Kathnamdu. Nepali cheese has grained a good reputation in foreign markets. During the Third Plan, eight new cheese factories will be established. These will produce 30,000 kilograms of cheese annually and increase the incomes of 500 yak raising families in the northern part on Nepal. It is estimated that annual cheese production will be 46,000 kilograms by 1970. At present, a dairy center is located in Kathmandu. This center collects processes and distributes 500,000 liters of milk. Efforts will be made during the Plan to increase milk production in Kathnmandu Valley and milk will also be collected from outside the Valley. Once this is done the Kathmandu Central Dairy will have a processing capacity of 10,000 liters per day. Carcass Utilization Presently there are inadequate facilities to utilize animal carcasses. Facilities are needed to get maximum benefits. Such plants are needed to make use of carcass components which would otherwise be wasted. These animals feed supplements. Therefore, carcass utilization plants will be established in selected areas during the Plan period. Artificial Insemination The number of cattle in Nepal is estimated at 7,300,000. Breeding must be improved; the livestock improvement programme is designed to improve local breeds. To achieve this, an artificial insemination programme was started five years ago. According to the report on this programme, 70 per cent of the artificial inseminations have been successful. However, there has been relatively little effect upon cattle quality. In the present Plan period, this programme will be gradually expanded. In areas where the concentrated in villages and districts where livestock farms and/or veterinary branches exist. Ninety thousand cows and buffaloes will be artificially inseminated during the Plan period. Programme Relating to Agriculture In addition to the items mentioned above, the agriculture development programme includes other activities. Their purpose is to support and evaluate agriculture development programmes. Some of the main programmes are described below. Agriculture Research Research activities will be undertaken in the various sections of the Agriculture Department. Work will be done to determine suitability in Nepal of agricultural techniques that have been successful in other countries. Efforts will be made to provide the cultivators with help in increasing agricultural production, i.e. by improved seeds, plants, livestock, implements, fertilizers, and similar factors. Some of those w ill be produced on the farms and units of the department and sold to the cultivators. Items which cannot be produced within the country, such as chemical fertilizers, seeds, and insecticides, will be imported. Training Middle grade technicians are being trained at the Agriculture School. They are trained to assist the cultivators in making the best use of available resources. A t present, the trainers are given diplomas in agriculture and home sciences. There are also short-term training facilities for field men, field assistants, etc. During the Second Plan 680 were trained. Most of the high level technicians required in Nepal— doctors, engineers, and agriculture specialists— receive their training in India. Some 10-15 agriculture technicians are returning from India every year. With the expansion of agricultural activities, high level manpower requirements will also increase. To meet the targets set forth in the Plan, 250 advanced (graduate) and 1,400 middle grades (JTA) technicians will be required. In view of the increased demand, 50 persons will be sent to India and abroad for technical training during the Plan period the middle grade technicians will be trained locally. An agriculture College will be established during the Plan period. Agricultural Extension Agricultural production will not increase unless improved techniques are adopted by the cultivators. This will not be possible unless a link is established between the experimental stations and the cultivators. Contact between these two groups is maintained through agricultural extension. Under this programme, middle grade technicians go into the field and demonstrate various improved techniques to the cultivators. When problems arise, those technicians ask the relevant technical section for advice. At present there are 120 agronomy JTAs; nine Home Science JTAs and 29 other JTAs who are responsible for extension activities in the various districts. These technicians work under the guidance of the district panchayats. To provide technical assistance to these JTA, one agricultural extension officer is stationed in each zone. Unless the various factors of production such as improved seeds, fertilizer, insecticides are available, times and places at a reasonable price, supply centres will be established in various areas. Extension services will cover 900,000 hectares during the Plan period. Agriculture extension to date has not been very successful because of the lack of transport facilities, technicians, and coordination with other developmental programmes, improved seeds, fertilizer, credit and efficient administration. Necessary steps will be taken to overcome these difficulties. Agricultural Economics and Statistics The purpose of this programme is to collect agricultural and related data and to study the potential of agricultural industries. This programme will also study and analyze land use, crop production, livestock use, weather conditions, prices of agricultural products, marketing systems, the village economy, cultivation techniques etc. Grading of agricultural products and quality control will also be started. Although, agriculture in a vital part of the economy, there is inadequate data on agriculture at present. To undertake effective programmes, much more data is needed. Efforts will be made together as much data as possible. Resettlement Programme Since the non -agricultural sectors of the economy are still undeveloped, increases in population must be at least partially absorbed in agriculture. Population pressure on land is severe in the hill regions. It is less serious in the Terai since there are still cultivable lands available. People have been moving out of the Terai. They clear the jungles and settle wherever they can. Often these people move from one place to another, clearing a different area of the jungle leach time. This kind of unorganized clearing and cultivation reduces the forest resources of the country. Progress made up to the present time The first organized resettlement programme was started by His Majesty’s Government in the Rapti Valley during the First Plan. Under this programme, 10,000 hectares of land were distributed for the settlement of 5,000 families. Other facilities such as schools, hospitals and market areas were also made available. During the Second Plan, additional families were resettled. In the Nawalpur project in Lumbini zone 700 families were resettled on 1,850 hectares. Programme under the Third Plan During the Third Plan, population is expected to increase at the r ate of 150 thousand annually. Of this, ninety-five thousand will occur in the hill regions. This will place even greater pressures upon cultivable land in the hills. To help reduce, the pressure, 6,000 families will be resettled on 13, 900 hectares of land in Banke, Bardia, and Kailali Kanchanpur and Udaipur districts during the Plan period. Land Reform and Land Administration The objectives of the Land Reform programme in Nepal are to ensure a fair share of the fruits of his production to the cultivators by putting an end to exploitation, and to encourage labour and capital to shift from agriculture to other sectors. These objectives are not limited to an equitable distribution of present production alone. The cultivators will be given greater incentive to increase production. This encouragement will be in the form of tenancy rights, low cost credit and the opportunity to retain the profits of their increased effort. The land Reform Act of 1958 and the Birta Abolition Act of 1960 Land Reform legislation was first passed in 1958. The Act called for fixing maximum rent at 50 per cent of the yield, imposing a ceiling of interest rates at 10 per cent, eliminating forced labour, and providing security of tenure for those who had tilled a given piece of land for more than a year. This Act could not be effectively implemented because of the absence of adequate records of land ownership; no sources of the credit other than the landlords and merchants; an d, above all, the absence of efficient land administration. The Birts Abolition Act of 1960 and the Estates Abolition Act of 1963 also deserve mention. Despite these measures the condition of the cultivator did not improve. Lack of tenancy records, the limited number of cooperative societies, and the slow progress of the cadastral survey were some of the barriers. The specific objectives of the present Land Reform programme are: to prepare full records of tenancy, to provide alternative sources of credit to expedite the progress of the cadastral survey work and to establish an efficient and modern system of land administration. Although, a majority of the people in Nepal own some land, much is owned by relatively few people. This fact has direct bearing upon agricultural production, particularly in the Terai region. The final impact of the evils of the existing land system is upon the peasant. Though the function of the Zamindari system was to help the government collect land revenue, it because a means of exploitation. Therefore, the abolition of the Zamindari system is essential to Nepal’s development. The Land Reform Act of 1964 A new land reform measure was enacted in 1964, which is of major importance from the economic and social points of view. Rights of both landlords and tenants have been secured by this Act. The salient features of the Act are: 7. A compulsory saving program to provide an alternative source of credit, and the interception of loan repayments to private lenders. Progress to Date A considerable period of time is necessary to implement the above listed provisions on a national scale. The Land Reform Programme had been implemented in 16 development districts1by the end of t he Second Plan. The programme will cover the rest of Nepal in the first few years of the Third Plan. In nine of the 16 districts in which work was undertaken during the Second Plan, cadastral survey work was carried on together with the identification of tenants and the distribution of provisional certificates of tenancy. These provisional certificates will be replaced by the issuance of permanent certificates at a later date. Other phases of the programme — fixing rent, collecting data on production, preparing tenancy records, recording debts, collecting compulsory savings deposits, intercepting debt repayments and acquiring land in excess of the legal ceiling or holdings— are also underway. To date, the cadastral survey has covered 57,333 hectares of land is 250 Village Panchayats. Records for 182,000 tenants have been issued to 64,500 tenants. In seven districts, activities such as the preparation of debt records, tenancy holdings, compulsory savings collection, and the organization of ward commit tees for the interception of loan repayments are in full swing. Savings in kind have amounted to 31,481.17 metric tons and in cash to Rs 850,000. Records have been complied for more than 300,000 contributors. The loans advanced by these committees to the peasants have amounted to Rs 85,000 and 851.22 metric tons in cash and in kind respectively. Difficulties Faced by the Programme The preparation of land records and the identification of tenants are progressing satisfactorily. This achievement can be ascribed to the existence of special courts. However, the forced eviction of tenants from land in some of the districts has become a major problem. Delay in cadastral survey work is another obstacle to the progress of the Land Reform programme. The cadastral survey work, which will be discussed later, should be separated from the Land Reform Programme. The Compulsory Saving Scheme is progressing satisfactorily. The realization of debt repayments from the cultivators is not satisfactory. It may be attributable to the fact that this work was started after the harvest season. The Land Reform Programme under the Third Plan The Land Reform Programme will be completed in the early years of the Plan. Tenancy rights will be secured and an alternative system of credit will be established. The cadastral survey work, redistribution of excess holding, establishment of land of land administration, permanent credit facilities and agriculture development world will be continued through the Plan period. Since one goal of the programme is no improve the economic condition of the cultivator by giving him land ownership, efforts will be made to realize this goal in the Third Plan period. Cadastral survey work on all cultivated land and the creation of an efficient and modern land administration system is of special importance. Cadastral Survey Land revenue assessment in Nepal is based upon many factors. The quality of seed used on the land, the area of land that can be ploughed by a pair of oxen in a day, the area of land that can be dug by spades in a day, and chain measurement are some of the bases for assessment. The present records are not accurate since 1The 16 development districts are Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kabhre Palanchowk, Sindhu Palanchowk, Nuwakot, Dhading, Rasuwa, Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Bardia, Kailali, Jhapa, Chitawan and Makawanpur. they do not correspond to data secured by actual measurement. The need for an accurate cadastral survey is apparent. Its main purpose is to determine the boundaries of the land and to classify the land properly. Cadastral survey work in Nepal was started before 1923 but no maps were prepared on the basis of the surveys. From 1938 to 19478, six districts were surveyed using the plain table method. During the First Plan period, only 434,000 hectares of land were surveyed and 134,400 hectares registered. During the Second Plan, maps were prepared for 365,200 hectares, 512,400 hectares were registered and land records were prepared for 490,400 hectares. The Plan target was 801,717 hectares of land. The progress of the cadastral survey work has been slower than anticipated and the methods are technically unsatisfactory. Adequate data regarding tenancy was not collected accepts for that part of the cadastral survey work conducted under the Land Reform programme. An additional 799,880 hectares of land will be survey during the Third Plan. Additional surveyors will bee trained during the plan period. Land Administration The data collected under the cadastral survey programme will reveal the amount of land on which land revenue payments are less than full assessment or are not recorded at all. This will provide a sound basis for increasing revenue together with the establishment of an efficient land administration unit. The need for such a unit is also clear form the fact that the administration of land should be coordinated with the land reform programme. Resettlement on newly reclaimed land is also necessary. In view of these considerations, His Majesty’s Government has decided to establish a separate department of land administration. The activities of this department will be initially limited to those districts where the land reform programme is underway. Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Development Credit facilities have an important role ion the development of agriculture. The Present agricultural system cannot be improved without credit. There are various kinds of credit required in Nepal. Short term credit up to one year is needed to provide the farmers with improved seeds, fertilizers, and small tools and for payment to labour hired for planting and harvesting. Medium term credit for three to five years is needed to finance tube wells, land clearing and large implements. Long term credit is required to develop new lands and to buy farm machinery. Only short and medium term credit can be provided under the present system. The government has provided long term credit for settlement of new lands. However, there is no established system of providing such credit. Landlords and merchants are the main sources of credit. Credit given by these private sources becomes a means of exploitation. At present the development of cooperatives is in its initial stage in Nepal. The amount of credit provided by the cooperatives is small because of the difficulties of administration and loan processing. One of the objectives of the Land Reform programme is to make credit available at reasonable interest rates. Development of Cooperatives Cooperatives have an important role to play by bringing together small cultivators with their limited resources. The financial condition of most cultivators is very poor. Their position is worsened by the interest rates and other condition imposed by private credit sources. The experience of other developing countries indicates that plentiful credit at reasonable interest rate stimulates development. This can be major contribution of the cooperatives. Therefore, the agriculture system will be developed through cooperative organizations. They will make credit available at reasonable rates of interest. In the Rapti Valley resettlement program, landless cultivators were given credit through cooperatives. A total of 1109 cooperative societies, cottage industry and consumer cooperatives, two Districts consumer institutions and 14 district-level marketing and credit cooperatives were established during the last three years. Program for the Third Plan There are various reasons fo r the slow progress of cooperative development to date. Most of the farmers are illiterate and poor. Under these conditions it is difficult to develop administrative skill necessary for the development of cooperatives. Again, if the societies are limited only to credit, they cannot provide full benefit to the cultivators. Therefore, expanded field work and the establishment of production and marketing societies are necessary. Three hundred fifty large multipurpose cooperatives will be established during the Third Plan. These will not be limited to credit but will also be marketing and supply units as well and encourage cottage industry development and undertake management of god owns. These institutions will be organized in those districts where land reform work is underway. Efforts will be made to develop experimental cooperative in the agricultural sector. For this purpose, ten agricultural cooperatives with a total of at least 1,000 families will be organized. In addition, ten consumer institutions in urban areas 75 industrial cooperatives will be established. Emphasis will be given to paper, metal working, carpets, textiles, ceramics, nickel-plating, soap, curios, carpentry, furniture, and fruit canning activities for the industrial units. In total, 545 new cooperatives will be organized. A total of 30 cooperative federations will be established at the district level to provide management assistance and to coordinate the activities of the primary institutions. A national Federation will be organized with the district units as members. Coordination with the Land Reform Programme A multipurpose cooperative will be established in each village panchayat where full implementation of the Land Reform has taken place. Resources to assist these multipurpose institutions will be provided. These institutions will be supervised by a committee with representatives from each ward. The cooperatives will assess the members, prepare agricultural development plans, collect savings, supply consumer goods and manage god owns. As the primary institutions are the cooperative movement, efforts will be made to solve the problems faced by these units and to meet their financial needs. Government activity in this field will be conducted through these institutions. Cooperative Organization A nationwide cooperative federation will be organized. It will prepare and implement a coordinate programme of cooperative activities. District cooperative federation will be established and will be members of the national federation. Village panchayat cooperatives will, in turn, be members of the district federations. The district units will provide funds for credit purposes and assist in marketing agricultural products. Training Trained personnel are needed for efficient operation of the cooperatives. In the absence of such personnel, cooperative development will suffer. Development staff and higher society officials will be trained. Short term training will be given to cooperative auditors and sub-inspectors. The managers of the village panchayat cooperatives, supply and marketing supervisors, ward supervisors and supply officers will also be trained. Banking Facilities The present Cooperative Bank will supply loans to the farmers through the cooperative institutions. This bank was established in 1963. It has a major role in providing necessary credit for the development of cooperatives and the successful implementation of the Land Reform programme. It presently has more than Rs 2.9 million of paid up capital. Eleven godowns at Jhapa, Nepaljung and Biratnagar have been constructed with the assistance of the bank. The godowns have a total capacity of 8,000 mounds. Loans totaling Rs 100,000 were made available for the resettlement program at Nawalpur. Short term loans have been made available to buy improved wheat seed. Credit facilities will be made available only to those areas where the land reform programme has been effectively implemented. The Bank will also handle the compulsory savings under the land reform programme and credit requirements for land resettlement schemes. It will also assist cottage industry development. The Cooperative Bank will make loans to cooperative societies. Various difficulties facing cooperative development were mentioned earlier. Agricultural development cannot depend on solely cooperative credit. There is no provision to meet the credit needs of agricultural industries which are of major importance to rural development. These include dairying, sheep grazing, etc. During the Third Plan, an agricultural bank will be established to provide credit for the development of commercial agriculture. CHAPTER X Food Grains The Agriculture Census of 1961-62 indicated that 2,011,664 metric tons of food grain (paddy), wheat, maize, millet etc. were produced in Nepal. As the average annual consumption in Kathmandu Valley and the Terai is 197 kilograms and in the hill area 180 kilogram, total requirements come to 1,754,064 metric tons. The surplus food grains amounting to 257,600 metric tons are exported. Although there is an overall surplus of food grain production in Nepal, some areas of the country, particularly Kathmandu Valley and the hill areas, have a deficit. Because of lack of transportation facilities, it is difficult to transport food grain from the Terai to the hills. The surplus production of the Terai is exported southward. If more storage facilities are provided in both surplus and deficit districts, more will be improved into the deficit areas. In the absence of godowns, the rice and paddy are exported right after they are harvested. Food grains are imported later to meet the requirements of the people. The following programmes are included in the Third Plan. Godown Construction The paddy production of the country is 2,200,000 metric tons, in 1964-65 out of which the Terai produces 1,500,000 metric tons. The surplus in this area should be used to supply the deficit hill areas. The surplus can be exported at higher prices. Therefore, His Majesty’s Government has given priority to the construction of godowns during the period. The processing capacity of the rice mills in Nepal is 1,000,000 metric tons of rice from 1,500,000 tons of paddy. Godowns with a total capacity of 21,575 metric tons have been completed in 12 districts during the Second Plan period. An additional 43,775 metric tons of capacity will be constructed in the hill regions during this plan period. During the first year, 19 godowns, with capacities varying from 75 to 500 metric tons will be built in 13 districts. These will have a total storage capacity of 6,850 tons. In the second year 27 godowns will be constructed in 23 different districts with total storage capacity of 6,850 metric tons. In the third year 11 godowns with a total of 6,000 metric tons will be built during the fourth year. Five godowns with a storage capacity of 2,500 metric tons will be built in four districts. With the completion of these godowns, market prices of food grains can be stabilized since buffer stocks can be maintained. Food Grain Marketing Food Research The construction of food laboratory will be started during this plan period. Data will be collected on rice milling operations. The possibility of developing a fruit canning and processing industry will be studied. Forests and wild animals are among the important natural resources of Nepal. The major benefits to be accrued from forest are not only soil protection, timber and fuel by also raw materials for local industrial use and for export. Therefore, forest must be carefully planned and managed. Progress in the Second Plan Some of the important forest development achievement during the Second Plan were: Construction of 3840 kilometers of forest demarcation lines in nine hill divisions and thirteen Terai divisions; 448 kilometers of fire lines; 480 kilometers of forest trails; and reforestation on 2,454 hectares in Kathmandu, Trisuli, Chautara, Ilam, Pokhara, Salyan and Lumbini areas. In additionm a survey has been conducted to determine the forest wealth of the country and to create a sound base for forest exploitation. Wild life refuges have been established at Chitwan, Kanchapur and Biratnagar. Under training programme one hundred and twelve rangers and 214 foresters have been trained. Third Plan This wills facilities national forest products utilization in the future. Demarcations: The forest boundary demarcation work started to check the misuse of forest and to develop forest resources along scientific line will be continued. As additional 4,000 kilometers of forest demarcation lines will be constructed during the Plan. This will consist of 2400 kilometers in nine hill divisions and 1,600 kilometers in 14 Terai divisions. Fire Production: Four hundred and eighty kilometers miles of fire lines under 16 divisions will be constructed during the Plan to reduce the damage done by fires. During the dry season a team of ten forest guards will be assigned to each division to provide fire protection. Forest Road Construction: Forest roads are essential for forest protection and also transporting the forest products. Moreover, such roads will be constructed in this plan period and steps will be taken to maintain the existing ones. Bridges, culverts and drains will be constructed wherever necessary. During the Plan period, a total of 1200 kilometers of fair weather road will be built. Afforestation: Afforestation programme has been launched in those areas where forests are destroyed annually. Additional 10,121 hectares of land will be afforestated and turned “trail plots” will be established in the Plan period. Wild Life Protection: As present two wild life refuges are under construction to product wild life, particularly the relenocorous. Two more will be constructed during the Plan period. Arrangement will be made establish national parks in protected areas. Soil Protection: In many parts of the Hill region, fertile soil is washed away by water. Reforestation programmes to control soil erosion will be undertaken in select areas. Silviculture: So far no attention has been paid to this matter. Work on the silvicultural treatment of forests will be started. This involves creeper cutting, thinning, felling improvement, removal of unwanted species, and weeding. Forest research work will be undertaken to gather more knowledge of forest resources for the utilization and its development. Forest Research: During the Third Plan three research stations will be established; one each in the Hills, Inner Terai and Teri. Experimental work will be undertaken on different species. The stations will also study soil conditions and forest insects in cooperation with the Agriculture Department. Forest Extension: Many village people of Nepal earn living from the use of neighboring forest areas. To avoid forest depletion, to stimulate village interest protection, and to educate the people on modern tree plantations, a forestry extension programme will be undertaken during the Plan. The requirement of more trained technician is being felt for the protection, exploitation and development of forest resources. The FRI will increase its existing capacity to train more forest experts. Training: Every year 35 rangers and 70 forests will be trained at the center in Hetauda. In addition, short term training will be given to existing staff. Miscellaneous: The organization and administration of the Forestry Department will be improved and strengthened. Building will be constructed to meet the requirements of the department. Botany The major objective of the Botany Department is to utilize the country’s medicinal herbs and to create a base for the establishment of pharmaceutical industries. A Botanical Department was established for the utilization and development of the herbs and medicinal plants in Nepal. Medicinal plants will be grown on the herbal farms and necessary processing will be undertaken at the laboratory. Farmers will be provided financial and technical assistance to encourage them to grow medicinal plants. Due attention will be paid for the development of this sector in order to strength the economy. Satisfactory progress has been made in the past few years in pharmaceutical development. The Royal Research Laboratory has been established to analyze and conduct experiments on various drugs. Two regional laboratories have been set up at Nepalgunj and Hetauda. In addition seven herbal farms in different climatic regions (Shreepur, Manichuda, Dhunge, Tistung, Daman, Dharan and Hetuda) have been established. Two herbal trading centres at Kathmandu and Nepalgunj have been opened to market processed herbs. During the Second period botanical survey work was undertaken in Kavre Palanchwok, Ramecchap, Okhaldhunga and Bhojpur. In the West the Baglung, Kutinath, Mustang, Jumla, Doti, and Baitadi areas were covered. A survey has been completed in Bardia, in the Terai and in Chisapani Gadi, in Bagmti zone. A botanical garden has been established in Godavari for the protection and demonstration of various plants, compilation and preparation of herberian sheets are being carried out. Third Plan The botanical survey and other development work undertaken in the Second Plan period have created a base for the future programme. During the Third Plan the following activities will be carried forward: Royal Drug Research Laboratory: The activities of the Research Laboratory will be expanded to include experimentation on various drugs. Production of various medicines and useful oils will be undertaken on an experimental basis from the herbs found in Nepal. Three new regional laboratories will be established during this Plan period. Herbal Farms: Measures will be taken to improve the present seven herbal farms and the work of propagating both native and foreign herbs will be continued. In addition five new herbal farms will be established in different climatic regions. During the Plan 5,000 additional acres will be brought under herbal farming. Botanical Survey: The botanical survey, conducted in a few selected areas at present, will be extended to cover the entire country by the end of the Plan period. Information collected by the botanical survey wills republish. Herbal Trading Centres: The work of the Kathmandu and Nepalgunj trading centres has been satisfactory. Five other trading centres will be opened in the Terai during the Plan period. Besides providing incentives to herb growers, technical assistance will be provided to them by such centres. Royal Botanical Gardens: Improvements will be made in the Royal Botanical Garden in Godavari. Incentive to the Herbal Industries: Simple botanical survey and research work is not sufficient to exploit the herbal resources of the country. Maximum benefits can be derived only from the utilization of knowledge acquired from the survey and research work. During the plan period necessary technical assistance will be provided to investors to open up new industries utilizing medical herbs or plants. CHAPTER XII Irrigation A substantial increase in the productivity of the soil is essential to meet the needs of the people The 10 million Nepalese people depend upon the produce of 2.3 million hectares of land. To make a significant increase in productivity, introduction of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers in essential, but the expansion of irrigation facilities is equally important. Nepal has been endowed with abundant hydrological resources. The Kosi, Karnali, Gandaki and other rivers provide a continuous flow of water. When the potential of these rivers is fully realized the quantity of drinking water, irrigation and power available in Nepal will multiply many times over. Present Utilization It is estimated theta boot 25,101 hectares of land were under irrigation prior to the First Plan period. In the fiscal year 1961-62 an additional 26,397 hectares of land were brought under irrigation to make a total of 51,417 hectares land irrigation before the Second Plan. The target of the Second Plan was to irrigate another 57,287 hectares of land. Two third of the target was achieved by the end of the Plan period. The achievements by the end of the Second Plan period are shown in Table 19. Construction of the western Canal of the Kamala River Project and the Khageri Project at Rapti are in process. Preliminary work of the Mohana Canal has also been started. Among the surveys undertaken during the Second Plan were (1) the further survey of the Kanchan, Danabs, Banganga and Bagmti Canal projects; (2) the partial survey of the Babai and Kankai projects and (3) preliminary survey of the Sonkosi by the UN special Fund. The Third Plan The five projects started during the Second Plan will be completed during the Third Plan. The Bihul (Spatari) Project was not undertaken because of a lack of information on flow volume. The surveys of the Khatti (Sapatri), Santollar (Palpa), Chope Nahar (Okhldhunga) and Banepa projects were postponed because of technical and technical and transport difficulties. Total irrigated land represents that portion which can actually be irrigated. Targets in the Third Plan Emphasis has been laid on irrigation programme to increase agricultural production during the Third Plan period. The growing population demands higher agricultural output from Terai and irrigation opens an important avenue to reach those goals. During the Third Plan the following projects will be completed: Kamala: Construction of the Kamala Bansje in Dhunkuta district will be completed, bringing new irrigation facilities to 25,506 hectares of land. This project will irrigate 50 per cent of the land in Dhunkuta and Saptari districts. Khagari: This project which is already underway is the first step in irrigating the Rapti Valley, covering 6,070 hectares of land in Chitawan. Tinau East Canal: The Tinau East Canal, built north-east of Bhairahawa, is expected to bring about 5,263 hectares of land under irrigation. Banganga: The Danaganga canal of Taulihawa will irrigate 8,100 hectares of land in Kapilvastu district. Mohana: About 8910 hectares of land in Dhangadhi district will be brought under irrigation by the completion of this project. Bagmati: All the middle portion of Lands not covered by Kamala and Gandak projects will be irrigated by the Bagmati project. This covers 81,000 hectares of land on Rautahat, Bara and Sarlahi districts. The Construction of these projects will be started during the Third Plan period and completed during the Fourth Plan. Gandak: This Project, which is under construction by the Indian Government, is expected to irrigate 65,700 hectares of land in Bara, Parsa and Rautahat district. Chatra: The Chatara canal project is under construction as a part of the Kosi Project…. The Project will irrigate 60,150 hectares of land in Sunsari and Morang district. Other Projects: This covers the medium-size projects to be constructed in the Hill and Terai areas. As these areas are under survey, details of construction will be worked out after the surveys are completed. These projects will irrigate a total of 4,049 hectares of land. Minor Projects: Projects not involving more than Rs 100,000 will be constructed in the Terai and Hill regions according to requirements. Hydrological Survey: A hydrological survey will be conducted throughout the country. Pre-investment Survey The Irrigation Projects depend on prior surveys. Such surveys are of two types: (1) Reconnaissance and (2) Pre-investment. The reconnaissance survey estimated the potential hydrological development. Reconnaissance surveys have been completed in most of the Terai areas during the Second Plan period. Similar surveys will be completed in the mid-western and hill regions by the end of the Third Plan period. Upon the completion of such surveys hydrological development works will be projected for the country. Pre-investment surveys provide knowledge on the economic and technical potentialities of the development works. They include topography survey, geological research of dam sites, collection of hydrological data, and surveys of areas to be irrigated and their cropping patterns. A broad outline of proposed project is prepared on the basis of these results and development costs are estimated. Pre-investment surveys will be conducted in the Sunkosi, Kankai, Babai and Rapti River basins during the Third Plan period. Utilization of Irrigation Facilities Available irrigation facilities in Nepal are not being fully utilized. The growing demands of agricultural production call for maximum utilization of existing irrigation facilities. Assistance will be given to the cultivators to achieve maximum utilization of water resources and will be improved to check the misuse of water. Irrigation facilities can provide benefits to the nation in two ways: first, they add to national production, and second irrigation fees directly increase national revenue. Compared with increases in agricultural production, irrigation fees are relatively minor; they are a source of revenue which must be collected to ensure equitability in benefits from irrigation. The main reason that revenue has been less than the anticipated is that there are no accurate records of land ownership. The cadastral survey is incomplete in most areas. The land records of Mal Addas cannot be used for revenue purposes because they are not prepared on a geographical basis. Dramatic increase in revenues derived from irrigated land can be expected after the land record system is reformed and maintained in a scientific way under the Land Reform Program. The records prepared for tax purposes will be submitted to the district land office. It will be the responsibility of the district administration to maintain proper records and collect land and water taxes. Compared with other countries, Nepal water rate, which comes to about Rs 1.61 per hectare is very low. It is not enough to meet annual maintenance costs. These consideration points to the necessity of an upward revision of irrigation fees. CHAPTER XIII Panchayat The Panchayat system is not only a form of political organization but also a most suitable and usefu l medium for the over-all development of the country. His Majesty’s Government has set itself the task of developing the nation by utilizing effectively the available manpower and other sources under the Panchayat system. Only then can a dynamic society be established which will mobilize the energies and the resources of the people of Nepal for development purpose in an orderly manner. During the Second Plan period various development activities were undertaken at all levels: national, district and village. However, it cannot be said that the panchayat organizations at each level were fully utilized. Attempts were made to involve people directly in local administration and to mobilize resources for local development activities. But the progress was not satisfactory. An effective decentralization programme can not be achieved with just by passing laws regarding decentralization. This must be carefully planned to make the programme a successful and monetary assistance provide district and village panchayats by the central government helped them to perform their routine work were effectively. But such measures left unsolved the relationship between central departments and the district and village panchayats. However, the experience of the Three Year Plan period has been of considerable value in shaping plans, particularly when considered in the light of the report submitted by the Decentralization Commission formed two years age by His Majesty. Objectives of the Third Plan Broad on past experience and present requirements, the Third Plan aims at the development of Panchayats at various levels for the national construction in accordance with the principle of decentralization. However, no objectives can generally be achieved simply creating a system. Success of the system largely depends on the general population and their cooperation. The panchayat system and its decentralization programme cannot succeed simply by depending on the initiative and leadership of the elected panchas. It demands the cooperation of the general public. The rate of development of any country under any type of administrative. It is true that the appropriate system can easily encourage the awakened society to march ahead. Hence the foremost objectives of the Third Plan in the process of panchayat development is to reorient traditional thinking patterns and promote self-reliance, and create a sense of cooperation to achieve the goals of national development. Decentralization The Panchayat system established by His Majesty is not only a suitable political system but also an important medium of mobilizing the resources and successfully implementing the plan. In accordance with the desire of His Majesty, each and every able citizen of the country must have an opportunity to participate in planning various development activities at all panchayat levels. The success of this system will largely depend on the implementation of the decentralization principle. As long as the panchayats at various levels are not given the authority and responsibility to undertake their own development works, these paanchayats will not serve effectively as a medium of economic development. Therefore, His Majesty’s Government is committed to the task of decentralizing the powers to the panchayats for maximum benefit to the nation. However, the real intent of decentralization may not be achieved simply by delegating authority to the panchayats. The steps must be taken up in an organized and planned manner. In addition to the authority and responsibility given to the panchayats, financial resources must be made available to carry out the development activities. This also calls for training facilities and technical personnel to assist the organization in their new efforts. Implementation of decentralization throughout the kingdom at one time is impossible. Moreover, it is not possible for the central government to pay attention to all levels of the panchayat system at one time. Therefore, an orderly process of decentralization is imperative. Details of the process are given in the Plan Implementation Chapter. It must be mentioned here that the decentralization programme will start first at the district level. The permanent phase of decentralization needs some pre-conditions created and this takes time to achieve. So the decentralization programme has been divided into three successive phases. After the completion of all three phases, all 75 district panchayats of the country will bear considerable administrative responsibility regarding land administration, agriculture, communications, education, health and other development activities. Training The success of the decentralization programme depends largely upon trained personnel. Arrangements will be made to provide training facilities to the official of district and village panchayats. Training will also be provided to selected pancha s and village leaders to make them conscious of their duty and new responsibilities. But the most important task is to form a nucleus team and give them training regarding development programmes to be carried forward in the district. Arrangements will be made to provide two types of training to meet the requirements mentioned above. The first type of training will be given to the officials to be appointed at the district and village level to look after the education, health, postal and other services. A great number of officials will be required at village and district levels to make the Third Plan a success. Some of the official who is already at work also needs training to be more effective. As all the officials cannot be trained at one place 14 training centres will be established in the 14 zones within the next decade. During the Third Plan period, five such centres will be opened. Available resources, including instructors, do not permit establishment of all 14 training centres over the next five years. During the Third Plan, these zonal training centres will train district and village panchayat officials in administration, cooperative organization, education, health, agriculture and other activities The second type of training by such zonal training centres will be provided village leaders and other people. Potential Leaders of class organizations, existing officials of village and district panchayats and others, will receive training regarding the duties and responsibilities of every citizen in the development of the nation. Training facilities should be providing to the class organization workers to enable them to help the people to achieve the goals of decentralization. In total such training will be provided to 9000 individuals from different zones. In addition to the type of training mentioned above, arrangements will be made to hold training session from time to time in remote area of the country to help the people in their day today activities. Such training sessions will be for both men and women and the period of training will vary two weeks to two months. Grants in Aid One of the chief objectives of the decentralization programme is to mobilize local resources for local development work and to use the resources of the central government for purpose of national significance. Therefore, most of the local needs will be met by the resources of village and district panchayats after the completion of all three phases of the decentralization programme. Therefore, the central government will provide only limited financial assistance to selective purpose. It will take time, however, to decentralization for general administrative and local development costs. Financial help will also be provided to build panchayat buildings. CHAPTER XIV Industry The rate of economic development of any nation is related to the expansion of industrial activities. Industry not only provides employment, but also increases productively and national income by utilizing of available resources. Additional markets for agricultural products are also created. Thus industrial development and the expansion of agriculture are complement to one another. Nepal does not have a long history of industrial development. A few small industries were begun during World War II, but most of them did not survive because of technical and operational difficulties. Much emphasis was given during the First and Second Plan to establish the preconditions for industrial development. Communications were expanded and transport and power facilities were improved. The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) was founded with a view to providing financial and technical assistance to the private sector. Financial support totaling Rs 543,000 was extended by NIDC during the First Plan period and Rs 31,600,000 during the Second Plan. At Balaju Industrial Estate, 13 building have been constructed and six firms have begun production. At Patan Industrial Estate 20 buildings have been constructed and firms have begun production. Construction of the Hetauda Industrial Estate has begun. A number of other factories have been established during the First and Second Plan. Public sector industries— e.g. sugar, cigarette, leather and shoe constructed with the assistance of friendly nations have started production. Many units in the sugar, textile, biscuit, woolen textile, leather straw board, carpet, pharmaceutics and re -rolling fields are being set up in the private sector. The capacity of existing plants producing rice, oil and other products have been increased and steps are being taken to increase the capacity of other e.g. the tourist industry is being stimulated by new hotel construction. Policies and Priorities Under the Third Plan The industrial policy of encouraging and providing maximum facilities to provide sector industries will be continued. Special consideration will be given to increase the productive capacity of existing plants under the industrial development programme. Emphasis will be given export promotion in order to earn foreign currency so that the capital goods needed for industrial growth can be purchased. To ensure maximum utilization of limited resources, the order of priorities will be as follows: First, preference will be given to such industries as lumber and plywood, paper, sugar, cement, lime and mica. Production of these goods will reduce imports and utilize few materials available in the country. Fifth, basic industries such as fertilizer, agricultural implements and tools, etc., will be given consideration, although greater emphasis will be given these in subsequent plans. New Industrial Units The Brick and Tile and Agricultural tool factories to be built in the public sector will start production during the Third Plan period. Cement, lime and mica factories are also to be established in the public sector. Jute: The Jute industry of Nepal, a major foreign currency earner, now has an annual production capacity of 15,000 metric tons. This capacity will be doubled during the Third Plan. Anew jute kill will be constructed at Bhadrapur, once the Mechi Bridge is constructed as a p art the East-West Highway. Sugar: To meet the increasing demand of sugar and additional 215,000 metric tons of sugar will be produced annually to give a total annual production of 43,000 metric tons. Cement: A cement factory will be established at Hetauda with a production capacity of 60,000 metric tons. Construction of the mill, largely with private capital, is expected during the Third Plan. Distillery: One alcohol plant will be installed utilizing the by-product, molasses, from the sugar at Birgunj. Rice and Flour Mills: Mills with a total production capacity of 10,000 metric tons will be established at Hetauda and Kathmandu. Plywood: Plywood factories with a total capacity of 15 million square feet per year will be established in Biratnagar, Hetauda and Dhangadi. Solvent: A solvent extract factory of 30,000 metric tons annual capacity will be established in Nepalgunj utilizing the by-products of rice mills. Brewery: A brewery on 1,136,000 liter annual capacity will be constructed either in Nepalgunj, Hetauda or Katmnandu. The target is to product 23,000 metric tons of soap per year. Cold Storage: A cold storage plant of 3,000 metric tons capacity will be installed during the Plan, probably in Kathmandu. Paint and Varnish: A paint and varnish factory of 1,000 metric tons annual capacity will be established in Hetauda. Cotton Textiles: During the Third Plan, two cotton textile factories with a capacity of 18 million meters will be constructed to meet the domestic requirements for cotton cloth. Woolen Textiles: The output of woolen textiles mills is expected to reach 228,000 meters by the end of the Third Plan. Industrial Surveys Pre-investment surveys and the study of market potentials are necessary preconditions for industrial growth. During the Second Plan period, surveys were conducted by NIDC regarding the potential for producing products such as tea, plywood, paper. 1. Sodas ash and chlorine 2. Alcohol 3. Paper 4. Starch and dextrose 5. Lime and cement 6. Glass and ceramics 7. Nitrogenous fertilizer 8. Iron and steel 9. Industrial development states. Industrial Estates Additional industrial estates will be established in selected areas to facilities industrial expansion. After detailed study of the availability of power, transport and communication facilities, five new industrial estates will be installed during the Third Plan period in the following locations: Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Since its inception in 1959, The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation has been fostering plan development. It has helped revitalize many antiquated industries and provided financial and technical assistance in establishing new industrial units. Moreover, it has encouraged industrial research and planning and provided managerial training to many Nepalese. In the Third Plan, however, these subsidiary activities will be conducted by an Industrial promotion and Productivity Center, to be set up as a subsidiary part of the Corporation. Financial support provided to private industry by NIDC during the Second Plan period is shown in Table 22. During the Third Plan, the activities of NIDC will be expanded to provide maximum technical and financial assistance to private businessmen . Private businessmen have agreed to invest Rs 20,500,000 in addition to Rs 20,940,000 made by NIDC during the Second Plan period. In addition to the investment made to encourage private businessmen NIDC has also invested Ts. 5,124,320 in the Balaju and Hetauda industrial estates. Organizational Changes and Training Necessary steps will be taken to improve the organization and operation of existing and newly created industries in the public sector so that maximum efficiency may be achieved. Feasibility and pre-investment studies will be conducted with considerable care in connection with proposals for new industries of the expansion of those now in existence. Both the short and long term requirements of industrial growth must be recognized. Trained and experienced personnel are required in both public and private industry and these requirements will increase many- fold in the years ahead. Therefore, training facilities will be expanded substantially during the Third Plan. As already noted, the training program of NIDC will be given increased emphasis. Cottage and Small Scale Industries A large section of the peasant population is occupied in farming for only a few months of the years. Cottage industry can provide the farmers with employment and income during of off-season. Hand woven textiles, straw baskets, canned food, brass containers and souvenirs for tourists are some of the items that can be produced on a cottage industry basis in Nepal. Competitions from large scale machine methods of production are keen. But if care is used in establishing cottage industries where the market prospects are good and under circumstances in which both the capital outlay and the opportunity cost of labour are low, this method of production can be a profitable undertaking. Progress in the Second Plan During the Second Plan period, 1800 people received training in cottage industry methods and techniques. This training was provided by the Cottage Industries Training Centre in Kathmandu and by the various training centers established in the zones. Due to lack of capital and administrative and organizational difficulties, not all of the trainees found employment. Under circumstances which would permit those to utilize the skills acquired. As a consequence, it is clear that the Cottage Industry Programme fell short of its goals. Objectives in the Third Plan Under the Third Plan, the Objectives will be as follows: Programme in the Third Plan To achieve the above objectives, the following programmes will be undertaken: Training: Necessary changes will be made in the training programme to bring it into line with the requirements of the above objectives. For example, if improved methods of production are developed, the training programme will be altered accordingly. Extension: The extension programme will be made more effective and practical. Under this pragramme, arrangements will be made to provide training in new techniques of production and to provide necessary technical advice to craftsmen. Attentions will be given to developing sources of raw material at reasonable prices. Exhibition will be held to demonstrate new products and production techniques. Marketing: Additional cottage industry emporiums and sales deports will be opened at the main trading centers and other important places in the country. Agents will be appointed in other places to maximize sales in the absence of emporiums or sales depots. Such emporiums and sales depots will be made self supporting and be operated on commercial lines. Arrangements will also be made for government departments and agencies Research and Design Centre: Research activities will be stressed in order to develop improved implements and production techniques. New design will also be created and introduced to produce attractive articles. Service Centers: Service centers will be established in different parts of the country to provide central technical services such as calendaring and finishing operations for the textile industry. Karkhana Fail and Orphan Welfare Centre: Existing programmes which provide technical training to prisoners and orphan children will be extended. These programmes help such individuals to become usefu l citizens of Nepal. Such programmes will be run by a Board instead of the Department itself. Credit and Cooperative Organization: Production of handloom textiles, baskets, woolen goods, clay products, and thus become eligible for credit from the Cooperative Bank. During the Third Plan, the Cooperative Bank intends to provide credit totaling Rs 12,600,000 to 84 cottages and small scale industries. This and small scale industries. This will be of great assistance in the cooperative organization of craftsmen. Such societies will be autonomous bodies based on democratic and cooperative principles. Each society will be owned collectively by the members and managed by a managing committee elected by the members. In due course of time, there will be an organization at the national level which will have the responsibility of providing raw materials and facilities the marketing products of the Societies. CHAPTER XVI A geological survey of about 150 square kilometers of territory has been completed. In addition investigations have been made of the following: 2. Copper mines of Kulekhani, Arkhouli and Fikkal 3. Cobalt mines of Summer-Bhavar, Netadarling and Nagre Bharle areas 4. Placer gold in Kali Gandaki basin 5. Coal and Gas of Kathmandu Valley 7. Oil Deposit in Dailekh 8. Shale in the area of the Bander River In addition, pre-investment surveys have been conducted in the following places: 1. Mica deposits in Nuwakot and Ramechhap 2. Limestone deposits in Kathmandu and near Hetauda 3. Copper refining unit in Wapsa and Okhaldhunga. Technical assistance has been made available for the small workshops of that area. 4. Thosey Iron Ores: Construction of a laboratory and staff quarters gas been completed. The laboratory is limited to the chemical, metallurgical and geological research branches. Research work and analysis of sample submitted by both public and private sector industries were conducted. Third Plan Priority has been given to the geological survey activities during the Third Plan period. Preliminary surveys will be conducted to explore the basic mineral resources available. The United Nations is providing technical experts to assist in this undertaking. Once the preliminary geological survey locates mineral deposits, an intensive survey will be undertaken in the second phase to determine quantity, quality and other basic information. Moreover, during the Plan period, attention will be given to the preparation of geological maps of those areas feasible for commercial exploitation. In addition, preliminary as well as detailed survey work will be continued for mineral oil and gases in Piuthan, Chisapani, Jhapa and Morang districts. Further study will be made of the feasibility of establishing an iron industry using the iron deposit of Phulchowki. A detailed survey of copper deposits in Eastern Nepal will be completed during the Plan period. Field surveys of placer gold in the basins of the Gandhaki and Rapti rivers will be continued. Work will also be undertaken to find other metals such as cobalt, nickel, etc. A study will be completed during the first year of the Third Plan to determine whether the production of mica is feasible on a commercial basis in Easter and western Nepal. Because of the increasing demand for construction materials in Nepal, detailed studies will be made of lime, limestone, Chinese clay, quartz and other deposits. Accordingly a survey of limestone at Bhainse and Kathmandu and of sand and quartz for glass production at Hetuada and Kathmandu will be conducted. The above efforts will be of great importance in establishing mineral industries in the Fourth plan period. Buildings for the Research Laboratory and associated Research Centers will be completed and modern analytical equipment will be installed. Tourism and Archaeology Tourism Tourism is an important source of national income and foreign exchange for many countries of the world. Tourism is increasing in popularity and the inflow of tourists into Nepal is rapidly rising. Adequate transport facilities and modern hotel arrangements are necessary conditions for the development of tourism. Inadequate air transport and hotel facilities in Nepal have become the bottleneck to its development. However, the efforts made during the Second Plan period helped greatly to overcome such difficulties. During the Third Plan, therefore, greater stress will be placed on increasing air transport and hotel facilities in order to derive the maximum benefits from tourism. During the First Plan the Tourist Department was established and the Tourist Information Centre opened. As a result the increasing number of the hotels in Kathmandu, and such other facilities Tourists increased from 2,056 in 1958 to 5,954 in 1961 and 9,976 in 1964. The details are given in Table 23. As present, 270 hotel beds are available and additional 400 hotel beds will become available after the completion of two hotels now under construction in Kathmandu. Buildings at Kakani, Pokhara, Daman, Lumbini and Nagarkot have also been constructed for tourists. Third Plan It is estimated that by the last year of the Third Plan, 20,000 tourists will be visiting Nepal. The construction of Gaucher Runway is expected to be completed Hotel capacity will be doubled after the completion of hotels which are under construction at present. In addition, the construction of a new hotel with modern fitting and facilities is planned. Other facilities will be developed to lengthen the average period of stay of the tourists. Internal transport facilities will also be expanded. To provide facilities to visitors traveling over Tribhuwan Rajpath by car, the construction of an office building in Birgunj is envisaged under this programme. The representatives of the concerned offices of HMG will be the staff of this office in order to help tourists with customs and immigration formalities before entering Nepal. A building will be constructed in Kathmandu to house the Department of Tourism and the central offices of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation. To further publicize Nepal on international scale films of Nepalese attraction will be made and distributed. Tourist literature will also be distributed. Sight seeing in Nepal is not only limited but also expensive. The Department of Tourism will develop sight seeing facilities in Kathmandu. Tourists are national guests and the responsibility of inviting them to Nepal falls not only on he Department but also upon all Government officers and other related agencies. Attempts will be made to simplify legal and administrative procedures so that a minimum of inconvenience will occur. Archaeology The ancient history of Nepal is glorious. But research required to record this past is of recent origin. Recently the Archaeology Department was created to preserve objects of historical importance. The Department has conducted the excavation and study of about 60 historical places in the last three years. Excavations at Hadigaun and Lazimpat in the valley have been completed. Thirty-one books have been published in the Departmental publication series. Third Plan Preservation of Temples: Several temples and other old artifacts are major tourist attraction in the These are not properly maintained at present; extensive renovation and continued maintenance are urgently needed. Plans to preserve these historical objects, therefore, will be implemented in three Durbar Squares. Preservation of Historical Museum: A plan has been worked out to preserve different places of historical importance, including Lumbani, Kapilvasto, and the birth place of Lord Buddha. Necessary measures will be taken to be of historical importance. National Archives Building: The construction of a national archives building will be completed during the first year of the Third Plan. The building will be well furnished and a system of keeping the records of all objects of historical importance in a scientific and modern method will be followed. Lumdini: A master plan will be prepared for the future development of Lumbini garden. Necessary steps will be taken to receive financial assistance form different Buddhist Associations of friendly nations to construct and establish a library in Lumbini. The archaeological excavation and research work will be expanded during the Third Plan period. Results of such work will be published. Archeologists will be encouraged to undertake research and excavation work of historical places. Foreign Trade Foreign trade is of strategic importance in this age of increasing mutual relationship and cooperation among the various countries. It is especially important for the developing countries since they have to import new techniques technical knowledge and many products from developed countries. From the long term point of view, trade can contribute greatly to the economic development of a country. External markets are large relative to its domestic market, and the cost of imports can be offset by expanding exports. Hence, it would not be wrong to say that trade development is an integral part of planning for economic development. Growth of Foreign Trade In the present Nepalese economy, international trade plays but a limited role. Available statistical data in the field of trade are not adequate. Nevertheless, the growth of trade in recent years has been sufficient to justify considerable optimism regarding future prospects. As tables in the appendix reveal, the volume of foreign trade has increased three times within five years: imports have risen 281 percent and exports 362 percent. Characteristics of Trade Eighty-five percent of Nepalese exports consist of food and raw materials. In 1961-62, food alone made up 65 percent of total exports. But the exports of finished goods have been expanding only 1.5 percent of total exports in 1957-58 consisted of finished goods, and then had raised to 13 percent by 1961-62. Seventy percent of total imports consist of food, cigarettes, finished products, gasoline, oil and other minor items. In the last few years, though the imports of finished consumption goods have increased, imports of food have decreased. Imports of goods related to industrial development have been increasing. It is obvious from this short summary that Nepal, like many other developing countries, depends on the export of primary goods and the import of consumer goods and producer goods. Fluctuations in the rise of primary goods and increases in the imports of consumer and producer goods may have adverse effects upon the Nepalese development effort if corrective measures are not taken. Trade with China is still relatively small. Trade with overseas countries is very small, although it has been increasing during the last few years. Nepal exports jute and jute goods to overseas countries and imports construction materials, producer and consumer goods from these countries. Imports of capital goods will continue to increase, a part of which must come from hard currency areas. Therefore, to meet hard currency payments, exports to overseas countries must be increased. Balance of International Trade Table 24 shows that there has been a deficit every year on the balance of international trade. This deficit may be overstated because the statistical data are not complete. There is no record, for example, of some of the export of timber, leather and jute on which custom duties are not levied. Although foreign aid and domestic monetary policy have also had an impact upon these holdings it seems reasonable to conclude that had there been continuous and severe trade deficits, these holdings would have been much less. Nevertheless it is necessary to stress that, on the basis of data available the international trade balances have been unfavorable. Some improvement has become evident during that last few years, partly because prices of exportable goods have risen, but also because quantities exported have increased. Foreign Trade in the Third Plan Given the foregoing characteristics of Nepalese trade, the following policies will be stressed in the Third Plan: Increase in Exports Efforts will be made to increase exports by 100 per cent within the coming five years. It is obvious that since import of production goods from development countries will be increasing, exports to overseas countries should be increased as much as possible. To achieve these objectives, production of exportable goods such as paddy, jute, oilseeds, etc, will be increased and special attention given to those which can be exported to overseas countries. In addition, foreign exchange advantages will be provided to the exporters. At the same time, attempts will be made to improve the quality of export goods. Change in the Volume of Imports To reduce the foreign trade deficit, it is anticipated that the volume of imports must also be reduced, in addition to expanding exports. To achieve development goals, however, imports of capital goods must increase. Therefore, to reduce imports as a whole emphasis must be placed upon reducing consumer goods imports. As a compensating measure, domestic production of consumer goods imports. During the Second Plan, this objective was fulfilled to some extent through the constr4uction of the sugar, cigarette and shoe factories. The Private sector has also stepped up the production of consumer goods. Additional measures will be undertaken during the Third Plan, as noted in the chapter on industry. Diversifying Trade with Developed Countries In recent years, the volume of imports form China and the USSR have been increasing. But this has been in the form of aid instead of trade. During the Third Plan, attempts will be made to further diversify trade by trade treaties with overseas and developed countries by other measure. In the country at present, there is still a lack of the necessary conditions for trade. Transportation, banking and insurance facilities are not adequate. Improvements in these fields must precede large increases in trade. In the Third Plan period, steps will be taken to overcome these short comings. CHAPTER XIX Power Power is a basic requirement in the economic development of any country. In Nepal, there hydroelectric power potential is immense because of abundant water resources. However, development to date is not satisfactory and serious thought has to be given power development during the Third Plan period. Lack of adequate transport facilities, hydrological survey data and technicians cause many bottlenecks. Yet the efforts made are not discouraging. The total power at the beginning of the Second Plan was less than 10,000 kilowatts. The Second Plan set a target of generating an additional 30,000 kilowatts by implementing various projects to meet the growing demand for power. Thus installation of associated transmission lines and improvements in distribution systems was also included in the Plan. It is now estimated that during the Second Plan power capacity was increased by only 7,500 kilowatts by the various projects which were implemented. The first phase of Trisuli Hydel Project could not be completed. Only one unit of the projects was installed during the Second Plan. Other projects completed, or nearly so, during the Second Plan are Panauti (2,400 kilowatts) and the Birgunj and Patan diesel plants (2000 kilowatts). In addition, considerable progress has been made in installing diesel plants in Biratnagar and Hetauda. Hydrological survey has also been conducted on the Karnali, Kulekhni and Other rivers. Third Plan To determine the demand of industrial concerns and households for power a plan has been framed dividing the country in three broad sections: Eastern, Central and Western. On the basis of this, a target of installing power capacity totaling 60,000 kilowatts has been set for the Second Plan. Central Section The present total available power supply in the Central section, comprising the areas of Kathamndu, Birgunj and Hetauda, is 12,000 kilowatts. It is estimated that at least 60,000 kilowatts will be needed by the end of this Plan period. The following power projects, after their completion, will produce additional power to meet the growth power demand: In addition, the Gandaki Project which is being constructed by the Government of India is expected to provide 10,000 kilowatts of power to Nepal by the end of the Third Plan. A detailed survey for power plants on the Marsyandi, Kali and the Kulekhani rives and for another plant on Trisuli rivers will be conducted in the first year of the Plan. Construction of the most beneficial projects will be undertaken in the second year. The power plants selected for construction will presumably be large enough to provide the additional power needed during the Plan period. The new project will generate at least 16,000 kilowatt of power by the end of the Plan period. The construction of 66 KV transmission line and substations Kathmandu, Hetauda and Birgunj will be completed. Additional 11 KV and 33 KV transmission lines and substations will also be installed. Upon completion of these projects power distribution in Kathmandu Valley will be through 220 volt lines. Transmissions lossed which are now estimated to be 40 percent will be reduced to 10 per cent. Survey will also be conducted in the Bhairawa, Butwal. Bharatpur and Hetauda areas and a transmission system (or systems) designed accordingly. Eastern Section Installed power capacity today is 5,000 kilowatts. Compared with future requirements, this is a negligible amount. Generating capacity totaling 9,000 kilowatts will be made available during the Third Plan. This will include a 1,470 kilowatts diesel plant at Biratnagar and 7,500 kilowatts form the Kosi Project; both of which are now under construction. To provide still more power for the estaer sector, hydrological data will be collected for the Kanaki and other fivers of the region and at least preliminary development planas prepared. It is anticipated; however that actual construction of these additional plants will be installed, therefore, to meet the power requirements of towns in Jhapa, Illam and Saptari districts on a temporary basis through NIDC assistance. To link the Kosi generating plant with Biratnagar, a transmission line will also be constructed. Western Section Power facilities in the western section are almost non-existent at present. One diesel plant with a capacity of 500 kilowatt will be constructed in Nepalgunj in the first year of the Plan period. Since there is little possibility of starting hydroelectric projects in the near future, small diesel plants will be installed to meet the growing demands for power. The major effort in the West will be to complete the study of the Karnali river and to begin construction of the first phase. Organization Reforms Measures will be taken to improve the administration of the Department of Electricity and the Electricity Corporation to coordinate the effects of the two organizations. Establishment of a central power Authority is under consideration. Its purpose would be to prepare a long term master plan for the production and distribution of power and to supervise the power generating units in the eastern section. CHAPTER XX Transport Transportation has a strategic role to play to bring about efficiency and coordination in administration and to increase the volume of internal trade. Both are essential to the process of industrialization. Priority was given to transportation in the First and Second Plan, but the headway made so far is negligible in comparison to our needs. The mountainous terrain of Nepal makes construction of reads a difficult job; the development of a railway system is quite impossible; and air transportation is very expensive. In this situation plans for the development of the transport system of Nepal must be prepared both from a short term and a long term point of view. With these objectives in mind His Majesty’s Government invited thee International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to survey the existing transport system, make projections regarding future needs, and prepare a master plan for transport development. The following elements of the plan for transport are based upon the study. Road Construction in the First and Second Plan Before the launching of First Plan the total length of all roads in Nepal was 624 kilometers. Including of 368 km. of fair-weather roads. The First Five Year Plan set a target of building 1440 more km, including 480 km. of metal led roads and 960 km. fair weather roads. In 1958, the Regional Transport Organization (RTO) was established in a tripartite agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of India and the Unites States to construct these roads. But technical and other difficulties made it impossible to achieve the targets as set the Plan. In 1961, the RTO was dissolved. High priority was also given to the development of transport during the Second Plan period. The targets was to build 1440 km. of roads, including 320 km. of all weather roads were constructed. By the end of the Plan period only 820 km. of roads were constructed. Of this total 849 were fair-weather roads: 621 km. of the East-west Highway, 112 km. of the Kathmandu-Kodari Highway, 54 km. near Kailabas and Ghorahi, 29 km. in Dang and 13 km. in the Saptari-Kunoli and Ratna Ray Path. Thus most of the roads constructed in Nepal so far are fair-weather jeep able roads. Only 454 km. of all-weather roads exist. Road Construction in the Third Plan During the Third Plan, 1604 km. of roads will be built including 720 km. of fair-weather roads. In addition existing roads will be renovated. Table 25 shows the roads to be constructed during the Third Plan period. East-West Highway The construction of 381 km. of roads stretching from Mechi in the east to Adhawar in the west will be completed during the Plan period. This will line all important towns, production centres and markets of the eastern Terai with Kathmandu, since the Raxual-Kathmandu roadway joins the East-West Highway. The existing portion of the East-West Highway, Stretching from Hetauda to Narayan Gadh, will be improved. From Narayan Gadha west to Butwal the road will be extended on a fair-weather basis, Survey, design and cost estimates will be completed on the remaining portion running 432 km. west from Butwal to Banbass. Thus, by the end of the Third Plan period, nearly 50 per cent of the 1040 km. East-West Highway will be completed. Raxaul-Kathmandu-Kodari Road Kathmandu is already linked with Raxaul on the Indian border including Raxaul to Amlekgang 39 km. and Hetauda to Bhainse 19 km. Further improvements will be made of 5.8 km during the Third Plan, particularly in the Raxual-Bahinse sector. By the end of the period an all-weather road will connect Kathmandu with the Indian border (and railhead) to the south and the Chinese border to the north. Sunauli-Pokhara This road, 205 km. long, will be completed during the Third Plan. Kathmandu=Pokhara Construction and Improvement of Local Bridges and Roads Construction of new roads will not be of lasting significance unless a proper system of repair and maintenance is established. Therefore, during the Third Plan emphasis will be given to maintenance and further improvement of roads and bridges, both new and existing, so that the roads system as a whole will be maintained for heavy use. Construction and Improvement of Local Bridges and Roads. Construction of Suspension Bridges Several rivers of Nepal flowing from north to south either have no bridges at important crossing or have bridges usable only in the dry season. Because much foot -traffic must cross these rivers, suspension bridges are needed at many points. Therefore, 15 bridges will be constructed during the Third Plan. Aid to Panchayat for the Construction of Local Roads The Roads Department will provide financial and technical assistance to different village and district panchayats to help them build local road. For the most part, local resources will construct these roads, but governmental aid will be of great importance in providing proper technical guidance and in supplying construction items not available locally. Miscellaneous During this Plan period, a material laboratory will be established to study and test construction materials. The laboratory will also make the results of its research available to concerned departments. Several buildings for divisional offices of the Road Department will be constructed in different parts of the country. This will enable them to supervise the construction of new roads and the repairs and maintenance of roads in the several divisions more efficiently. His Majesty’s Government has created a new division under the Roads Department to work out future plans and to conduct surveys for road construction in various parts Nepal. Such activities will be expanded during the Plan period. Provision for Vehicles Mere construction of roads is not enough in Nepal. Proper utilization of roads is also required. Investments, particularly in trucks and buses, will be encouraged through existing financial institutions. Air Transport It will take considerable time and resources to develop roads in Nepal. Air transport therefore, will remain important as a means of providing access to the hill areas of Nepal. Progress to Date Before the launching of the First Five Year Plan, air services were available only in five places: Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bhairawa, Simra and Birtnagar. Upon completion of the First Plan, Nepal could provide air facilities in 12 places in the country. In addition, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established to provide regular air services. Improvements on the Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Bhairawa airfields were made. Considerable headway was made in the construction of airports during the Second Plan: short –take -off and landing (STOL) airstrips were3 completed in B.aglung, Jumla and Jiri, and a 1,524 meter fair-weather airfield in Jhapa District. Steps were taken to improve facilities at Bahirawa and Biratnagar and bring them up to all-weather standards. A 3,300 ft. cross-runway in Kathmandu was planned and construction begun if Kathmandu. Program under the Third Plan The result of the survey team of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, submitted in September, 1964, classified air facilities in Nepal into three groups: Measures will be taken to develop these 15 airfields of which 8 are all weather, 4 pair-weather, and 3 interim fields. During the Third Plan period, the airfields at Biratnagar, Nepalgunj and Tumlingetar will be made all- weather fields and brought up to the standard required of the permanent classifying above. By the end of the Plan, six out of eight permanent airfields will be of all-weather standard. Of the remaining two airports, surveys and construction work will be completed at Doti airfield. As the present Pokhara airfield is not properly located for use by large planes, plans will be developed to construct a new strip about 4 miles east of the present one. Construction of the Gaucher cross-runway will be completed by the end of the first year of the Plan. Since Gaucher Airport is the most important airfields in Nepal. Attempt must be made to make it s modern one. A master plan for development and modernization will be prepared by consulting firm and work begun to turn the prese4nt Gaucher Airport into a modern international. A new terminal building, two hangers, a car parking lot and a new road leading to the airport are all under construction and will be completed early in the Third Plan. At other airports, Bharatpur, Dang, Gorkha and Dhangadhi, terminal buildings, staff quarters and other facilities will be constructed to bring the entire air transport system of Nepal up to as high a standard as resources and experience will permit. Construction of 20 small airstrips will be undertaken in the hilly regions of Nepal where large planes cannot land. In the First year of the Plan, steps will be taken to locate suitable places and acquire land. Four strips will be constructed in the second year and another 16 by the end of the Plan period. This will provide needed transport facilities in the hill areas and make it possible to step up the rate of development considerably. The Civil Aviation Department will be strengthened and improved. Its responsibilities include the construction and maintenance of all the airfields in the country and the operation of the air communication system. Depending upon the traffic and financial support available, form one to three new faster planes will be purchased for external flights. Present Dakota planes will continue to be used for internal flights. Repair and maintenance facilities will be expanded and improved. Training for RNAC staff will be conducted in Nepal and both flight and service personnel will be sent abroad for advanced training. A new central office will construct for the airline. Twelve staffs quarter and storage facilities for fuel, spare parts and equipment will be located at various airports. New buses for passengers will be provided in Calcutta. Patna, New Delhi, Simra, Biratnagaar, Bhairawa and Kathmandu. Railway Transport In India railways occupy a prominent place in transportation services. In Nepal, however, it is very difficult to construct railway: only two lines exist at present. One runs from Raxaul to Amlikhgunj, a distance of 29 miles. The other links Jayanagar to Janakpur. Both link points in Nepal to Indian railheads. Although the Raxaul- Amlikhgunj line was of considerable importance when first constructed in 1927, traffic on the Raxaul-Kathmandu road opened in 1956 has reduced its significance in the transport system. Programme in the Third Plan Construction of Railway Terminal in Birgunj: Goods coming from the Indian meter-gauge railway at Raxaul are unloaded before being shifted to the Raxaul-Amlikhgunj railway or to trucks for transport to various points in Nepal. The Nepalese customs checkpoint is at Birgunj just across the border from Raxaul. Much confusion, revenue loss and damage to goods now occur because of the repeated loading and unloaded easily. Custom facilities will also be constructed near the present Nepalese railway station. N.F.F.R. : As there is no proramme to construct roads from Jayanagar to Janakpur are present, the railroad connecting these points is expected to continue to carry considerable freight and passengers. Plans will be development to improve existing facilities and possibly to extend the line to Chissapani. Ropeway: In view of the hilly topography of the country and the relative cheapness of ropeway transportation, the ropeways, can become an important means of transport. The Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway had demonstrated the economic benefits of ropeway. However, in the absence of detailed surveys it is not possible to determine the economically beneficial sites for the ropeways. Therefore, in this plan, programmes have been made for surveys. Once the sites are determined, construction can be undertaken later. National Transport Organization Recently a National transport organization has been established to maximize the utilization of the transport resources of the country. The principle objective of the organization is to effectively coordinate the ropeway, railway and other means of transportation in the Bagmati and Narayani zones. Moreover, the Organization will provide facilities and guidance to different transport organization in the private sector. The importance of these vit al factors in the time of national awakening cannot be overstressed. As governmental and commercial decentralization increase throughout the country, there must be effective communication links between the center and the district. Postal Services The first postal service was begun in 1875. About 100 post offices were then established. Thee main objective was internal administration and national security. Just prior to the first Plan the number of post offices had risen to only 124. During the First Plan Nepal acquired membership in the International Postal Union. In the Three Year Plan period, emphasis was lid on consolidation of the existing postal system. The General Post Office the center was expanded and seven Zonal Post Officers were established to supervise and control the postal services between zones. Now there are 4 City Post Officers, 9 Central Post Officers and 153 Branch Post Offices in the country. In addition, there are three Post Offices, which is now responsible for foreign postal services. There are three mail routes (1) Western Hill Route; (2) Eastern Hill Route; (3) eastern Hill route. Internal letter insurance and internal parcel insurance and internal parcel insurance services have been recently started. In order to utilize the facilities available under the International Postal Union, Nepal has reached agreements with India and China and is negotiating with Pakistan, the United States and the United Kingdom. Third Plan The number of post offices is insufficient for present needs. Therefore, the post offices will be increased and existing officers expanded and improved. The organization of the postal system will be modified and other steps taken to improve efficiency and service. Highlights of the program are as following: Organization: An effective administrative system is the precondition for an expansion of postal services. To achieve a greater degree of specialization, the total postal system will be subdivided into administrative postal services categories. Seven more Supervisory Post Offices at zonal level will be establishing. At the district 28 Superintending Offices will be established which will work as a link between the Zonal Supervisory Office and the operating offices. Branch Post Offices: According to the Postal Survey Reports prepared during the Second Plan, there should be one Post Office to cover an area to 110 square miles. Therefore, 130 more post offices will be required. Of these, 85 will be established in the Third Plan period. in deciding upon the location of these new post offices, area and population to be served and existing postal facilities will be taken into account. Cooperative Post Offices: The first Cooperative post offices was established in 1957 and increased to 150 by 1961. Although many of them were closed due to lack of cooperation and inadequate inspection and guidance from the Department, the results justify und further expansion. The target for the Third Plan will be to establish 400 more Cooperative Post Offices. These will be run by village panchayats with the assistance of the Postal Department. Extension of Postal Routs: In order to make postal services effective, a survey to determine the location of 20 new postal routs will be carried out. Existing routes will also be studied and necessary changes will be made. Surface and Air Mail: In order to utilize new highway facilities, mail vans will be put use as rapidly as the highway network is expanded— e.g. mail vans will soon ply the Kathmandu-Kodari road and portions of the East-West Highway, Air mail services will be extended to remote areas of Nepal as soon as plane service is extended. Inspections of Mail Services: The people are the ultimate sufferers from theft and careless handling of mail. Faith in the reliability of the postal services diminishes. To do away with these shortcomings, postal inspectors will be trained and a postal inspection service established. These inspectors will be posted at first in Kathmandu and the number will then be increased to cover different parts of the country. Money Orders: Money order service is only possible it inspection of mail is effective. The operation of a money order services will thus be undertaken in the second year of the Plan, after the mail inspection program has been implemented. Philatelic Scheme: This scheme will be made more effective in order to get maximum advantage for the sale of postage stamps. A variety of postage stamps in attractive design will be printed so as to increase income. Telecommunication Use of telephone and wireless service was limited to a few districts of Nepal at the beginning of the first Plan. Some 300 line were operating in Kathnamdu. During the First Plan, a modern automatic system with a capacity of 3,000 lines was installed in Kathmandu. Shortly after World War II, wireless sets were installed were installed in 28 districts. These were replaced by new sets in 35 district beginning in the latter part of the First Plan. Three Year Plan Progress In the field of wireless installation, seven zonal area control stations were established, and 50 wireless cenrters under these control stations were also installed. An international telecommunication system was completed with two circuits linking from Kathmandu, Delhi and Calcutta. With the establishment of two teleprinter centers, prompt communication of news from foreign countries has become possible The existing 1,000 telephone lines at Kathmandu have proved insufficient, and steps have been taken to add some 4,000 more lines. Installation of a 300 lines system with a local exchange at Biratnagar has been completed and will start functioning during the first year of the Third Plan period. The Nepal-Pak telecommunication project is nearing completion and will start functioning at the beginning of the Third Plan. The Program in the Third Plan The following telecommunication projects will be carried out during the Third Plan: Completion of Present Schemes: Installation of an additional 4,000 lines in Kathmandu, plus a 600 lines exchange at Patan will be finished. Installation of can additional 300 lines in the Singha Durbar Secretariat will also be completed. Installation of the 300 lines system at Biratnagar will be finished during the first year. East-West micro Wave: The present telephone system within Nepal extends eastward from Kathmandu through Dhankuta, Jaleshwor and Janakpur to Biratnagar and westward to Plapa. This line is old and not properly functioning. Hence, this will be replaced by micro -wave system. This system will be capable of carrying messages continuously through hundreds of chan nels and will not be affected by the monsoon. Fifty per cent of the total project will be completed during the Third Plan and the remainder will be carried over to the next plan. Trunk Call Service: The following services will be established under this scheme: 1. The telephone service between the towns in India and Kathmandu will be operated through as 8-channel carrier system. There will be a direct contact between Kathmandu and Patan through one of these channels. The other channels will be used to maintain contact with other towns. 2. There will be five circuits between Kathmandu and Birgunj. A direct link from Kathmandu to Hetauda, and Hetauda to Birgunj will be established as separate circuit. Under this system, direct contact between Hetauda and Bhainse, Hetauda and Amlekhgunj, and Birgunj and Simra will be possible. Of these five circuits, one circuit will be specifically used to contact Palung-Hetauda vicinity from Kathmandu. Telegraph System: A Six-channel V.T.T. telegraph system will be established to communicate masses from Kathamdnu to India and various other centers. Further, there will be four teleprinter sets for news service between Kathmandu and Birgunj. These English script teleprinter sets will be replaced by Nepali script teleprinters in the future Telephone Exchange: In Birgunj, a 300 lines automatic exchange and a trunk exchange services will be established. There will be four direct lines, and two booking and inquiry lines. For the trunk call service between Kathmandu and other districts of the country, a trunk exchange service having four enquiries and booking lines will be established. The international trunk exchange will also be started at Kathmandu. Public call centers with ten magneto board systems will be established in Palung, Bhainse, Hetauda, Amlekhgunj and Simra. CHAPTER XXII Education Education plays an important role in the field of social economic development. Technical and Adminis trative knowledge required for the creation of a modern society is obtained from an education that is in keeping with the need of the times. In addition, education is vital for the promotion of the intellectual and physical personality of the people. An educated peasant, aware of the needs of reform in agriculture, will be enthusiastic to adopt modern methods cultivation. Significant progress has been achieved in education over the last few years. However, Nepal still lags far behind in this field in comparison with other countries of the world. It is imperative, therefore, to step up the efforts in educational development in the coming years. But such efforts should be preceded by a careful consideration of several factors, particularly the storage of financial resources and technical know-how. In order to attain maximum benefit from the scarce resources, a well coordinated ant comprehensive education programme should be formulated. Development of education calls for an adequate supply of trained teachers as well as education materials, which will take a long time to be fulfilled. The number of primary schools can be increased only in proportion to the teachers trained in the normal schools. Since primary and secondary education programmes have to be developed in a coordinated way, the expansion of primary education will determine the provision to be made for secondary education. Following the Karachi Plan 1962-63, His Majesty’s Government has adopted the policy of providing primary school facilities to all boys and girls by 1980. Development of secondary and higher education should be carefully, considered, bearing in mind the expansion of primary education and the growing need for educated manpower. The objectives for education in The Third Plan period are as follows: 1. To provide education to 40 percent of the boys and girls from six to eleven years of age and to expand the teachers’ training programme in the same proportion. 2. To develop secondary and vocational education in accordance with the need for skilled and semi-skilled personnel. 3. To raise the standard of teaching in secondary and higher educational institutions. 4. To supply books and other education materials as required by the educational institutions. 5. To make necessary improvements in the work the Education Ministry concerning statistics and programming in order to create a sound base for the formulation of education development programmes in the future. Education Development Programme Based on the above policy guidelines and objectives the following programme for education at different levels has been proposed in this plan period. Primary Education Progress made during the last few years in primary education is encouraging. By the end of the second Plan, 27 per cent of the children of school going age received some primary education, compared to 0.7 percent in 1949-50 and 15.3 percent in 1961-62. There is still much to be done to set up a sound system and to raise the standard of education. At present for example, thee number of fifth year students is less than 10 per cent of the first year students. It is due partly to the fact that there are 300 one-teacher schools where students cannot pursue their studies further than the 1st and 2nd classes. Hence over half of the primary school students do not go beyond the first class. An education of this kind is costly and of limited benefits hence a misuse of the country’s scarce resources. It is therefore necessary that the number of classes be increased in existing schools so that students do not encounter a dead end. Primary schools must also be extended to more areas. The target under the Third Plan will be to provide education to 40 per cent of the children of school age. In order to fulfill the demand for teachers in the primary schools, 5,000 teachers will be trained with the extension of the teach training programme. In addition, further training will be given to teachers now saving in 3,000 primaries schools. In this programme, priority will be given to those schools that provide free and compulsory education. In order to make text -books available for the primary schools, sixteen books will be published and distributed. Management of schools will be decentralized in those districts where it is found appropriate. Grants given by His Majesty’s Government to the primary schools will be gradually reduced so as to the schools locally self-sufficient. Secondary Education The programme in secondary education exceeded the targets set for it in the Second Plan, but it is not keeping pace with the programme in primary education. Special effort will be made in this plan to coordinate the programmes in the two fields. In addition, improvement in the quality of secondary education is necessary. For example, the percentage of students passing the examination given at the end of secondary training and receiving their School Leaving Certificate (S.C.L.) is very low. Attention will be given to this point during this Plan period. During the Third Plan, the enrolment of secondary school students will be increased from 40,000 to 68,000 by upgrading 115 primary schools into middle schools and 36 middle schools into high schools. Under this programme 1,000 secondary school teachers will be trained. Provision for the required education materials will also be made. Hostel facilities will be provided to the students coming from distant places. Special studies will be undertaken in different high schools to evaluate the effects of the various steps taken under the education development programme and seminars of supervisors and teachers will be organized. The aim of the vocational education program is to combine occupational and general knowledge. To achieve this objective, high schools have been converted into multi-purpose schools to provide, in addition to the basic curriculum, vocational training in agriculture, industries etc. During the Second Plan period, 16 agriculture secondary schools were converted into multi-purpose schools and training has been given in four subjects: agriculture, home science, commerce and secretarial skills. In addition, construction of a technical institute and a demonstration multi-purpose high school with capacities of 600 and 500 students respectively was begun. Every year 100 vocational teachers are given 8 weeks’ in -service training. During the Third Plan period, teaching in the technical institute and the demonstration multi-purpose school will be started. By 1970-71 it is proposed to open both of these educational institutions at full capacity. A hostel accommodation 250 students for the technical institute and another for 100 students at the demonstration school will be constructed. In the present 16 multi-purpose schools, the number of vocational classes will be increased from 120 to 320 and thus 5,000 students will receive multi-purpose education. Ten more high schools will be converted into multi-purpose school to provide vocational training for another 2,500 students. At the zonal level three vocational school buildings and hostels will be constructed. More than 60 workshops will be arranged over the country and guidance and supervision will be given the multi-purpose and vocational schools. Adult Education Under the adult education programme initiated in 1956-57 it is established that about 100,000 adults were made literate by 1965-66. During this Plan period an additional 100,000 adults will be made literature. Moreover, a regular evaluation of this adult education programme will be made and contact maintained with the trained adults in order to keep the students in touch with what they have learned. Education Materials Significant progress has been made in the production and distribution of education materials as a result of steps taken in accordance with the recommendation made by the National Education Planning commission in 1954-55. It is evident however that education materials required in the future will be grown rapidly as the number of students increases and the quality of education improves. Therefore, the programme for the production of education materials will be expanded according to need: 75 new books will be prepared and published— some for use by students as texts and others by teachers by as reference. In addition to the three quarterly magazines now being published. Two other quarterlies will be started. A Nepalese dictionary of scientific and technical terms will be prepared with the help of the Royal Nepal academy. Higher Education At present these are 29 Arts and Science Colleges in 11 of the 14 zones. Fourteen of these colleges are centered in the Bagamti zone alone. In 18 colleges, however, number of students is less than 100. The curriculum is very weak in many instances. It is evident from these facts that a special effort should be made to raise the standard education and that improvement in the organization of the colleges and in the curriculum must receive first attention. In this Plan the higher education programme has been divided into four parts: (1) Collage improvement,(2) Secondary school teacher training, (3) Primary school teacher and (4) Tribhuwan University. College Improvement Programme Under this programme, honors classes will be organized in some subjects at Tri-Chandra College and necessary facilities will be made available for this purpose. The library of the Tri-Chandra College will be expended. An examination hall will also be constructed. In addition, other colleges will be given assistance for building construction. At present about 2,200 teachers are teaching in the secondary schools, of which adequately trained teachers’ number only 100. This is mainly because only a few of the persons trained in the College of Education work as teachers after graduation. It is, therefore, necessary to make provision for the employment of the trained persons as teachers along with an increase in the capacity of the teacher-training institutions. In this Plan period, new teacher training collages will be set up by providing one year and two year B. Ed. Course. In addition, a Master of Education degree programme will be initiated at Tribhuwan University. Great stress will be laid on teaching methods in workshops to be conducted twice every year. Necessary steps will be taken to make the teaching profession attractive for the trained persons. Primary School Teacher Training The main objective of the primary school teachers training programme is to train teachers for the primary schools, and to bring about uniformity in t he teaching methods and curriculum of the primary schools. Under this programme 4,500 teachers have been trained since 1954-55 in seven normal schools now functioning in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Dharan, Illam, Pokhara, Palpa and Salyan. During the Third Plan Period, a new normal school will be established at Dandeldhura and hostels will be built at Birgunj, Dharan, Illam and Palpa. During the vacation period normal school workshops will be organized where the curriculum will be revised and revised as necessary. Tribhuwan University Under the building construction programme as envisaged in the Second Plan, a chemistry department building, a student hostel, staff quarters and a memorial hall have been completed. The College of Education buildings and a library are under construction. Another objective in the Second Plan was to increase the number of Nepalese lectures in the University. Satisfactory progress has been made in this field as well. During the current Plan period, expansion will be made in the facilities of the Arts, Science and Commerce collages. In particular, special effort will be made to initiate higher studies in Chemistry, Biology, Botany and Physics. As mentioned above, Master of Education classes will also be started. Construction of buildings for the Physics Department and two hostels will be completed soon in order to open classes for the M. S. degree in Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Botany. By the end of the Plan period, construction of an Arts College building, staff quarters and office buildings will be completed. In addition necessary provision will be made for a gymnasium, a playground, water, electricity and roads on the campus. Master plan for the development of Kirtipur Campus will also be prepared. The present educational system and the curriculum will be reviewed and necessary revisions will be made. Health As in other fields, Nepal lags far behind in health services. A number of development projects have been undertaken during the First and Second Plan periods, but a well-organized health service is still lacking. A large number of people still fall victim cholera, small-pox, tuberculosis and malaria. As a result, the average life expectancy of a Nepalese is 32 years, whereas in India, Pakistan and Japan it is 45, 45 and 70 respectively. The annual death rate is Nepal 21 per thousand and infant mortality is 244 per thousand. In order to increase the average life expectancy of the people, improve their health and enlist their active participation in development, malaria must be eradicated from the area where 4,500,000 people live and covering 40160.0 kilometers. The country must be freed from the menace of tuberculosis, small-pox, leprosy and other diseases. Programme in the Previous Plans During the First Plan period, hospitals with capacity totaling 149 beds were constructed and 79 health centres established. In the second Plan three more hospitals and 8 health centres were added, bringing the total number of hospital beds to 1,156. Malaria eradication work has been completed in the Central Zone and it is under way in the Eastern Zone. In Kathmandu 450,000 people have been inoculated against small-pox and a survey of leprosy has been completed. Third Plan Under the present circumstances, it will inevitably take sometime to development a satisfactory programme in the health services of the country. Financial resources are not the only hurdle to overcome. Lack of administrative and technical personnel is an equally important limitation in this field. In order to make any headway, the number of doctors, nurses and other personnel has to be increased. But training these personnel takes time. Great emphasis is given to preventive measures. Thee programme for the Third Plan will be as follows: Malaria Eradication: In the central zonal, D.D.T Spraying work has been in progress since 1960, and the survey work will be continued. In fiscal 1065-66, survey work will be completed; in 1966-67, under the consolidation phase, malaria insects will be widely investigated. If all goes well, in the final year of the Third Plan, the maintenance phase will be started in the central zone. In the eastern zone D.D.T. spraying work will be continued up to the fourth year of the Third Plan and the consolidation phase will be initiated in the final year. In the western zone, D.D.T. will be sprayed from the first year of the Plan and survey work will started in selected areas beginning in the third year. The Consolidation phase in this zone well not be completed, however, until the middle of the fourth plan. Eradication of Small-Pox: Small-pox eradication work on a pilot project basis was initiated in the country in 1962-63 with the help of the World Health Organization (W.H.O). Within the Third Plan period, the inhabitants of Kathmandu and other districts will be inoculated against small-pox Eradication of Tuberculosis: A tuberculosis eradication pilot project was initiated recently with the help of W.H.O and UNICEF. Under this programme the procedure is to find and treat tuberculosis cases. This programme will be undertaken in Kathmandu for the first three years of the Plan. In the last two years it will be extended to Morang and Parsa districts. Leprosy Control and Survey: This pilot project was started in Kathmandu in 1962-63 in order to identify the victims of leprosy, to treat them and to set up leprosy control centres. At present, this work is carried out at Pachali Clinic, Khokana Leprosarium and four other clinics. Two additional clinics and an ambulatory unit will be established. A leprosarium will also be constructed. Skin and Venereal Disease Control: As the present Pachali Clinic for skin and venereal disease in not up-to-date, a new building will be constructed, and in Bir Hospital, a dermatological ward of 10 beds will be opened to treat persons suffering from these diseases. Hospital Services During the Third Plan, 12 health centres will be upgraded and converted to hospitals adding 475 hospital beds. In addition, 32 health centres will be provided with modern facilities and equipment and 103 health posts will be established. Further more, 8 zonal offices will be opened to strengthen the health services. Details of the programme are as follows: Hospitals: In order to raise the level of health services the Department of Health will convert 58 existing hospitals and the Hetauda health centre into 25-bed hospitals. Seven more district hospitals and 11 health centres will be converted into 15-beds hospitals. Heath Centres: During the plan, 32 health centers will be provided with doctors and necessary equipment. These health centres will be divided into tow groups. Each group will consist of 16 health centres. Both of these groups will be provided with doctors except that the first group will also have lady doctors. The second group will have assistance nurse midwives instead of lady doctors. Health Posts: During the Plan period 103 health posts will be established. These will be under the control of the district health organization with 3 to 5 health posts in each district where they are established. Each health post will have 3 to 6 mobile teams to cover assigned area of the district. Zonal Offices: During this Plan period, 8 new zonal offices will be established, which will be helpful in the supervision of local health units. There will be hospitals with 50 or 25 beds under these zonal offices. Training Programme In order to implement successfully the health services programme by making available trained personnel the following training programme have been incorporated in this Plan: Nurse Training: Under this programme the construction of a Nurses’ Training School in the Bir Hospital compound will be completed. Auxiliary Health Workers Training: This Plan aims art training 60 auxiliary health workers every year, for which adequate provision of buildings and hostel facilities will be made. In order to make the programme effective, training will also be given to persons working in the malaria eradication department and they will be reassigned. Training of Assistant Nurses and Midwives: As the Bharatpur centre alone cannot meet the country’s demand for assistant nurses and midwives, new training centre will be opened in the Plan period at Birtnagar and Nepalgunj. Medical College: at present, about fifteen persons are sent abroad for medical training each year. Of these, about 10 return as qualified doctors. At present, there are only two hundred doctors in Nepal. The ratio between doctors and population is 1 to 50,000. We have to train at least 100 doctors every year for the next several years in order to lower the ratio to 10,000. To provide a part of this training, a medical college will be established to start functioning within the Plan period. Family Planning: It is felt that the population of Nepal will grow at a faster rate as assured of the public health measures. Thus it will not be possible to increase the standard of living of the people unless the birth rate is checked. In this Plan period, four family planning clinics, two in Kathmandu and one each in Patan and Bhaktapur, will start functioning under the family planning branch of the Directorate of Health Services. Family planning education will be conducted and family planning devices distributed on a limited scale. If the programme proves successful, it will be extended to other areas. Public Health laboratory: The construction of the Public Health Laboratory building, which was started under the Three Year Plan, will be completed within this Plan period. Ayurvedic System: As regards Ayurved, the present Ayurved College and Ayurved Hospital of Kathmandu will be expanded so as to make available more training facilities. The Ayurvedic dispensary will also be reorganized and renovated. Drinking Water And Sewage Two things are necessary to create a healthy physical environment: (a) a supply of pure water in adequate quantity and (b) a sanitary sewage disposal system. It is necessary, therefore, to give emphasis to these works and a master plan for the supply of drinking water should be formulated from a long-term viewpoint. Such a master plan for the Kathmandu Valley is under preparation by joint efforts of His Majesty’s Government and then World health Organization. Third Plan Drinking Water: During the Third Plan period drinking water supply system will be developed in all of the important urban areas. Priority will be given to the areas without easy access to drinking water. The schemes incorporated in this Plan are as follows: Kathmandu: At present 8,182,800 litres of water per day are supplied to Kathmandu from the balaju and Maharajgunj reservoirs for a population ot 180,000. The distribution system is in poor condition. A scheme to increase the water supply by 32,000,000 gallons per day is under way. This scheme will be completed in the First year of the plan period, and will meet the requirements for the coming ten years. Fifty years from now, it is estimated that 9,000,000 gallons of water per day will be required. It appears from existing hydrological data those 15,000,000 gallons of water per day can be supplied from the Bagamti, Sialmati and Nagmati rivers. A master plan will therefore be framed to develop this long-term scheme. Lalitpur: Lalitpur with a population of 49,000 is the second largest town of Nepal. Only 400,000 gallons of drinking water per day are presently available against a need of 1,000,000 gallons per day. A scheme to supply 3,500,000 gallons of drinking water per day will be implemented during this plan Bhaktapur: Bhaktapur, with 34,400 populations, is the third largest town on Nepal. This present supply of drinking water is 120,000 gallons per day. During this Plan period 1,140,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Bhaktpur. When completed this project will supply 600,000 gallons per day. Kirtipur: At present 30,000 gallons of water per day are supplied to Kirtipur with a population of 8,000. With the completion of the proposed scheme in Latipur, 400,000 gallons of water per day will be supplied to kirtupur, Panga and the Tribhuwan University Campus. Thimi: Water supply at Thimi, Bodey, and Nagadesh is from tube-wells. A new scheme has become necessary as there is excess iron content in the tube-well water. Rajbiraj: no water supply scheme has been provided for Rajbiraj with a population of 12,000. During this plan period 300,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Rajbiraj by a project now under preparation. Nepalgun: Population is increasing rapidly in Nepalgunj which is inhabited now by 10,000 people. The present water supply is 5,000 gallons per day. A scheme to supply 28,000 gallons per day is underway and will be completed during this Plan period. Bhadrapur: Bhadrapur with a population of 6,000 is devoid of a modern water supply scheme. It has to depend on river water. Investigation is underway in order to provide 140,000 gallons of water per day. Construction work will be completed during this Plan Period. Dhangdi: During this Plan 150,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Dhangadi with a population of 6,400, which is in acute shortage of drinking water. Banepa: The existing water supply system which was set up 25 years ago will be improved in order to make available an additional 40,00 gallons per day. Dang: Hand pumps are the only source of drinking water for 4,200 inhabitants of Dang. A scheme will be implemented to supply 35,000 gallons per day. Koilabas: During this Plan period a scheme will be implemented to supply 75,000 gallons of drinking water per day in order to meet the present requirement. Terai and Hill areas: It is essential to make provision o\\\\for drinking water in some villages to Terai and the hills which are urgently in need of it. Under this scheme 35,000 gallons per day will be made available in different place to be selected later. Sewage Construction: at present, the only sewage system in Nepal of any consequence exists in some areas of Kathmandu. In the absence of a modern sewage system, disease epidemics frequently occur. It is therefore essential to develop a sanitary sewage along with the provision of drinking water. With the assistance of the World Health Organization, preliminary work has been started to formulate a master plan (Nepal. A detailed survey is necessary for the construction of a sewage system in Kathmandu as the next step. This program should be coordinated with the proposed master plan for the Kathmandu Valley. During this Plan period, the survey will be completed and construction sta rted. Experimental Village Sanitation Programme: This programme consists of both a water supply and a sewage disposal system. It will be started on an experimental basis in the three villages of Lalitpur, with the assistance of UNICEF. Under this programme a work shop will be established for the maintenance of the water supply system and necessary materials will be made available for the implementation of the schemes. Drinking Water Supply: In order to collect necessary information for the formulation of water supply schemes, surveys will be undertaken; this will be linked with the water resources discussed elsewhere. CHAPTER XXV Housing Programs At various cities in Nepal the problem of housing has become a severe one. Particularly in Kathmandu and Patan population is increasing of the rate of 2.2 per cent due to the mobility of people and the natural increase of population. The present population of Kathmandu and Patan is 171,000 whereas the number of houses at these two places is only 22,534. On the basis of one house required for one five-member family unit 34,200 houses are needed in Kathmandu and Patan alone, which means that an additional 11,686 houses are needed. In the first two plans, there was no provision for housing. Keeping in view the limited resources available and the preliminary nature of the work, the housing program will be launched on a limited scale during the Third Plan. Since 1950, a keen interest has been shown towards the construction of houses in the private sector. These new houses however, are designed especially for the purpose of renting to foreigners and the requirements of the common people have not been met. His Majesty’s Government has been advancing three years’ salary to the civil servants for the const ruction of houses as a further inducement; however, this amount is quite inadequate to cover construction costs, especially for middle class civil servants. Target of the Third Plan His Majesty’s Government will provide necessary incentives to the private sector in order to construct 400 new houses in Kathmandu, particularly for the use of the middle and low income groups. Utilities such as water, electricity, schools, roads etc., will be arranged on this land and plots will be sold to persons interested in constructing houses. It necessary, the land will also be sold on an installment basis. Town Planning In order to develop the city areas in Kathmandu Valley, a master plan of Kathmandu and Patan is under preparation. Master plan for neighboring cities will also be prepared during the plan period. On the basis of such plans, steps will be undertaken to improve the city area of the Kathamndu Valley. Building Construction Since adequate facilities are not available for officers and the living quarter of government servants in the various districts, office buildings, living quarters for government servants, guest houses for tourists and inspection teams, jails, police officers etc., in various districts will be constructed. A laboratory will also be constructed during the plan period by the Building Department of HMG to test construction materials. Statistics The first crude population census was taken in Nepal before the time of the first Rana Prime Minis ter, Jung Bahadur, more than a century ago. Since 1911, enumeration has been attempted at approximately ten years intervals. Nevertheless, it was not until 1952-1954 that the first population census was conducted along modern lines. Shortly thereafter, the need for various kinds of data for the development of the country was realized. The Department of Population Census was dissolved and the present Central Bureau of Statistics was formed in 1958 under the Nepal Statistics Act. In view of the limited resources and experience available in the country, the full use of trained manpower and available resources could not be mobilized in all of the fields of statistical study. Over the past five years, however, the situation has begun to improve. A Census of Population was conducted in 1961 and a Census of Agriculture in 1962. The first estimate of national income of Nepal for the year 1961-62 was also completed. In the field of industrial data, a list of existing industries has been prepared and published. In addition, various, indexes and other miscellaneous data have also been collected and published. The Third Plan The main objective of this plan is to make basic data on Nepal available to individuals and organizations belonging in both the private and public sectors. Instead of merely collecting basic data on population, agriculture, industries, etc, an aim of the Plan is to publish information on industries and commerce which will help to determine the social as well as economic activities of the people. The following activities have been included in the Third Plan: Population Census The preliminary report of the 1961 Population Census has been published. The detailed report will be published in 1965. The next Census of Population will be conducted in 1971; hence preparatory steps will be taken between 1965 and 1970 Agricultural Census The detailed report of the Agricultural Census of 1962 will be published. Sample surveys of crop production will be conducted each year and published. Similarly, livestock data will be collected on a sample basis from time to time. Industrial Survey With an aim of collecting data regarding industrial output and other related information in Nepal, an Industrial Survey will be conducted every year. This survey will also encompass small industries scattered throughout the country. Domestic Trade Since the present knowledge about domestic trade is very limited, a survey will be made to collect necessary data regarding important trade centres. Vital Statistics The collection of Vital Statistics will be started first in the major cities. Within the plan period, all cities in Nepal will be included. Later, this activity will be extended gradually to the whole country. Price Statistics The collection of price data and the calculation of price indexes for both the Terai and Kathmandu regions will be continued. More commodities and place will be covered to make it more comprehensive. Family Budget Survey The present family budget survey of certain area in Kathmandu will be gradually extended to cover Bhaktapur, Lalitput and some cities of the Terai as well. National Income Miscellaneous Statistics on foreign trade, aviation, railways, road transport and education will also be colle cted systematically and published. Administration of the Central Buresu will be reformed and improved. Modern equipment will be arranged to process the survey result quickly and efficiently. Necessary data with regard to the volume of water flow in various major and small rivers of Nepal will be made available form these stations. Ground Water During the plan period, surveys will be made to determine the possibility of using ground water in the Kathmandu Valley and Terai Region. Quality Sampling Nineteen ground water sampling stations and 40 sediment sampling stations will also be established. Forecasting Station Seventy stations will be established to collect rainfall, temperature and other weather data. During the Plan period, weather forecasting will be introduced. Organization Four zonal level offices will be set up to supervise workers in various areas. One central laboratory will be established to analyze the quality an the volume of water. Chapter XXIX Administrative Reform The speed of economic development does not only on capital and labour, but also upon Government administrative capacity. Since His Majesty’s Government must bear a major responsibility for achieving rapid economic development of the nation, necessary improvements in the organization and operation of all aspects of government must be implemented. Administrative improvement was stressed in the Second Plan and, as a result, considerable progress was made. Training facilities have been made available at several levels of government service. New methods and techniques of administration were introduced. Better performance, particularly by staff at the lower levels, has been achieved. Many accountants serving in all ministries and departments were trained under the Accountant Training Programme in order to maintain accounts are accordance with up-to-date procedures. Now procedures in budgeting and fund releases were helpful in effective execution of developmental activities. In spite of these achievements, further changes in the administrative system are necessary for the successful implementation of the Third Plan and of subsequent plans. In view of the increasing volume of work in ministries and departments, the creation of new section and sub-sections and the appointment of new staff continuous improvement in administrative regulations and organization s administrative regulations and organization are required. As such, the study of departmental organization and recommendations for improvement various public sector industries must also be properly managed and guidance provided the private sector. The latter activities differ from the general activities of Government administrative: Thus study and analysis are necessary. In order to meet these diverse requirements, the following steps will be taken: Reform is General Administrative In the third Plan, the goal will be to create and effective and efficient administrative structure in the entire government. Under this training programme, government servants will be made aware of the importance of modern administration, administration relating to manpower, administrative procedures, budget, statistics, planning, etc. This also requires reform in staff appointment and promotion policies. Necessary changes will be effected in the civil servant enlistment procedures. Existing personal policies and management are out of date and cannot cope with future needs. Hence, during the Plan period, consideration will be given to thee creation of a separate unit to strengthen and reorganize matters relating to personnel management. Administrative Procedures With the expansion of government activities, daily administrative procedures become more cumbersome. In order to make the procedures simple and yet effective, corresponding methods and filing systems will be studied and improved as required.special effort will be made to avoid unnecessary paper work, and to define staff responsibility and authority in a manner consistent with the functions of various administrative units . Maintenance of Equipment As administrative procedures are modernized, use of office machines is also increasing. Thus a central unit will be created for maintenance and repair as well as to provide spare for the equipment. Accountant Training One of the major factors in administrative organization at present is an advisory staff to assist high level officials in the various ministries. Such units could be effectively used in studying and providing recommendation on training, reform in administration, personnel management, data collection and related subjects. Therefore, efforts will be made during the plan period to provide an advisory staff to each ministry. Administrative Reform in the Industrial Sector Requisites for and efficient industrial administrator are different from the requirement for a general administrator. The smooth functioning of industries requires, in addition to general administrative knowledge, the knowledge of marketing, account ting, labour and related factors. Such knowledge of is every limited in the industries of Nepal which were in their initial stages of development. Nance, special attention will be given to this matter during the Plan period. In meeting short term requirements, shorts period training will be provide within the country, and industrial inspection tours in neighboring countries will be arranged so that industries in both the public and private sector will be run efficiently. For the long term, more persons will be given specialized training. These people will be sent abroad for higher educational training. Customs and Taxation Administration In order to adequately finance developmental activities, mere passing of various taxation laws will not be sufficient; rather the government will have to increase its sources of income. Taxes must be assessed on a scientific basis and condition created of their regular collection. Therefore, steps will be taken during the Plan period to improve the customs and taxation procedures of His Majesty’s Government. Since training is the given necessary training. Office builds will be provided in districts where there are no customs and taxation offices art present . CHAPTER XXX Sports As compared to other developing countries, Nepal is far behind in the field of sports also. After the political change of 1950 the Nepalese have shown their interest in sports by organizing various national sports organizations and national competitions. Moreover, Nepalese sportsmen have started taking part in international competition. Nepal participated for the first time in the 1964 world Olympic Games held in Tokyo, In spite of these efforts, significant progress has not yet been achieved. It would not be unfair to say that in recent years the general standard of sports in Nepal has been rather discouraging. One of the main reason for the current state of sports is the black of adequate encouragement provided by the government in this filed. Some steps were proposed to develop the sports during this plan. But these steps were not implemented. Therefore, during this Plan period, every effort will be made to attract the interest of the people in the field of sports. To achieve this goal, the National Council of Health and sports will be activised. In addition, programmes programmes on sports and physical education under the direction of the Education Ministry will be launched to popularize sports at the School and college level. Construction of one stadium, one auditorium and one swimming pool, which were already planned in the Second Plan, will be undertaken during this Plan period. Implementation CHAPTER XXXI Improvements in Organization and management In implementing any plan, very efforts must be made to anticipate difficulties and to take steps to remove them. Although it is recognized that not all of the problems can be anticipated, there are a number of areas which clearly need attention and improvement. A few of the most critical will be discussed below. Annual Plans and the Development Process Implementation of the Five year necessarily takes places on a periodic basis through annual budgeting. Annual programmes must be submitted and incorporated in the development budget. In the submission, quarterly work programmes must be included. Because annual budgets reflect the financial resources available at the time of preparation, they cannot be fully implementation Annual plans must further take into account manpower, materials and other resources available. Targets for each yea, moreover, should be specified within the framework of the Five Year, Plan targets. Coordination if interrelated plans must be achieved in an annual basis as well. Project Preparation The successful formulation and implementation of any development plan depends heavily upon careful study and preparation of project and programme proposals. Unless projects are based upon a thorough study of all of the factors involved and prepared with a realistic time perspective, their implementation will run into difficulties and delays which will adversely affect development performance. Further-more, projects in such areas as irrigation and power must be selected from among a variety of alternative possibilities. Unless careful analysis takes place, the projects included in the plan may not be the ones which would provide maximum to the nation. Coordination at the local level Coordination of development activities is necessary at all levels, national, district and local, if available resources are to be most effectively utilized. Poor coordination results in scarce technically trained manpower being less than optimally utilized. Activities are delayed because of shortage of construction materials, and duplication of effort occurs. Limited coordinative efforts art the local levels have been made by district governors and other local officials. His majesty’s Government has adopted a decentralization policy which should make it possible to effectively coordinate activities at the local levels. Progress Reports An effective reporting system is necessary to keep abreast of the progress of development activities. In order to assure prompt corrective action when and where difficulties arise, review of many projects can be undertaken at the zonal level. Decentralization The importance of the panchayat system in securing mass support for national and local development programmes and the need for decentralization to further generate support have already been mentioned. In order to generate greater public support, to coordinate loc level activities and to effectively implement plans, more responsibility needs to be given the 3,600 village, 75 district and 14 zonal panchayats. During the Plan period, with the implementation of decentralization, greater authority will be given the local and district panchayat. The development of health, education, agriculture, roads and similar functions at the local level will be shifted gradually to the district panchayats. The district will, in turn, delegate many of these functions to the village panchayats. In order to achieve the objectives of decentralization, distr5ict administration will be reorganized and staff upgraded and given the necessary training. In order to ensure the successful implementation of decentralization, the steps must be carefully planned and actual achievements kept under continuous review. The decentra lization progrmme will therefore be undertaken in three phases. Greater power will be given the districts panachayats as the programme advances through the three phases. These have been identified as preliminary transitional and permanent. Preliminary Phase The purpose of the preliminary phase is to establish the administrative and organizational relationships necessary at the district level. The present Dichotomy between 75 separately demarcated panchayat districts and 35 administrative districts will be eliminated. The present situation is responsible for considerable confusion and overlapping responsibilities. In its place, 75 district administrative officers will be appointed, one for each panchayat district. This officer will take over the responsibilities presently given to district governors and Panachayat development officer. The district officer will be responsible to the central government through the zonal administration. Transitional Phase In the transitional phase various programmes presently operated from the centre will be transferred to the district pancahayats. In addition, all central department personnel operating at the district level will be taken into the administrative and technical staff of the district panchayats. The central department will work through the district officers rather than directly as in the past. Personnel required for the third phase will be hired and given training in the Second phase. Under the third phase, effective district administrative structure will be established and staffed with well- trained personnel. All district level activities except the maintenance of law and order will be under district panchayat authority. Under this phase, local development within the guidelines set by the national government will be the responsibility of the district and village panchayats. The following will be undertaken lat the village panchayat level: 1. Cadastral survey and maintenance of records on land ownership, tenancy, etc. 2. Provision of production credit to tillers, marketing of agricultural products through the establishment of multipurpose cooperative societies 3. Provision of agricultural extension services, in order to improve agricultural practices and increase output. 4. Land revenue collection, following the abolition of the zamindar system. 5. Operation and expansion of primary education. 6. Provision of local health centres. 7. Construction and maintenance of minor irrigation works Because of the costs and trained manpower required, all villages cannot be covered by permanent decentralization during the Third Plan. In the first year, the permanent phase will be implemented in a few village pancahayats in selected districts and gradually expanded in coverage over time. The activities will be handled by the administrative staff of the village pancahayats and the cooperative societies. Those decentralized activities which cannot be effectively decentralized further to the village level will be handled by the district organization. Examples are land administration, agricultural industry development. Moreover, the preparation of the annual and periodic Plans for the district will be done art the district panchayat level, which formulating such plans, the district panchayat will take into account of activities of the village panachayats. Implementing different phases of decentralization It is desirable to execute the different phases of decentralization in a planned way. The implementation of decentralization needs sufficient economic resources, training and supervision, hence it should be extended gradually. Actually the programme of permanent phase will be implemented in one district. It will then be possible to expand this to other districts on the basis of experience gained. The different stages of decentralization will be executed in the Plan period as given below. Under the decentralization programme, the zonal commissioners will have authority for the following: 1. Maintenance of law and order within the zone. 2. Coordinated of activities of the various central departments. 3. Supervising the work of the chief District officers as it relates to His Majesty’s government and providing necessary guidance. The number of workers engaged on development projects in 1964-65 is estimated at 50,000. Among these were the Trisuli Hydel, the Khageri Irrigation, the Kathmandu Drinking water and the Sonauli-Poklhara road projects. The bulk of the labour supply consists of cultivator on a part-time basis. Problems of instability of supply result since the workers leave to return to their farms at planting and harvest times. No large group of workers as yet treats construction work as permanent employment. Steps must be taken to attach the present workers more or less permanently to the non-agricultural sector. Among the steps to be taken to meet problem are: 1. To establish an agency to mobilize labour, to administer labour welfare measures and to train workers. 2. To opened employment exchanges in major district centres 3. To provide living quarter and fair price shops in large project area. 4. To provide health and education facilities near major project site. 5. To resettle workers in area near construction projects. 6. To establish pioneer groups for development projects. In this effort, close contact will be maintained with the panchayats and class organizations. Effort will also be made to utilize retired, military personnel in these activities. Mobilize training terms will train construction workers. Construction Materials Of the total Plan expenditures, it is estimated that some 45 per cent or Rs 1,000million will be sent on construction. Although the above figures may appear to be excessively high in the light of past experience, these quantities are required to implement the development projects. During the Second Plan, for example, 100,000 tons of cement was used. By comparison, the 570,000 tons for the Third Plan may appear too high, but more and larger projects requiring cement have been included in the Third Plan. During the Second Plan, 15,000 tons of iron rods and 16,000 bundles of corrugated sheets were used. During the Third Plan 70,000 tons of iron rods and 100,000 bundles of corrugated will be needed. The National Trading Corporation will be responsible for importing the bulk of these supplies. Nepal has a substantial volume of timber resources. The present sawmilling capacity is some 17010 thousand cubic feet per year. The Timber Corporation of Nepal plans to increase its capacity by some 5 lakh cubic feet during the Third Plan. By 1970, total production capacity in Nepal is expected to rise to 3000 cubic feet per year. Therefore, 6,500,000 cubic feet estimated requirement can be easily met. Brick production presently is wholly on a village industry basis. Data on brick production capacity are not available. Strong steps must be taken to expand brick production to meet the requirement. A brick and tile factory will be established in Kathmandu with as annual capacity of 30 million bricks and 2.5 million tiles. Aside form these construction materials, lime, glass and other components are also required. Heavy equipment requirement will be estimated and steps taken to ensure an adequate supply. Among these are the East- West Highway, the Sonaul-Pokhara Road, the Trisuli Hydel Project the Chatra Cannel and the Kathmandu – Kodari Road. India, the USSR, China, the United States and other nation will be providing a part of their assistance in this fashion. Transportation It is essential to provide transport in order to have materials available for the smoother execution of development activities in the public and private sectors. In the past Plans, many targets could not be achieved because of transportation bottleneck. Even to-day, scheduled arrival of materials as regard is major problem. The estimated materials requirements for the Third Plan for cement, iron, corrugate sheets and timber are 5,70,000 tons, 100,000 bundles and 6,600,000 cubic feet respectively. This corporation will work on behalf of the various projects and help to clear the foods from Calcutta port. Even in kathmandu Valley, which has good transport connection with India, there were storages of supplies during the Second Plan because of transport limitations. In 1965-66, an average of 700 tons of goods per day is expected to move into Kathmandu. This is expected to rise to 1,000 tons per day by 1970. This total includes all goods, not just construction materials. The elimination of transport bottlenecks is essential not only to ensure a smooth flow a\\\\of material to development projects but also to help stabilize market price in the Valley. The condition of the Raxaul-Amlekhgunj railway is very critical. It can no longer be depended upon as a reliable means of transport but should be used to the maximum extent possible. The Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway started operation in April. 1964 and has been working only one shift carrying an average of 200 tons per day. In the first year of the Third Plan, the ropeway operations will be expanded to three shifts (24 hours) with a capacity of 600 tons daily. For, this, the job training programme has been under way and will be completed in the First year of the Third Plan. The Nepal Transport Corporation will utilize the Raxaul-Amlikhgunj railway, 300 trucks and the ropeway to transport 1000 tons of goods per day from Birgunj to Kathmandu. CHAPTER I Objectives and Politics: Economic development is a continuing process. The country has acquired several years of experience in the management of development programmes. Future development will be built upon the foundation of economic and social achievements of this period. Since most of the resources to be available for the Fourth Plan will be needed for completing existing projects begun during the earlier Plans, it is imperative that we consolidate the continuing projects rather then involve evident that our major effort during the Plan period will be directed to ward furthering the successes of past planning, thereby providing new impetus to future developmental activities. The success of the Fourth Plan will depend in large measure upon the amount of investment drawn out of available resources for various development programmes and projects. The objectives of these programmes and projects must be consistent with sectoral objectives based upon the framework of national goals and policies. However, this should be done without losing the essential harmony between the two. Investment resources available for development programs and projects during the Plan period will be guided by the following objectives. Since the desirable goals of national development are numerous, it would not be possible either to spell them out or to fulfill them all at once. However, some basic objectives which are consistent with the Panchayat System and the guiding principles of the Constitution and of highest priority are as follows: 1. To maximize output: Increase of public welfare is co-terminus with a higher level of economic development which, in turn, results in increased production. In order to end economic exploitation, suitable changes in the system and organization of both distribution and exchange should accompany increases in production. Since the dangers of exploitation and undue economic pressure are great  in a poverty stricken society like ours, our initial effort must strike at the very root of poverty. Since low productivity is the root cause of poverty, in order to create a society free from exploitation, it is first necessary to increase production to maximum extent. This objective is essential, not only from the point of view of modernizing our economy on  a sound basis, but also from the point of view of inspiring public confidence in the development efforts by providing tangible improvement in the work-a-day lives of the people. Due to lack of necessary data, it is not possible to calculate the actual rate of growth of gross domestic product during the Fourth Plan period. However, on the basis of the data that was available during the drafting of the Fourth Plan, the proposed investment and projects to be  completed during the Plan period are likely to generate an increase in GDP of 4% per annum during the Plan period. ): The building of infrastructure like transport, communications, and electricity warrants great attention in the preliminary phases of development because it helps to accelerate development, as well as helps to equally distribute produced goods. It is equally necessary to provide a base for the long-term development, as well as to provide minimum increases in the living standard of the people. While selecting projects and programmes for investment in the Fourth Plan, effort has been made to strike a balance between the two objectives: to increase per capita income by immediate increases in production and to build the necessary base for long-term development. 3. To expand and diversity international trade : Because Nepal is land-locked and lacks long experience in foreign trade, expansion and diversification of international trade have become major goals of economic development. With a desirable expansion and diversification of export trade, our economic growth would gather momentum and our capacity to import the essential materials needed for development would be enhanced. Economic relations between Nepal and India will continue to remain close, nevertheless, diversification of Nepal’s foreign trade is essential because sole dependence on a single country undesirable from an economic point of view. 4. To secure accelerated pace of development with maximum economic stability by controlling price level: Economic development and stability should be considered together in order to avoid any adverse effect of development which might result in the economy. Hence economic stability along with economic development should be regarded as an additional goal. During the Fourth plan period, it will be essential to maintain general economic stability by control of the price level and improvement in the terms of international trade. Economic stability is not limited to price stability. Rather, it would encompass all the economic policies adopted by the government in keeping with the aims and objectives of the Plan. Hence, it is essential that economic stability is maintained for the steady growth of the economy. 5. To make effective use of manpower resources and to control population growth: While setting the goals of economic development, it has become necessary to consider the effective utilization of available manpower resources and the control of population growth within desirable limits. Although the rate of growth of population in Nepal appears to be low in comparison with the growth rate of in many other countries, it is not a desirable rate in relation to available resources, especially cultivable land. The family planning programme will help improve the situation and thereby uplift the standard of living of the people. At the same time, the objective of maximum use of manpower  resources will also be fulfilled. More over, during the Plan period, increases in agricultural productivity and in private and public investment in the industrial trade, and construction sectors will result in a considerably more effective utilization of the labour force. In order to transfer surplus man-power on a large scale from agriculture to non-agricultural sector, it requires diversification in the structure of the national economy. Obviously it will not be possible to achieve this within the short period of five years. 6. To create conditions conducive to the emergence of a society free from exploitation: The Panchayat System has envisaged a social order which is free of undue economic exploitation of individuals or class by any other individual or class. Truly speaking, the five year period of the Fourth Plan will be too short to fulfill the long-term goals of the system. It is, however, important that the programmes of each development plan are designed to push the country towards that ultimate goal. It was for the purpose of social justice and economic progress that the land reform, ‘Mulki Ain’ (code of civil and criminal laws) was adopted and that the development programme in agriculture, industry, education, health, and roads were implemented on a county-wide basis. In the Fourth Plan period these programmes will continue to expand in order to consolidate the base for the establishment of a society free from exploitation. Regarding policies to achieve the above mentioned national objectives, the following factors will definitely get due consideration: 1. Mobilization of internal resources: It is imperative that the rates of investment are capital formation be increased to the maximum possible extent in order to accelerate the pace of development and to create the required infrastructure. Obviously, availability of investment capital is essential. Although foreign aid plays an important role in the Fourth Plan , increases in development expenditure are dependent upon mobilization of internal resources. This is also essential in order to decrease the country’s dependence upon foreign aid. Timely steps on the part of the Government would include increases in taxation as well as austere measures regarding recurring expenditures. It has been observed that the public sector and commercial organizations should also contribute to the \\xa0 mobilization of internal resources. The policy should be aimed at encouraging the private sector to save more from its additional income, as well as making institutional reforms. In addition, the channels of investing the mobilized savings must be made more attractive and effective. There should be simultaneous changes in the investment pattern and diversion of resources into more productive sectors. In view of our present economic condition, emphasis must be placed on agriculture development so that maximum increase in production can be accomplished even while utilizing limited investment funds. Improvement in existing facilities, rather than establishment of new ones, is essential so that adequate assistance can be provided for development in other field. The tendency to increase expenditure in the social sector on education and health should not be encouraged. Greater emphasis will be made to re-enforce already existing facilities that to expand activities in this field. In the industrial sector, attention has to be  paid towards creating appropriate condition to attract private sector investment. In order to give impetus to agro-based industries in accordance with the objectives set forth in the Fourth Plan , the current policies will have to be reviewed and priorities (in industry) will have to be changed. In the transport and communications sector, the determining criteria for additional facilities should be linked directly to the needs of the various factorial programmes and to long-term development needs. Austerity has to be strictly followed in different sector, including building construction. Attention must be paid to inter-linked projects making sure that they are balanced since discrepancies in one sector may have adverse effects in another one. Due attention should also be paid to regional and different geographic interlinkages and balance. If this pattern is followed, maximum utilization of available resources can be ensured. 2. Concentration of limited resources: As limited resources scattered in different projects and programmes are not likely to be utilized in the optimum manner, they should be concentrated in those areas capable of creating maximum increases in production. The logic behind this is that the results of developments activities of some important sectors would create a favorable reaction and therefore create a viable base for future development. It has been observed that limited sources can be concentrated from an administrative view point as well. The policy of concentrating resources has been used for working out details concerning regional development in the Fourth Plan period. It has been agreed that the unequal level of development among the various regions must be narrowed down. The meaning of regional consideration in the Pla n is not that the development of all regions be the same. It is essential that attempts should be made to create a balance between national and regional development by the proper utilization of resources and the extension of the benefits of development work to as many different areas as possible. During the Fourth Plan period, efforts will be made to create growth centres for the selected regions. It is natural that certain regions will have greater potential for development due to geographical, economic and social factors. However, development of remote areas is to be kept in mind in order to enable the national economy to progress continuously. It is essential that the long-term policy be adopted for the development of hilly regions during the Fourth Plan in order to create a base for economic growth by providing work opportunities to the population of those areas with low levels of resources per capita. On the basis of this policy, attention will be focused on a unification of hilly areas and Terai areas by increasing economic relations which would result from the implementation of regional development plans. Accordingly, the selection of areas to initiate the regional development programme will be based on the existence of transportation and other facilities and the potential for their expansion. 3. Incentive for investment in private sector: The public sector has to play an active role in the economic development of countries in the preliminary stages of economic development. Although the policy of creating basic infrastructure is intended to provide incentives for investment in the private sector, if the provision  of such facilities does not result in increase in the quantity of productive investment the government will have to be active in directly establishing industrial projects. While doing so, there might arise problems relating to management and operation in such industries. If the management  of public sector industrial enterprises is not satisfactory, the consumers will suffer unwarranted difficulties. Consequently, there will be a substantial rate of decrease in governmental income which may further discourage the private sector. Nepal does not lack private capital, although it does lack opportunities for productive investment. After implementation of the land reform programme, capital in the hands of landlords has remained idle due to a lack of investment opportunities in the economic sectors. It is, therefore, necessary to work towards creating an environment favorable to industrial and business investment. The following measures shall be taken during the Fourth Plan period for the purpose of augmenting private sector investment: (a) Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) will be well organized and made more effective in its functioning; (b) Current industrial policies and priorities will be reviewed and the new priorities will be spelled out in clear terms according to the objectives of the Fourth Plan in order to encourage industries by providing incentives and necessary facilities; (c) The need for various kinds of trained manpower for future industrial development will be assessed and training programmes and facilities will accordingly be worked out; (d) Existing financial institutions will be encouraged to advance loans to those landlords willing to sell their lands to the tillers so that they may invest in selected industries; (e) Incentives will be given to financial institutions to help expand and develop the industries already established; (f) The policies and programmes of cottage and small scale industries’ development thus  far adopted shall be evaluated. Assistance and facilities to be provided by the government will be decided accordingly. For the last few years government has involved itself directly or indirectly in commercial activities for two obvious reasons: (a) to regularly provide consumable goods of adequate quantity at fair prices to the consumers, and (2) increase government revenue by earning a fair profit which can be invested on development works. Except for the above two reasons, government interference and competition with the private sector is undesirable. Nor should the government interfere in the private sector when it is operating within government regulations and in the social interest. This will be the guiding consideration for the government before it takes any commercial steps during the Fourth Plan period. In fact, the private and government sector are two integral parts of a single process, and economic development is heavily dependent upon the progress and contributions of both. 4. Trade policy: According to the obje ctives of the Fourth Plan to expand and diversify foreign trade, production of exportable goods will be stressed. Since processed goods fetch a higher price than unprocessed and raw goods, our efforts should be directed towards the establishment of agro- based industries. Results of trade talks with India, due to be concluded during 1970, and the subsequent trade treaty will be crucially important for the future expansion of Nepalese foreign trade. It is, therefore, necessary to determine now the priorities, on the basis of which, the trade relations with India should be discussed, as well as to review the economic relations of Nepal with India. Appropriate revision in the current bonus system shall also be made in order to promote  export trade. The foreign exchange policy to be defined in this context will also indicate the most favourable level of foreign currency reserves to maintain and the measures to better utilize our surplus reserves. In order to broaden the base of social justice and to lessen undue economic pressure during the Fourth Plan period, genuine peasants will be given the opportunity to increase \\xa0production by a more effective implementation of land reform programme. Due consideration will  also be given to the regulation of production costs and the quality of produced goods in the interest of pubic welfare. To enable a majority of the people to contribute to national production, small industries will be developed and extended in a well- organized way. Cooperatives will also be strengthened on a viable economic basis. Timely changes will also be made in the tax and land revenue systems of HMG in order to make them more just and equitable. According to the Panchayat System’s goal of enlisting greater cooperation of the people in the economic development of the country, attempts will be made more effectively to make involve Panchayats of various levels in the process of both plan formulation and implementation in order to make the participation of people in the local development work more active and dynamic. CHAPTER II PLAN OUTLAY & ITS ALLOCATION Review of the Third Plan: The Third Plan attempted to increase the Gross Domestic Product by 19 per cent. The Plan envisaged an outlay of Rs 2,500 million, of which Rs 1,740 million was the public sector share, with the panchayat sector and the private sector share receiving Rs 240 million and Rs 520 million respectively. In addition, the Plan also envisaged the provision of Rs 150 million of credit to the private sector through financial institutions in the public sector. Compared to the above investment target, it is estimated that the actual development expenditure in the public sector during the Plan period would be Rs1,780 million .This figure is based on the actual expenditure in the first three years of the Plan period , the revised estimate of 1968-69 and the original budget estimate of 1969-70 . The details of public sector expenditures are given in Table 1. Although the above expenditure were incorporated into the development budget, they also include regular expenditures. It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain the amount of ‘actual’ development expenditure incurred during the Plan period .In accordance with the newly adopted classification system (of regular and development expenditure) followed by the Ministry of Finance on the advice of the National Planning Commission, the actual development expenditure for the Third Plan period will be only Rs 1,420 million. This estimate is based mainly upon the analysis of the budget for the year 1968-69. The development expenditure under the traditional and new classification is indicated in Table 2. The above table reveals that during the Third Plan period development expenditure in the public sector, under the new classification, is Rs 360 million less than development expenditure under the prevailing system. When the increase in national output is compared to the expenditure, it becomes necessary to determine the volume of the actual capital investment out of such increase. Accordingly, provisions for preparing the development and regular budgets (according to the new classification) shall be made. The details of this are shown in Annex 2. Priority of the Fourth Plan: In conformity with the objectives and policies of the Fourth Plan, priority has been given to the continuing projects, which were started during the Third Plan period or to those projects related to foreign aid. With the objectives of producing more within a short period of time and the creation of the infrastructure for accelerating the process of economic development in the future, priority has been given to the development of basic sectors like transport and communications during the Fourth Plan period. The lack of transport and communications has become the main deterrent to accelerating the process of economic development. No large scale development in the agricultural and industrial sectors is possible without adequate communications facilities. Therefore, as some new projects essential for regional development have to be planned along with the uncompleted projects started during the Third Plan period, the greater portion of expenditure in the public sector has been envisaged for the development of transport and communications facilities. More than 93 per cent of the manpower in Nepal is engaged in agriculture. Agricultural development is, therefore, very important and the improvement of the standard of living of the majority of the people is possible only by increasing agricultural production. Increased food production is essential for accelerating the speed of development and to eliminate the deterrents to development. Agricultural products also provide the raw materials required for various industries. In view of these factors the agricultural development programme has occupied an important place in the Plan. Inorder of priority, industry is third after transport and agriculture. Although the main responsibility for developing industries falls upon private sector, His Majesty’s Government may involve itself when the private sector is unable to develop certain basic industries. During the Fourth Plan period, firm reform measures will be undertaken for the reinforcement of industries that have already been established in the public sector. Although it is desirable to expand such services as education, health etc., the improvement and strengthening of existing facilities, rather than expansion of them, has been considered more appropriate during the Plan period because of increasing expenditures in this sector. Expenditure Required for the Fourth Plan: With regard to the above mentioned priorities and the fulfillment of the objectives and programs of the various sectors, the total expenditure planned is Rs 3,540 million. The estimated breakdown by sectors is as follows: Expenditure in Public Sector: Out of the total expenditure of the Fourth Plan, the estimated expenditure envisaged for the public sector is Rs 2,550 million. Also, His Majesty’s Government will make available Rs 20 million as a development grant for the panchayat sector. Thus His Majesty’s government will allocate Rs 2,570 million for the development budget of the Fourth Plan. Considering the objectives and the amount allocated in the public sector, the average annual expenditure comes to be 500 million of rupees. It shows a significant increase when compared with the annual expenditure of Rs 290 million during the Third Plan period under the new classification of development expenditure. The estimated expenditure for FY 1970-71 is Rs 450 million. Besides, if the proposed reforms in the administrative machinery materialize thereby making it more organized and systematic, the chances of successfully implementing the increasing numbe r of projects will improve. A detailed statement of the resources available, from both domestic and external sources, to meet the specified expenses in the public sector has been given in the chapter dealing with ‘Financial Resources’. Expenditure in Panchayat Sector: CHAPTER III FINANCIAL RESOURCES f Rs 3540 million required for achieving the goals of the Fourth Plan, His Majesty’s Government must provide Rs 2570 million: i.e. Rs 2550 million for the development of the public sector and Rs 20 million for the development of the panchayat sector. Based on potential available resources and the efforts for providing additional resources to meet the minimum requirements of development, the outline of the Plan has been prepared and the goals have been determined accordingly. Therefore, assuming that the government policy of mobilizing resources may change and in fact, recognizing the necessity of changing and improving that policy, the resources which can and should be made available have been provided in the Fourth Plan. In the foregoing chapter, the available resources for achieving the specified goals in both the private and panchayat sectors have been analyzed, and it has been shown that the required resources will be available. Public Sector In the process of economic development it is necessary to think of the maintenance of a fiscal balance between resources and investment as an objective of planning. But, giving due consideration to the minimum requirements, if the available savings for investment is insufficient to accelerate development activities, the possible impact of such an imbalance on the physical system should also be considered. But due to a lack of data on the national income and balance of payments, it is natural that the necessary information of savings and investments is also not available. Therefore, with the view of maintaining of financial balance in the fiscal system on the basis of available data, the estimate of financial resources potentially available for the public sector has been made for the Fourth Plan period. Estimation of resources which may be available in the public sector during the Fourth Plan period has been based on the following factors: changes in the government revenue and regular expenditure during preceding years; the possible changes in the future; assumptions concerning the proper utilization of foreign exchange; projected national and foreign credit; and the level of deficit financing which can be tolerated without adversely effecting the fiscal system by increasing the politically practical tax burden. I accordance with the long-term objective of accelerating development activities and gradually reducing the dependence upon foreign aid, efforts are being made to reduced the foreign aid ratio in the Fourth Plan. Following are the summary of the resources: a. Revenue surplus: The estimated revenue of Rs 430 million for the FY 1969-70 shows an annual increase of 5 per cent in revenue during the Fourth Plan period. During the seven years between FY 1963-64 to FY 1969-70 total revenue increased at the rate of 19 per cent per annum. Such a significant increase was made possible primarily because of periodic increases in various taxes and not because of improved tax administration. The development of the general fiscal system has also helped increase revenue. As such, while estimating the rate of increase in future revenue separate analysis should be made of the development of the fiscal system and of the increases in the rate of taxation in order to determine their relative importance in the overall increase in revenue. During the above mentioned seven years, the impact of development itself is responsible for no more than an annual 8 per cent increase in revenue. In fact, the increase in prices during that period seems to be a contributing factor to the increased revenue. Assuming fixed prices, it seems that general development has contributed to the increased revenue by 4 per cent annually. Therefore, considering the estimated revenue of Rs 430 million in FY 1969-70, the increase in revenue during the Fourth Plan period will be 5 per cent per annum, assuming fixed prices. There are several factors which might reduce the increase of revenue to less than 5 per cent. While difficult to quantify, some of these factors are: (1) while considering the price index for agricultural production in India, the export sector cannot made its complete contribution to the nation al income of Nepal, and thereby creates possible difficulties in increasing revenue from other sectors. (2) In the same way, increases in revenue are adversely affected by regulations concerning the gift parcel system. However, the favorable impact of economic development on revenue resulting from the proposed increases in investment during the Fourth Plan period should also be considered. At the recommendation of the National Planning Commission, the Finance Ministry will adopt a new classification of regular and development expenditures. According to the new classification system, some of the amounts under the development budget heads will come under regular budget heads. The difference between the current system and the new classification system may be shown on the basis of FY 1968-69. According to the prevailing prices, regular expenditures seem to have increased by 12-13 per cent per annum during the seven year period from FY 1963-64 to FY 1969-70. But according to the fixed prices of FY 1963-64, the increase has been only 10 per cent. According to the fixed prices of FY 1969-70, it is estimated that regular expenditures shall increase by 10 per cent during the Fourth Plan period. To achieve this, emphasis should be given to administrative efficiency and frugality. Generally, salaries and allowances constitute the largest share of regular expenditure. Based on the statements given above, total revenue shall be Rs 2,490 million and total regular expenditure shall be 2,160 million during the Fourth Plan period. b. Additional revenue from the tax changed: Increase in revenue, due to changes in the rate of the prevailing taxes, may be more difficult to achieve during the Fourth Plan. Because of increases in custom duties, income tax and sales tax during recent years, the opportunity for increasing revenue by changing the rate of taxation seems very limited. If the minimum resources required for development were not made available through internal resources (by changing existing rates of taxation and by making tax administration more efficient), it is clear that the pace of development would be affected adversely and Nepal’s dependency upon foreign aid would increase. From economic and technical points of view, agriculture may make a great contribution to increase revenue. However, the current land tax sys tem should be changed scientifically in order to make it just. The working efficiency of government-owned industrial, financial and business institutions should be improved and operated more frugally, thereby contributing to increases in revenue. Therefore, along with the changes in the prevailing rate of taxation and improvements in tax administration, the earnings, from better operated government-owned corporations, will be Rs 300 million , which will also be available for the Fourth Plan . 150 million should be collected during the Fourth Plan period. Considering the present situation of financial institutions in the public sector (like commercial banks, insurance corporation, provident fund etc. ), it seems possible to collect Rs 150 million or more from the domestic loan. It is not the collection of the loan, but the extent to which government can bear the burden of future credit and the expenditure required to provide resources from other sources in comparison to domestic credit which are the factors determining the quantity of domestic credit. The study of savings which can be invested at present reveals that the terms and interest of the prevailing loans have made domestic credit relatively more expensive from the government viewpoint. Consideration should be given to provide resources from deficit financing instead of domestic credit. Although the possibility of providing development funds from deficit financing is limited, such provision, within certain limits, can reduce government liabilities to a great extent. d. Deficit financing: In order to mobilize resources for development of the public sector during the  Fourth Plan , Rs 200 million of deficit financing is projected. Assuming a general balance of the resources required and available in the private sector, the situation of the fiscal system shall have been determined from the resources and this will be available in the public sector. In fact, the study on savings in commercial banks and other government institutions reveal that more resources have become available in the private sector. So, if the expenses in the public sector were to be met through revenue and domestic loan, one should agree that financial balance has existed likewise and one should agree on the balancing nature of the investment through foreign aid available in the form of goods or in services. Now, considering the optimum relation that should exist between savings and investment, the extent of investment by deficit financing has to be determined. The result of the investment by deficit financing, the adverse impact on the price and the balance of payment of the country has generally determined the limit of deficit financing. Deficit financing is one of the numerous causes of inflation. As the proposed deficit financing will reduce the reserve of convertible foreign exchange and will be spent at the same ratio for importing physical resources for development, there is no possibility that adverse effect on the internal price situation will be caused. One of the main causes of monetary inflation during the past years has been the continuous increase in foreign exchange expected to be earned during the past years, the Fourth Plan period, the current savings, the quantity of the resources available from domestic sources, the minimum saving of foreign exchange required to increase foreign trade, the quantity of convertible foreign exchange in relation to the money supply, and the quantity of foreign exchange required for the development works in the public sectors during the Fourth Plan, the proposed deficit of Rs 200 million is necessary to accelerate development activities. e. Deficit: The resources available from domestic sources for operating various development projects  show a deficit of Rs 100 million. This deficit shall be met by the saving of foreign exchange, if possible . The estimates of resources reveal that the present savings of foreign currency is more than future requirements. However, the above savings can be spent only when foreign currency is in deficit. Otherwise, the required amount will have to be collected by the mobilization of domestic resources. f. foreign aid: During the Third Plan period, foreign aid amounted to Rs 950 million including both  loans and grants. The following table shows the actual amount received during the first three years of the Third Plan, the revised amount during the fourth year, and the estimated amount of the fifth year. The estimate of foreign aid during FY 1969-70 is considerably higher than in FY 1968-69. However, the actual amount seems not to have increased more than Rs 270 million. It is difficult to estimate beforehand the amount of expected foreign aid for the Fourth Plan . However, considering the experiences gained during the Third Plan period, the type of projects to be operated during the Fourth Plan period, and the quantity of domestic resources available for local expenses, estimated foreign aid for the Fourth Plan is expected to total Rs 1,490 million; Rs 1,290 million in the form of grants and Rs 200 million as loans. The following table shows the amount to be provided by HG for regular and development expenditures and the sources of each during the Fourth Plan period. The table gives a clear picture of the complete financial situation of the public sector and the relation between expenditure and resources during the Fourth Plan period. CHAPTER IV POPULATION AND MANPOWER The Growth in Population The first census of the Kingdom of Nepal was taken in the year 1911. Although an increase of only 3,841,650 persons or 68.12 per cent has been observed during the period between 1911 and 1961, this small increase might well be the result of the various natural calamities, the two world wars and the political upheaval in the country. However, the statistics of births and deaths made available from the census of 1961 shows a growth rate of 2.0 per cent annum. Though data on births and deaths (during a year preceding the census) were collected during the census of 1961, neither set of figures is reliable. The data on deaths seem particularly less reliable than on births. The total population recorded in the various censuses is shown in the table below: Estimated Population In the absence of the necessary reliable statistics of births and deaths, it is not easy to make population projections. It is possible to formulate informative and reliable estimates of national population trends only when reliable statistics of births and deaths and knowledge of the possible results of existing programmes effecting births and deaths are available. Due to a partial lack of the necessary information, it is natural to encounter difficulty in making a scientific study analyzing the population. However, estimates of the future population for the period between 1961 to 1981 have been prepared on the basis of the available statistics and assuming that the sex-age –adjusted birth rate of 40 per thousand will remain constant throughout the period of projection and that due to a decline in the death rate there will be an annual increase of 0.5 year in life expectancy. The expectation of life was estimated by comparing the age -specific death rates obtained from the census of 1961 and the population survey of 1963 to the age-specific death rates given in the United Nation’s Model Life - Tables. The estimated population thus obtained is given in Table 10. Estimated Population Growth From the above Table, the population is expected to increase by 863,537; 1,145,178 and 1,384,468 respectively each quinquennium beginning in 1961. In other words, the annual rate of population growth for different periods will be as follows: A difference has been observed between the rates of population growth shown in the above Table and those given in the population and Manpower Chapter in the Third Plan. This difference is due to the different methods employed in estimating future population. In the population chapter of the Third Plan, a very simple growth pattern for each quinquennium was assumed and then from the estimated total population, age composition figure (i.e. 0-14 years; 15-59 years and 60 years and over) were estimated. The present estimate, obtained by the Cohort Survival Method after a detailed analytical study of the available data on births and deaths, is definitely more reliable. The Age Composition of the Estimated Population As such, in a developing country like ours, the number foreign children aged 0-14 years constitute more than 40 per cent of the total population, while persons aged 60 years and over are around 5-6 per cent. But as has been stated above, any reduction in the birth rate require special efforts and a longer time. In spite of a Herculean effort, the birth rate tends toward neither its possible minimum nor its possible maximum. The birth rate of any country and of any time period is an expression of the culture of that particular population, tending towards a level which represents a balance of conditions that affect it both in a positive and negative sense. Thus, to bring a substantial change in the birth rate, the initial requisites are to bring required changes in the economic and social conditions, cultural patterns and aspirations towards life of the common man. The second need is to create an institution such as the family planning programme, which can sufficiently consolidate the successes brought through the above mentioned changes. Specifically, the density of population in Nepal is 173.2 persons per square mile. With regard to the physical geography, the amount of habitable land and the amount of land under cultivation in Nepal, the density of population seems to be quite high. The estimated density of population in various years is shown in the Table below: From the above Table, the population density of Nepal in the year 1961 was 173.2 persons per square mile and it is estimated that it will reach 253.5 persons per square mile in the year 1981. The estimated population density of the various regions is given in the Table below: From the above Table, the population densities of the Inner Terai region and the Western Terai region are found to be less in comparison with other regions. The density of population of Kathmandu Valley is very high comparison with other regions. Lalitpur and Bhakta pur are situated in this region, and it is natural that the density of population of this region would be higher than that of the other regions. At the same time, it is obvious that it will be more and more difficult to arrange necessary social and economical infrastructure (such as education, health, housing, culture and recreation) because of the increase in population. It seems desirable to launch a programme resettling some people from the highly densely populated region to the less densely populated regions, especially to the Far Western and Inner Terai regions. As has been stated above, facilities like education, health, housing, etc. and employment opportunities in various economically developed fields would be more difficult to provide with a high rate of growth in population. In comparison with the population of 1961, 2.5 million more people would be added to the 15-59 age –group by 1981. According to the prevailing economic conditions, there would be a substantial pressure of population on the land. If the estimated growth of population were to take place as mentioned above, it would be more and more difficult to fulfill the increasing needs in the field of education. In comparison with the year 1961, the number of children of school-age 6-11 years in the primary level would increase by 41,119 and the number of children of school-age in the middle level would increase by 25 per cent more and the more number in higher education would increase by 39 per cent in 1981. As shown by the census, in the year 1961, 48.5 per cent of the total population and 80. There should be ample opportunities for work in various new fields which should provide for a substantial growth of the labour force. The development of industries and occupations giving opportunities to housewives and students would allow them to become economically active, and therefore encourage the growth of the economically active population. Out of the total economically active population of 4,306,839, 4,040,607 are engaged in agricultural work. The census also showed that 30,365 are employing others, 3,193,207 are working for themselves, and 263,934 are working as unpaid family workers. Thus it is clearly shown that, although agriculture is the major occupation, it has not developed into a commercial industry and has instead retained its subsistence nature. Position in the Fourth Plan On the basis of the above analysis, the influences of various population groups expected during the Fourth Plan can be studied. The age group distribution of the population during the Fourth Plan is shown in the Table below: According to this Table, there is an increment of 196,677 children of school-going age (5-14 age group) during the Fourth Plan. At the end of the Third Plan, only 35 per cent of the children in this group had an opportunity to go to school. Judging from this information, the target of education, especially in the primary and middle levels, should be increased substantially. During the next five years, there should be an increase of 664,930 individuals in the labour force (the 15-59 age group). If not, the rate of employment will be even lower than during the Third Plan. In this estimate, the number of individuals who are under 15 and 59 years have not been included although they might actually be employed. In order to increase productivity in the labour force, this practices will be discouraged. Gradually the work done by people outside of the 15-59 age group will be taken over by the new labourers. If this were not done, the numbers of persons looking for jobs would continue to increase and would be higher than the above mentioned number. Also, if an ambitious plan could be formulated to activate the 1.14 million unemployed persons by the end of the Third Plan period, the number of persons depending on others for their subsistence would decrease and the standard of living of general people would actually increase. Industrial classification of the labour force shows the degree of dependency of the population upon different industries, as well as being a main measuring device to determine how much the country has developed. According to the national census taken in the year 1961, the economically active population was about 4.6 million, of which 93.83 per cent were dependent upon agriculture. No reliable statistics have yet been collected which can indicate the extent of change brought to the employment structure by economic development during the past nine years. As a result, the percentage of people who have shifted from agriculture to other industries is not known. Although reliable statistics on this question should be available from the national census to be held in 1971, there is little reason to believe that there has been any remarkable change in the industrial distribution of the labour force. This is because of the underdeveloped nature of the country and the fact that the rate of economic development has been minimal. Although it is likely that increased investment during the Fourth Plan period will result in effective utilization of the agricultural labour force, there is little likelihood that the desired change in the industrial structure of the non-agricultural sector will occur. Technical Manpower: At the base year of the Fourth Plan (1969 -70), the number of highly trained persons (graduates) in the technical and scientific fields such as engineering, health, education and commerce is estimated to be 2,897. The number of graduates in both technical and non-technical fields is estimated to be 7,648. Also, even those who complete their studies during the Plan period should be considered. Their number is expected to reach 2,364 by the fourth year of the Fourth Plan. The breakdown of the estimate is given in the following Table. During the last Plan period, several technical and vocational training centers were opened in order to provide middle and lower level technical facilities within the country. Some 1,000 Nepalese have received miscellaneous vocational and technical training during their service with the British-Gurkha Army which will also help to fulfill the need for technically trained manpower. The above description does not give us a very positive picture of the ratio between the higher level and the middle and the lower level technically trained persons available in the country. The number of lower and middle level trained persons is not adequate to help the higher level personnel function most effectively. This shows the need to put greater emphasis on the training of middle and lower level manpower. In the training centers of the country, duplication in training subjects, oversupply in certain trades, and scarcity in some others have also been evident. Thus, during the Fourth Plan period, efforts must be made to coordinate the training of personnel with the requirements for skilled manpower. In the health sector, the number of specialized doctors and well trained nurses falls short of those required. However, the number of indigenous health worke rs (i.e. Kabiraj, Vaidyas, etc.) could be fully mobilized, thereby increasing the number of facilities in the health services. The number of such indigenous health workers in the country is estimated to be around 200 at the present time. In the absence of some basic information, it was not possible to estimate scientifically the required technical manpower for the Fourth Plan period. If the higher level manpower available were to be used as a base, the number of middle and lower level persons required during the Plan period would be as follows: Training The first important goal to keep in mind when considering training during the Plan period is the elimination of duplication in training facilities. Expansion of such facilities should arise only in subjects which have been found to be absolutely essential. Experience in preceding years has shown that, when training was given in vocations with little demand, the trained persons remained unemployed and consequently caused a loss to the national wealth. Such wastage should be eliminated as soon as possible. To date higher level technical personnel have been trained outside the country under foreign assistance. In view of long- term requirements, such training facilities should be made available within the country. A medical college and an engineering college will be established during the Fourth Plan period. Graduates from these institutions can be utilized during the Fifth Plan period. In important vocations, facilities for the training of middle and lower level technical manpower will be expanded whenever necessary. However, the opening of new institutions will not be encouraged until a thorough study has been made regarding the types of manpower required and the means to fulfill these demands. Since on-the-job training of skilled workers and upgrading training programmes are more effective, such programmes will be implemented wherever necessary. Employment The employment of the labour force is a vital factor in a developmental plan. The main objective of economic planning should include the provision of employment opportunities to those looking for employment. According to the latest estimate, the number of persons of working age, i.e. between 15- 59 years, is 6,072,000. In the absence of any employment survey, it is difficult to ascertain the total unemployed population in the country. Distinguished unemployment is also visible in several areas. In the field of trained manpower, those who have received technical training have been able to find employment. However, surveys and studies have indicated that persons having non-technical or arts education are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable employment. Among the educated, the number of persons looking for non-technical jobs has increased tremendously. More suitable jobs will be required during the Fourth Plan period for the additional population that will join the labour force. Since most of the population is dependent upon agriculture for its livelihood, there is much under-employment in the country. If sufficient employment opportunities cannot be created for the increased labour force in the non-agricultural sectors, the unemployment problem might take an unpleasant trend. In view of constant progress in the field of education, the number of educated persons is expected to increase greatly. Although a number of development works have been undertaken in different sectors of the economy, there has been virtually no noteworthy change in the basic condition of agriculture. According to an estimate for 1967/68, agriculture accounts for 66 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product. It is estimated that more than 93 per cent of the total labour force of the country is engaged in agriculture. Besides, agricultural products are the major items in the export trade of the country. Of total exports, food grains alone constitute about 70 per cent. In spite of being predominantly an agricultural country, the level of land productivity is low. In addition, increased population is exerting heavy pressure on cultivated land, consequently giving rise to the critical problem of providing gainful employment to the growing labour force in agriculture. Under these circumstances emphasis needs to be given to transforming the tradition bound and largely monsoon based subsistence agriculture into a modern and commercial enterprise. Although the over-all targets of the agricultural programme are determined by the government, their fulfillment essentially depends on the contribution of all the farmers and families who are engaged in agriculture. The availability of basic agricultural inputs and services on the one hand and a just reward for their efforts on the other should be guaranteed to the farmers only in this context can the agricultural development programmes undertaken by the government be meaningful. Progress in the Agricultural Sector Agricultural development has been emphasized by the government since the First Plan period. As a result, adaptive research suited to the climatic conditions of the country has been conducted in different fields of agriculture. Results of that research found appropriate for adoption is disseminated to the farmers through the agricultural extension programme. In addition, a nationwide land reform programme has been implemented during the Second Plan period in order to bring about institutional changes in traditional agriculture. It is only in the Third Plan that the targets and programme of agricultural development have been fixed at the national level. It was envisaged in this Plan to increase production of food grains by 15 per cent and production of cash crops by 73 per cent. Accordingly production of food grains was to be increased from the estimated production of 3.27 million metric ton in 1964/65 to 3.77 million metric ton in 1969/70 and that of cash crops from 0.25 million metric ton in 0.39 million metric ton. In order to accomplish these targets, the need for improving farm practices has been stressed; and accordingly, programmes for increasing the use of inputs like improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation were incorporated into the Plan. A review of progress made in the four years of the Plan period shows that the production of food grains has increased by only 10 per cent. Looking at individual crops, the food grain production of wheat is far behind the target and all cash crops (except oil-seeds production) are far short of the targets. Production targets of different crops and  progress made in the first four years of the Third Plan period are shown in the following Table: It is clear from the above Table that the basic target of the Third Plan to increase production of food grains by 15 per cent will remain unfulfilled. This shortfall in production of food grains and other crops is mainly due to the absence of adequately organizational effort and necessary inputs. According to progress made during the last four years, the area and the use of chemical fertilizer is about 17 per cent of the target of the Third Plan. Similarly, progress in the field of irrigation is much below the target. Keeping in view the needs of agricultural development, several departments have been established in different fields of agriculture in order to conduct adaptive research which is suitable in different climate conditions of the country, on improved seeds of various crops, on livestock, and on fisheries, etc. and also to produce these inputs and make them available to a large number of farmers on a easy terms. Under these departments there are at present 4 Agricultural Research Situations, 4 Agronomy Farms, 23 Horticulture Development Centres, 4 Livestock Development Farms, 3 Poultry Hatcheries, 34 Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries, 3 cheese Factories, 1 Dairy Centre and 10 Fishery Centres located in different parts of the country. With an aim of establishing a close link between agricultural research and farmers, an agriculture extension programmes is being implemented under the supervision of graduate level Agriculture Development Officers posted in 43 out of 75 districts. In the field of training during the last four years, more then 800 J.T.As. have been trained and 1870 farmers have received practical training. An Agriculture College has been established to train higher level agricultural technicians inside the country. In addition, the Agricultural Development Bank, Land Reform Savings Corporation and Agricultural Supply Corporation have been established in order to provide credit, fertilizers, seeds, implements and other inputs to the farms. A Dairy Development Corporation has also been established to turn the dairy enterprise along business lines. A Minor Irrigation Department with the objective of developing irrigation facilities according to the needs of the agricultural development programmes has been established in the Ministry of Agriculture. A perusal of the progress made so far in the development of agriculture and its present  status shows that the use of such high yielding inputs as improved seeds and fertilizer and the provision of irrigation facilities are at a very low level. Out of 1,845,000 hectares of cultivated land, improved seeds have been used in only 102,630 hectares, and the annual use of chemical fertilizer ahs amounted to gross  24,000 metric ton. Similarly, irrigation facilities have been provided to 117,500 hectares which is only 6 percent of the total cultivated land. Furthermore, this includes minor irrigation from which it is naturally doubtful that permanent irrigation facilities will evolve. Although in the last four years institutional reforms have been introduced and at the same time several institutions have been established in the agricultural sector, much remains to be done to make them more effective. The agricultural development programme is at present beset by the following obstacles and constraints: (a) There is no firm support for augmenting production by means of identifying improved seeds of agricultural crops that are suitable for adoption in different climatic conditions of the country, producing them on an experimental basis for a given period of time, and supplying them to the farmers in an extensive way. (b) Allocated budgets are not efficiently utilized due to the absence of a well-organized administrative machinery. There is a need for the timely release of fund and the allocation of personnel on the basis of the approved programme. (c) At the Centre, there are separate departments looking after different activities in agriculture, but iner-departmental coordination and co-operation need to be mutually reinforcing.. similarly, at the district level each department has its own administrative offices. Even in a single agricultural station or farm there are separate administrative offices as in the center. But there is no office which is responsible for coordination, control and supervision. (d) At the village level, there is no administrative machinery other then some J.T.As, to look after agricultural extension and other development works. As a result, necessary inputs and services are not funneled effectively from the center to the village level and made available to the framers. In fact, the underlying objective of all the programmes undertaken by the government is to encourage and enable farmers to increase production. It is, however, not unnatural that the agricultural development programme of the government has failed to make its anticipated impact at the village level since there has not been an effective network reaching the farmers. (e) Projects and activities in agriculture are scattered over many areas, thus preventing projects and activities from being mutually reinforcing. There may be a branch office of the Agriculture Development Bank, but with poor support facilities. There may be an office of the Agriculture Supply Corporation, but with few or poor quality J. T. A’s. Research works are confined to the center or a few farms, and very little research has been adopted to local conditions. (f) A sense of responsibility is not acquired unless evaluation is based on the ability to implement specified programme in an efficient utilized. Similarly, the agricultural extension workers, who work at the village level, are not only inadequate in number, they are also poorly trained, lowly paid, and less experienced. (g) There is evidently duplication of effort, in the activities of the various government organizations in the field of agriculture. This has caused wastage of resources. None of these organizations have been able to function as an effective agent in the provision of credit and other inputs required for the development of agriculture. There is no system of supervised credit. Even more complex is the problem of collecting loans. To this end there is a need to ensure the availability of agricultural inputs on easy terms and also to fix on appropriate rent ceiling that would permit the actual farmers to receive a large art of the increased production. Moreover, no effort has been made so far to provide marketing and warehousing facilities. Objectives, Policies and Priorities of Agricultural Development in the Fourth Plan  Objectives: The agricultural development programme in the Fourth Plan will be geared to attain the following objectives through the maximization of output. This calls for increasing production of each crops, yields per land area & per capita yields: (a) To ensure rising levels of consumption; (b) To provide greater exports; (c) To supply an adequate amount of industrial raw-materials; In accordance with the above mentioned objectives and also on the basis of the present status of the agricultural sector, the policies adopted in the Fourth Plan for the agricultural development are the following: Accordingly the following modus operandi is adopted for the formulation of programmes: (a) First, the country will be delineated into major agricultural areas according to  potential for food grain production, cash crop production, livestock development and dairy products, horticulture production, fishery, etc., (b) Second, areas or districts for each line of production where concentrated efforts will be made for providing the services and inputs required to achieve the targets in each line of production will be selected. 2. The many activities for agricultural development, like extension, research irrigation etc. undertaken by the concerned departments of the Ministry of Food & Agriculture, will be coordinated and integrated to make them mutually reinforcing. All the extension activities in agriculture will be channeled through one department. Effort will be made to make the villages the central point of all agricultural development programmes. 3. In order to increase agricultural production, it is necessary to make available adequately the numerous services and facilities such as improved seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, tools and implements to the programmes of the various agencies such as the Agriculture Development Bank, the Agriculture Supply Corporation, the Land Reform Savings  Corporation, and the Cooperative Department will be operated in an integrated way. 4. Since it has become essential to consider measures to solve the problems of marketing,  \\xa0 the agricultural development programme will attempt to develop marketing channels through the reorganized cooperatives. Also, a marketing organization will be established at the national level. In addition, emphasis will be given to the adoption of an appropriate rent and land tax base in the agricultural sector. 5. Extensive feasibility studies are required if the goals of promoting agro-based industries and diversifying agriculture are to be achieved. Arrangement will be made to provide the credit and technical assistance required to the landlords for the establishment of these industries. Similarly, appropriate programmes will be implemented to increase production of food grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, and other livestock. 6. There are indications that the Terai will face decreasing prices for its grain exports to India. Efforts are urgently required to increase future exports of the Terai surplus to countries other than India. The market should also be extended towards the hills. This is possible only if the purchasing power of the hill people is increased. For these reasons, the policy is to invest in the hills according to the potentially of agricultural development. Priorities: The formulation of the Agricultural Programme under the Fourth Plan consists of specific projects and is designed at the onset to include ongoing projects which have already been started and other projects for which foreign aid has already been ear-marked by agreement. In addition, attention will be given to projects which have already been built but are not operating. Additional investment will have to be included in the programme if such projects are to be made operational. One of the overriding principles in drawing up the programme is the determination of what can be done to maximize the use of present projects, ensuring at same time a logical linking of both the continuing and new projects. Agriculture Development Programme in the Fourth Plan It is necessary to increase the output of cereal and cash crops, as much as possible, to  attain the objectives of agricultural development under the Fourth Plan. In addition, the production of fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs has to be increased in order to augment the supply of nutritious food. Keeping this in view, targets of different agricultural products, along with the necessary supply of inputs and departmental programmes, have been fixed for the Plan period and are described below: 1. Cereal Grain: During the Fourth Plan period, the population of Nepal is projected to increase at the rate  of 1.95 per cent per annum. Accordingly, the average annual increase in production will be 3 per cent. It is estimated that the annual increase in the production of paddy, maize and wheat will be 2 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 14.4 per cent respectively. This target is based upon past progress and future programmes to be implemented during the Fourth Plan period. Production targets of different cereal crops during the Fourth Plan period are shown in the Table below: In order to fulfill the target of cereal grain production, efforts will be concentrated on the provision of seeds, fertilizers, irrigation facilities, and agricultural extension to those districts selected on the basis of priority. The selection of districts for the intensive Agriculture Development Programme is based on the following factors: (a) The availability of irrigation and transport facilities; (b) Provision of organizational units concerned with agriculture development; (c) Potentially of agricultural development; (d) Regional development; and (e) Facilities of government offices. Districts selected for Intensive Agricultural Development Programme are as follows: a. Improved Seeds: Since improved seeds play an important role increasing agricultural production, it is estimated that their use will contribute to 22 per cent of the increase in the total production. It is estimated that in the last year of the Plan 25,020 metric tons of seeds will be provided for 472,000 hectares of land. A breakdown of this programme is given in Table 23. The necessary arrangements for increasing the supply of improved seeds should be made from the beginning of the Fourth Plan period. The major responsibility for this will lie with the Agriculture Education and Research Department, the Agri-Extension Department, and the Agriculture Supply Corporation. Foundation seeds which are discovered to be suitable for food grain production from research work undertaken by the agriculture stations of the Agriculture Education and Research Department and located in different parts of the country will be multiplied at government farms and made available to registered seed growers. The seed growers will grow the improved seeds under the direction and technical assistance of the Agriculture Education and Research Department. The Agriculture Supply Corporation will purchase and sell these certified seeds inside the country and import the necessary amount of seeds to meet the requirements fixed under the agriculture extension programme. Only a portion of the total amount of improved seeds required to meet the target will be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation. A major portion of the required improved seeds is expected to be provided by the farmers themselves. To accomplish this, it is necessary to make the agriculture extension programme more effective. The quantity of seeds to be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation is given in the Table 24. b. Chemical Fertilizer: More than 33 per cent of increased production during the Fourth Plan period is expected to be achie ved by the use of chemical fertilizer will be used for different crops in the last year of the Third Plan period. Those areas where irrigation available and where improved seeds are being used will be given top priority for use of fertilizer. Moreover, information about the use of the new types of chemical fertilizer will be provided to the farmers by the Department of Agriculture Extension. According to this programme, it is proposed that the Agriculture Supply Corporation will import all the required chemical fertilizer and distribute it to the farmers through its agencies. The annual quantities of chemical fertilizer used for different crops during the Plan period are given in the following Table: c. Irrigation: In accordance with the target of food grain production in the Fourth Plan, it is estimated that additional 246,000 hectares of land will require irrigation facilities. It will contribute more than 17 per cent to the increased production. During the Plan period 183,632 hectares of cultivated land will be irrigated by major, tube-well, and minor irrigation projects. Details about the various irrigation projects included in the Fourth Plan are given under the chapter on the Irrigation Programme d. Plant Protection Services: Approximately 16 per cent of the total annual agricultural production is estimated to be destroyed by diseases, insects and pests. It is thus evident that if the plant protection programme is implemented more effectively, agricultural production can be easily raised. So far, it has been possible to provide the necessary facilities to limited areas only because of lack of the necessary technicians and materials. Such services are expected to contribute about 14 per cent to increased production in the Fourth Plan period. Necessary arrangements will be made to extend plant protection services. This programme will include the training of farmers regarding plant protection, the distribution of necessary materials including polythene bags and pesticides at low prices, and the provision of emergency plant protection services. Since it is not possible to supply pesticides solely through the government, the private sector will also be encouraged in this field and will be provided with the necessary technical and other assistance. It is estimated that plant protection materials worth 5.4 million rupees will be used during the Fourth Plan period. Out of this, materials worth 3.9 million rupees will be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation. Due attention has been given to the use of improved agricultural and implements under the agriculture development programme of the Fourth Plan. The major portion of the demand for such materials is expected to be supplied by the existing Agriculture Tools and Implements Factory at Birgunj. The main responsibility for the distribution of tools and implements will be upon the Agriculture Supply Corporation. The Corporation will sell agriculture tools and implements worth Rs 7.3 million during the Plan period. To achieve the agricultural production target of the Fourth Plan, 25,000 hectares of additional land will be reclaimed, out of which 21,000 hectares will be brought under cultivation. This will contribute approximate 14 per cent to additional production. Reclamation works in these 25,000 hectares of new land will be undertaken by the Department of Resettlement and Resettlement Company. g. Cereal Crop Research: Adaptive research on the use of different inputs (i.e. improved seeds, fertilizers, tools and implements and irrigation etc.) plays an important role in achieving the targeted increase in the production of cereal crops. Research work is also essential to sustain the increase in production by solving any problem arising from the use of improved methods and inputs. In view of this, details about research on cereal crops to be undertaken during the Plan period are included in the Chapter on Agriculture Education and Research Programme. h. Cash Crop: In view of the requirements of the existing agro-industries (viz. sugar, cigarettes and jute) and level of exports during the Third Plan, it is expected that the production of cash crops will increase by 40.3 per cent during the Fourth Plan. Accordingly, the production targets of sugarcane, jute, tobacco and oilseeds have given in the following Table. Surveys of areas suitable for the cultivation of cotton will be completed, along with the experimental research work to be undertaken in the Government Agriculture Stations. As in the case of the food grain programme, arrangements for the provision of loans for the cash crop development programme will be taken care of by the concerned organization. It will be difficult to enlist the interest and cooperation of the farmers in this programme because of its newness. The targets, have been made practical. The details of the cash crop programme are given in the following Table: Research on Cash Crops Practical research work on cash crops is in the preliminary stage. It has, therefore, become necessary to pay greater attention to it. In the Fourth Plan Period, practical research work will be undertaken at the Agriculture Stations of Parwanipur, Tarhara, Bhairahawa, Janakpur and Rapti in order to introduce improved seeds and to identify improved methods of production. Under this programme, it is also proposed to produce those improved seeds which have been found suitable by research work and to distribute them to the farmers. The details of this are included in the programmes of Agriculture Education and Research. Livestock Development There is ample scope for livestock development in a mountainous country like Nepal. In addition, livestock products like meat, eggs and milk are considered to be important for nutritive diets. So far, the per capita consumption of these commodities is very low. We also must import these items. So it is, therefore, essential to pay attention to the development of livestock. In the Fourth Plan, emphasis is given to the implementation of livestock development programme in those districts where Livestock farms and other services are available. It is envisaged in the Plan to increase the production of meat, milk and eggs by 16 per cent, 23 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. The following Table shows the production targets: - Since all the slaughter animals required to fulfill the target will not be available internally from the natural increase in the country-animal stock (even including the increase due to the livestock development and improved cattle breeding programme) the shortage will be met by imports. Pasture Development Programme No programme for the supply of balanced feed and the arrangement of pasture for livestock have yet not been implemented in Nepal. For the expansion of improved animal husbandry, it is necessary to make additional arrangements for pasture. In the northern region of the country, traditional animal husbandry is deteriorating because of the lack of pastures. It has, therefore, become necessary to develop pastures in this region. In view of these factors, pasture development centers will be established in Lalitpur, Rasuwa, Ramechhap, Rapti, Sunsari and Jumla in order to undertake research and experimentation with improved grasses and to produce and distribute the seeds. The seeds of improved grasses will be imported and experimented at these centers. The seeds found to be suitable will be produced and made available to the farmers. Balanced Feed A programme for making available qualitatively improved and balanced feed is also included in the Fourth Plan. At present the only food producing center is in Hetauda. It is envisaged in the Fourth Plan to establish four additional centers in the private sector. Production of each of these center is projected in the following Table: Artificial Insemination In the field of livestock development, it has been difficult to make available improved bullocks and buffaloes in the adequate numbers for the purpose of breeding. It has become necessary, therefore, to implement an artificial insemination programme. This programme will help to increase the production of milk and other livestock products from the local breed. At present, facilities for artificial insemination have been made available at the existing seven centers and four sub-centres located in different parts of the country. In order to achieve the livestock development target of the Fourth Plan, these facilities will be provided in an extensive way. Under this programme, provision is made for the recruitment of the necessary technicians who will be posted in the existing thirty-four veterinary hospitals and seven new hospitals to be opened during the Plan period. It is expected that 198,000 cows and buffaloes will be artificially inseminated. The availability of veterinary services is essential for the protection of livestock. At present, there are 34 veterinary hospitals in the country. Seven new hospitals will be established specially in those districts where the livestock development programme is to be implemented. Existing Veterinary Hospitals are at present located in the following places: Kathmandu \\tBirgunj \\tIlam Surveys of animal diseases will also be conducted. The production of vaccines in the laboratory at Kathmandu will be expanded in hopes of gaining control of different types of diseases. Research and Training on Livestock Development Four multipurpose livestock development farms have been set up at lalitpur, chitwan, Sunsari and Kaski districts in order to conduct adaptive research on livestock farming to make available to the farms those improved animal breeds found suitable after research, and to provide practical training on animal husbandry. In addition, sheep breeding farms have been established at Chitlang, Panchasaya knola and Jumla. The goal of improving local breeds has been partially met by the improved livestock produced on these farms. In order to implement this programme more extensively, livestock development farms will be established at Nepalgunj and Taplejung during the Plan period. In addition, arrangement will be made on the Farms to provide training to the farmers regarding livestock development. The projected production of livestock on these Government farms during the Plan period is shown in the following Table. Poultry Farming Keeping in view the important role of poultry farming in the field of livestock development, a programme for the production and sale of improved breeds of chicken has been implemented. In the last few years encouraging progress has been made by the private sector in poultry farming especially in Kathmandu. At present, 100,000 chickens of the new improved breed are produced every year in the three existing hatcheries located at Parwanipur, Jawalakhel and Biratnagar. In order to fulfil the targets for poultry meat and eggs, three brooder units will be established at Pokhara, Nepalgunj and Bhairahwa during the Plan period. As the target can not be fulfilled by the Government sector alone, further contributions in this field are needed from the private sector. Hence, five hatcheries, each with an annual production capacity of 100,000 chickens should be established in the private sector. The number of chickens to be produced and distributed from both the government and private hatcheries during the Plan period is shown in the following Table: Dairy Industry It is evident that programmes such as artificial insemination, pasture development and production of improved food, as mentioned above, will help to fulful the Fourth Plan’s target of milk production. Moreover, it is expected that milk production will increase as a result of the assured market provided bythe Dairy Development Corporation which was established to prodec commercially pasteurized milk and milk– products. The production targets of processed milk, cheese and other milk products will be fulfilled mainly from this Corporation and its centers that will be established during the Plan period. The programme of the Dairy Development Corporation are as follows: (i) Urban Milk Supply Project At present, a central dairy with a capacity of 1.2 million litres has been established inKathmandu. It collects, processes, preserves and distributes milk and milk-products in a modern way. Keeping in view the increasing demand for milk, the capacity of this dairy will be increased to 3 million litres during the Plan period. In addition, since it has become necessary to provide pasteurized milk in other urban areas of the country, a programme for establishing dairies at Biratnagar, Nepalgunj and Birgunj is also included in the Fourth Plan. The projected annual production of pasteurized milk during the Plan period is shown in the following Table: (ii) Production and Sale of Cheese there is ample scope for producing milk-products in the northern region of Nepal where animal husbandry is the main occupation of the people. So far, cheese factories have been established in Lamtang, Thodung and Pike. It is estimated that the production of cheese from these factories was approximately 20 metric ton in 1969/70. during the Fourth Plan period, five new factories will be established in different parts of the country. It is estimated that 50 metric tons of cheese will be produced from these factories by the end of the Plan period. (iii) Butter producing Centre It is estimated that 19 metric tons of butter were produced in 1969/70 by the Dairy Development Corporation. During the Plan period, two butter producing centers will be established in the area of greatest potentiality in the country. Carcass Utilization Project According to the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the United Nations, this project is being implemented at Hetauda. It will also include training in order to improve the quality of raw materials needed for the leather industry. Raw materials needed for such industries will be flayed and cured, thereby helping to increase the income of people involved in this kind of work. Products to be made available from this project will include some nutritious materials necessary for animal feed (like meat-cum-bone meal, meat-meal, bone-meal, technical fate) and horn and hoof meal fertilizer, bone-meal fertilizer, compost manure, hoof needle oil, leather etc. since the dead bodies will be collected as soon as possible the possibilities of spreading diseases to men and livestock will be reduced. Fisheries Development Since there is a suitable climate and an adequate quantity of water in the different lakes and rivers of Nepal, it has become essential to pay attention to the development of fisheries in hopes of making available an essential nutritive diet for the increasing population. At present, no estimate of total fish production of the country is available. It is, however, estimated that additional fish production was approximately 560 metric tons in the fiscal year 1969/70. Plan it is envisaged to increase additional fish production from 560 metric tons to 2000 metric tons by 1974-75. According to this estimate, the quantity of fish to be available from different sources is shown in the following Table: About one million fingerlings were sold in the year 1969/70. In order to fulfil the estimated target of fish production, 4 million fingerlings will have to be sold in the year 1974/75. since it is not possible to produce the fingerlings from the Government Fishery Centres and Fish-farms alone, the private sector will be encouraged to produce more and will be provided with technical and other assistance. It is estimated that while carrying the fingerlings from the government Fish Centres to the farmers’ ponds, the rate of mortality is about 25 per cent. To c ompensate for this, about one million fingerlings should be produced in the private sector. During the Plan period, the annual projected production of fingerlings from all the fishery development projects operated by the government sector is given in the following Table: Accordingly, it has been estimated that more than 1,500 metric tons of fish will be produced by the end of the Plan due to the distribution of the fingerlings. This still leaves about 500 metric tons to fulfil the plan target. This shortage will be met by the production of the Government Fish Centres and Farms and the fisheries contract on different rivers. The annual projected production of the Government Fish Centres and Farms during the Plan period is given in the following Table: Fish breeding centers and commercial farms have been established in different pars of the country in order to breed native and foreign fishes (like carps, trouts, asala and mahasher) after the necessary survey and research is done in accordance with the climatic and geographinc conditions of the country. During the Fourth Plan period, two new breeding centers and two large fish development centers will be established. Horticulture Development It is essential to increase the production of fruits and vegetables in order to meet the growing internal demand for nutritious food and to possibly increase the volume of exports. Since diverse climatic conditions are present in the country, there is ample opportunity to produce different potential for development in this field, the targets for the production of fruits, vegetables and potatoes during the Fourth Plan period have been fixed and are given in the following Table: The requirements for those seeds and plant inputs necessary to fulfil the Plans production target for each crop have been estimated, and the programme for making such inputs available has been determined as follows: Fruits In order to fulful the targets of the Plan, 2.25 million plants will be required for an additional 9,000 hectares or 250 plants per hectare. This requirement will be met by the production of the horticulture centers located in different parts of the country and also by the provision of incentives and encouragement to the private sector. The shortage will be met by imports. The annual programme making these plants available is shown in the following Table: Potatoes It is estimated that it will be necessary to cultivate potatoes on an additional 11,125 hectares of land in order to increase the production of potatoes by 100,000 metric tons by the end of the Plan period. This will require 12,500 metric tons of potato seeds, including 1 M.T. per hectare for the 11,125 hectares and a provision for potential loss. The Nucleus Seed Production Programme will be implemented to meet this requirement. Under this programme, registered growers will produce improved potato seeds under the technical guidance of the Horticulture Department. Foundation seeds will be produced and made available from the Potato Development Centres under the Horticulture Department. Fertilizers and other inputs required for this programme will be made available fro the Agricultural Supply Corporation. It is expected that 12,500 metric tons of potato seeds will be produced by the third year of the Plan period. Vegetable Seeds In order to produce the additional 20 metric tons of vegetable seeds envisaged in the Plan, it will e necessary to cultivate vegetables on 40 hectares of land, assuming that 500 Kg. A Nucleus Seed Production Programme will be implemented for this purpose as in the case of potato seeds production, and necessary technical and other assistance will be provided to the private sector. Accordingly, the annual programme for cultivating vegetables both in the Hilly and Terai Regions is given in the following Table: Large Scale Horticulture Development In order to augment horticulture production effectively and to develop it commercially a large scale horticulture development programme will be implemented in those places where transportation facilities are available. Accordingly, two 40 hectare horticultural farms will be established along Prithivi Highway and Arniko Highway. Similarly another horticulture farm covering an area of 120 hectares will be established along the Simra-Janakpur sector of Mahendra Highway. Horticulture Research At present, experimental research work aimed at increasing the production of fruits, potatoes and vegetables is being undertaken at horticultural stations located in different parts of the country. Before the Third Plan, there were 16 such stations, including nurseries under the Department of Horticulture. New stations will be established at Humla and Mustang district during the Fourth Plan period. Emphasis in this research programme will be given to the fulfillment of the production targets of the Fourth Plan. Since no programme has yet been implemented in the field of horticulture, research work will also be encouraged in this field at the existing stations. Agricultural Education and Research In order to ascertain the effects of the combined or individual use of various inputs (like improved seeds, fertilizers, implements, pesticides and irrigation) in increasing the output of important cereal and cash crops and also to determine their practical utility, research work has already been started in the agricultural stations and farms of the Department of Agricultural Education and Research located in different parts of the country. The training programme for technicians required in the agricultural sector is also continuing. During the Fourth Plan period, all research activities undertaken by the Agricultural Education and Research Department will be made more effective, emphasizing those aspects of research which directly help to increase productivity. Because of the great climatic differences in the country, it is not possible to apply the results of research and experiments from one area to another. Therefore, all research activities in all stations and farms will be carried out in an integrated way. The programmes to be implemented by various actions are as follows: (a) Agricultural Botany In hopes of improving cereal crops such as paddy, wheat, corn, millet as well as other crops such as oil-seeds and pulses, the collection of improved seeds from both internal and external sources and the multiplication of those seeds found suitable after analysis and varietal test will be expanded. At present, sample -analysis of seeds as required by the Agriculture supply corporation  and the district agricultural development programme are being undertaken at a Seed Testing Laboratory in Kathmandu. Since the Centre is unable to provide the required facilities for testing seeds, additional laboratories will be established in the agricultural stations located at Parwanipur, Janakpur and Bhairahwa during the Plan period. In addition, a seed multiplication and development project will be implemented with the joint collaboration of His Majesty’s Government, Nepal and the United Nations Special Fund. Under this programme, a seed-processing center will be established at Hetauda and necessary technical services for the production of certified seeds will be provided to the farmers (b) Agronomy In accordance with the Plan target, foundation seeds (including the imported varieties that are found suitable after botanical research and analysis) will be produced at various agricultural farms in the country. In addition, experimental research work on the use of the new variety seeds, fertilizers, water and other inputs will be continued as in the past. These foundation-seeds will be produced at the agricultural farms at Khumaltar, Doti, Nepalgunj and Janakpur and the agricultural stations at Rampur, Parwanipur, Tarahara and Bhairahwa. In order to develop improved seeds suitable for the hilly regions, two agronomy farms, one in the eastern hills and the other in the western hills, will be established during the Plan period: The design and estimation of agricultural construction projects and research on improved agricultural tools and machines, including experimental works regarding irrigation channels, tubewells, drainage and water utilization, will be continued as in the past. The necessary technical services will also be made available to the farmers. (d) \\tEntomology The research programme in the field of entomology includes an extensive survey of insects and parasites, a collection and study of their life cycles, character and nature, the influence of weather, and the use of various pesticides and chemical control measures. On the basis of results obtained from research work, crop-protection measures will be made more effective. Necessary technical help will be established at Rampur, Nepalgunj, Rajbiraj, Bhairahwa and Dahngarhi during the Plan period. Specific research will be carried on regarding those insects which appear to be important from an industrial point of view: bees, silk-worms, etc. in addition, legal measures will be taken, and plant quarantine units will be established in order to check the entry of new pests and other disease-transmitting insects and to prevent the spread of pest within the country, thereby making the farmers more enthusiastic and responsive towards crop protection measures. Plant Quarantine Check-Posts will be established at Tribhuwan Airport, Birgunj, Nepalgunj, Jogbani and Bhairahwa during the Plan period. In order to control plant disease and to safeguard productions, plant pathological research will be conducted on both local and improved varieties of paddy, corn, wheat, citrus fruits, vegetables, potatoes, oranges, sugarcane, jute and tobacco. Research, experimentations, and demonstration of the simple, economic, and effective measures to control plant diseases will be undertaken. For this purpose, there is at present a laboratory at Khumaltar, and plant protection units have also been set-up at Ilam, Biratnager, Rapti and Dhaulagiri Zones during the Plan period. Because this programme is also related to entomology, both will be jointly implemented by all the plant protection units. (f) Soil Science In order to ascertain the production potential of the soil, the initial necessary steps are the survey, analysis and classification of the different types of soil found in the country. A central laboratory has been established for the analysis of various types of soil and their properties. In the Plan period a soil survey of 3.427 million hectares, of land and a analysis of 40,000 samples of soil will be conducted. Experimentation on the productivity differences of major crops like jute, maize and paddy, as a result of the application of different organic and chemical fertilizers with various types of soil and climatic conditions, will be conducted at different Agricultural Stations and Farms. Studies will also be undertaken regarding soil physics, soil microbiology, and soil conservation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made at eh beginning of the Plan period to ensure better coordination between the different programmes. The work to be done by the respective sections has already been outlined above. (h) Agricultural College In order to fulfil the requirements for medium and other lower level technicians, an agricultural school was established in 1956. An Agricultural College was established in 1968, with the objective of domestically providing the training facilities for higher level technicians. By the end of 1970, it is projected that 225 persons will be trained up to I.Sc. level, 25 persons up to B.Sc. level, 700 persons up to JTA levels, 340 J.T. As will be upgraded and field training will be provided to 500 persons. Agriculture Extension The Agriculture Extension Programme has been used as an important means of providing technical assistance and necessary knowledge to the farmers so that they could adopt improved modern agricultural techniques such as the applicable findings of different agricultural research activities. Under this programme, District Agricultural Development Offices manned with Agricultural Graduates have already been established in 43 distric ts, and in each of another 22 districts, there are two to four medium level Agricultural technicians. At present, under the Agricultural Extension Department, there are 43 District Agricultural So far, Agricultural Extension has been primarily limited to food crops. It has, however, become necessary to pay attention to horticulture, fishery and livestock development projects in order to fulfil the Plan targets in these sectors. To implement the Agricultural Extension Programme effectively during the Plan period, specialists in cereals, cash crops, livestock, and horticulture, will be made available to the District Agriculture Development Offices according to their agricultural development programmes. Moreover,\\tthe number of village-level extension workers will be increased technical assistance will be provided to them from the nearest Agriculture Centres and Agriculture Farms. According to this policy, the District Agriculture Development Offices in 28 selected districts will be further strengthened in order to implement the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme. In each of the above districts there will be a J.T.A for every three Panchayats, and one J.T. for 9 J.T.As, and one Graduate level agricultural technician for each District Agriculture Development Office. In these 28 districts, each J.T.A. and J.T. will have the responsibility of conducting agricultural extension work in their respective panchayats, the names of which will be specifically stated. If, after the requirements of the 28 districts are filled, there are any remaining J.T.As, J.T.s and Agricultural Graduates, they will be posted in the other 37 districts where Agricultural Development Offices have been established, including those 22 districts where only J.T.s have been deputed. They will be distributed according to the Districts’ agricultural development programme. Since there is no arrangement in the central office to investigate and identify the problems and to evaluate the facts and figures of the reports received from the District Agriculture Development Offices, it is important to initiate this kind of work. The Agriculture Extension Programmes’ training and demonstrations to be conducted 1. Method-Demonstration They will be given instructions by the J.T.s. and J.T.As, who are working in the panchayats under the guidance of DADO’s on the use of scientific method in agriculture (such as plant protection measures, different chemicals and mechanical uses), the improved techniques of cultivation, the application of chemical fertilizers, green-manures, farm-yard manures and also the preparation and used of compost manures. Instruction will be also given to the farmers regarding the methods of improved animal husbandry, poultry farming and fishing, the required balanced diet for them, and methods of protection against various diseases and other pests. Each J.T.A. living in a panchayat will carry out method-demonstration; and in the 28 districts covered by the intensive agricultural development programme, at least one compulsory method-demonstration regarding paddy, wheat and maize crops, in each Panchayat, will be carried out every year. In other districts, the method- demonstration on fruits, vegetables, animal husbandry, and fishing will also be carried out, according to the climate of the district. 2. Result-Demonstrating To show and convince farmers directly about the importance and advantages of the findings of research and the improved methods of agriculture, result-demonstrations will be arranged. Since the farmers are easily convinced of the value of new techniques used by others or heard about from others, they will be shown the effects of improved seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides on their own fields. For this purpose, the improved seed varieties are to be sown along with the local ones. This will prove to be very advantageous if adopted; therefore, great attention will be given to this faster and more effective programme. While carrying out the result-demonstrations, the farmers should be convinced that improved seeds will produce more than the local ones. These type of demonstrations will be carried out particularly on paddy, maize, wheat and cash crops. For demonstrations, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and variety seeds will be provided free of cost to the farmers. J.T.As will perform in heir assigned areas: two to three result-demonstrations for paddy and wheat, three for maize in the hills, one each in the Terai, and two for cash crops. 3. Leader Farmer Training J.T.As stationed in various villages are to teach new techniques and provide necessary knowledge to the farmers regarding the cultivation of better seeds, uses of fertilizers, pesticides, medicines, agricultural implements, and scientific methods for livestock rearing. The necessary seeds, fertilizers, medicines, etc., will be provided free of charge to the J.T.As for these training programmes. The target of providing training to at least ten Leader Farmers has been set. 4. Seasonal In- Service Training Provisions have been made to provide seasonal training to the J.T.As on such matters as new seeds, fertilizers, plant protection and other medicines  \\trecommended as useful by the research programme and also about new methods of horticulture, fishery and livestock rearing. Such a programme is not to be longer than five days and should be arranged in each of the zones  by those related to or in the agricultural department. Keeping the zones by those related to in possible to conduct this type of training programme in all of the districts, so efforts will be made to train a most five J.Ts. and J.T.As from the intensive districts. The training programme will cost of two parts: (a) Winter Season Training: The course will include audio-visual training and will cover all kinds of winter crops and fruits, taking place from Mid-September to Mid-Novemner. (b) Summer Season Training: Training will be provided primarily in paddy, maize, other summer crops and fruits and fishing, taking place from Mid-February to Mid-Apil. 5. Farmers’ Day A farmers’ Day will be arranged in order to teach progressive peasants about the research findings of the Government Agriculture Farms and Centres on improved seeds, fertilizers and manures, animals, birds and fruits. It has been found that such Farmer’s Day have had significant influence upon the farmers, especially since it is not possible to have all the farmers in one place and since the number of Agricultural Farms and Centres is limited. Farmer’s Day will be held by transporting farmers to agricultural farms and centers from outlying districts. Since the number of 100 progressive farmers from one district will be allowed to participate in Farmer’s Day may also be held on the farm of a progressive farmer within the district. The agricultural project’s model charts, posters, pictures, booklets, etc. are exhibited at the fair. The main objective of the exhibition is to attract the attention and interest of the farmers and to encourage them to use the improved farming methods. The evaluation committee will decide the items for exhibition, as well as later judging them. The successful farmers will be awarded prizes of agricultural implements and booklets. This is mainly to arouse enthusiasm and interest among the farmers. 7. More Grain Production Competition (a) To attract the farmers to the improved agricultural techniques; (b) To create interest in reater grain production; (c) To participate actively in agriculture extension work; (d) To raise social prestige and to create a feeling of satisfaction among the farmers by increasing their productivity. To fulfil the above purposes, competition will be held on the district and national level for paddy, wheat and maize crops each year. At present it is not practical to have completion in all districts. Competition among the Hill and Terai districts will be in those districts which have been progressive in the adoption of improved agricultural techniques. At the district-level-competition, a minimum of ten farmers should participate. Before the contest, the selected districts of Hill and the Terai will be put into various groups of two or three according to the progress made in cereal crop development. These groups will then compete (separating hill districts and the Terai districts) against one another. The Department will determine which districts stand first, second and third in a particular crop according to the records sent from the districts. Nine members from both the Hills and the Terai will compete at the national level on paddy, wheat and maize. The winning farmer will be recognized as the “largest cereal producer” at the national level and will be given letters of recognitions and certificates, as well as cash prizes. 8. Rural Youth Programme The objective of the Rural Youth Programme is to convert rural youth between 10 and 21 years of age into literate and progressive farmers and to provide them with practical training in modern and improved methods of agriculture. For this purpose, 4-H Clubs will be organized for rural youth, and training will be provided to them on improved cultivation, animal husbandry, home science and small scale industry, under the guidance of the J.T., J.T.A. and other adult leaders who have been trained result-demonstrations on paddy, wheat, maize and vegetable crops will be done at each club. They are also to engage in community service 4 -H activities, festivals, cultivation programmes; tours kitchen gardening, and other programmes. 9. Agriculture Information Programme This will be done through the mediums of ratio broadcasting, documentary films, exhibitions, audio-visual aids, publication of books and booklets, and agricultural news written in a simple language. Food Research The food research programme is being implemented with the objectives of conducting research on the nutritious value of available food stuffs and the provision of technical assistance to make the necessary arrangements for maintaining regular standards and quality of food stuffs for export and domestic consumption. A Food Research Laboratory has already been established for this purpose. Research works in the laboratory will be conducted in an effective way during the Fourth Plan period. In addition, research work will be undertaken regarding the production of nutritive food from industrial waste and the preservation of food. A study survey on the nutritious elements of food will also be undertaken. Resettlement Programme There has been increasing population pressure on land, especially in the hilly regions of the country, as a result of natural increase and the lack of cultivable land, there has been a growing uncontrolled movement into the Terai forests because of malaria eradication. The problem of resettlement has become more complicated due to an increasing influx of Nepalese from outside, including the ex- servicemen. In a view of this, a Resettlement Company was set up in the year 1964 in order to settle landless farmers and their families in a n organized and planned manner. A Resettlement Department has also been recently established, thereby making implementation of these programmes more extensive. It will be the responsibility of the Nepal Resettlement Company to carry-out comparatively big projects, involving the resettlement of thousands of farmers. Resettlement Committees. It has already been mentioned that additional cultivated land will be a significant contribution to the achievement of the target of food grains production for the Fourth Plan. It has  been envisage in the Plan to settle 8,000 families after reclaiming25,000 hectares of land. The details of the resettlement programme to be implemented by the Nepal Resettlement Company and the Resettlement Department are given in the following two Tables: Agri-Economic Research and Studies It has been difficult to formulate and properly implement policies and plans for agricultural development because of a lack of basic studies and research work. At present, data on agricultural production and area under cultivation are available. There is, however, a lack of data regarding capital formation in agriculture, wage rates of seasonal labour, the marketing of agricultural products, income elasticity of demand for food, input-output relationships in agriculture, the feasibility of agro-based industries, and evaluations on the impact of land reform, agricultural extension, agricultural education and research programmes. Therefore, a programme for the collection of these data has been included in the Fourth Plan Outlay on Agricultural Development Programme Details of the programmes to be implemented during the Plan period are given in the Appendix. The allocation of financial resources for these programmes under the concerned departments is as follows: It is evident that the achievement of the agricultural development programme targets depend primarily upon the efficiency of hundreds of thousands of farmers. In order to enable the farmers to increase production and to adequately use modern agricultural inputs, it is urgently necessary to provide credit on easy terms. This has, in turn, created obstacles in the provision of credit to farmers. Based upon actual experience gained so far the following arrangements will be made for the supply of credit, inputs, and marketing facilities in those districts where intensive agricultural development programme will be implemented during the Fourth Plan period: 1. Instead of establishing new organizations to supply institutional agricultural credit for inputs at the village level, the existing institutions will be strengthened, i.e., Cooperatives, the Agricultural Development Bank, the Land Reform Savings Corporation, and the Agriculture Supply Corporation and Ward Committees. 2. Village Committees will be entrusted with the collection of Compulsory Savings at the village level, the provision of individual agricultural credit, the sale of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers and other inputs in all 28 districts where the Intensive Agriculture Development Programme w ill be implemented. All records of the financial transactions and marketing operations of Village Committees will be kept by the secretaries of the concerned Village Panchayats. The Land Reform Savings Corporation will depute 344 credit inspectors and establish 14 regional offices in order to supervise and guide the Village Committees. When these Villages Committees are efficient enough to run on their own the Committees will be converted into Village Multipurpose Cooperative Societies, and the compulsory savings, subject to the approval of deposits, will be transformed into the share capital of the society. Thus when the committees are converted into Multipurpose Cooperative Societies, the Cooperatives will be reorganized at the inter-village level in the following way. In the interim period, Village Committees with function only as agents of the Inter-Village Cooperative Organization and will sell agricultural inputs to the farmers of the village on the basis of a prescribed commission. The Land Reform Savings Corporation will provide general agricultural production loans through village committees on commission as at present. His Majesty’s Government will provide grants to the Land Reform Savings Corporation for the administrative expenses of Credit Inspectors who will be supervising Village Committees. 3. The Department of Cooperatives will establish up to 10 inter-village cooperative organizations after reorganizing in stages the existing cooperatives in the 28 intensive districts. The Cooperative Institutions, thus resources-organized, will receive guidance and administrative support from the Agricultural Development Bank. During the plan period, the Department will set up offices in those districts with cooperative institutions and will provide facilities for supervision and audit. Trained persons will be posted by the Agricultural Development Bank in such institutions to work as managers of the cooperative organizations, His Majesty’s Government will provide grants to the Agricultural Development Bank\\tto cover the administrative expenses of such persons. The cooperative institutions organized at the inter- village level will proved credit to their members, and acting as agent of the Agricultural Supply Corporation, they will supply agricultural inputs through the Village Committees and undertake the marketing of agriculture products of the concerned village panchayats. 4. At the district level, the Agriculture Development Bank will establish branches for the overall supervision of financial transactions and the provision of individual loans to farmers for larger undertakings. Similarly, the Agriculture Supply Corporation will establish its offices at the district level in order to provide agricultural inputs and marketing facilities. At the village level, the resources-organized cooperative organizations, acting as agents of the corporation, will undertake the marketing of these inputs. 5. In the districts where the Intensive Agriculture Development Programme will not be implemented, the programme in this field will continue as in the past. The cooperative system was introduced in the country during the first Plan period. The increased number of societies indicates that there has been remarkable progress in this field. During the 12 year period the number of cooperatives has increased to about 1,300. these cooperatives were not developed merely by those people who accept the principles and ideal of the cooperative movement. Therefore, the existing cooperatives lack sufficient funds, members, knowledge, and efficiency of management. Hence, it was natural that these fast growing cooperatives would not have the anticipated qualitative development. Out of the 1,300 existing cooperative societies, about two third of the 1,100 concerned with agriculture are ineffective and are in the process of liquidation. Of the rest, some need promotional measures, whereas, others need to be amalgamated. Therefore, it is envisaged in the Fourth Plan to resources-organize the existing societies, and to concentrate on quality rather then quantity Programme in the Fourth Plan In view of the lack of technical personnel, resources, and managerial skill at the Village level, it  is impracticable to establish cooperative societies simultaneously throughout the country. Since each society thus established will cover more then one village, they will be called inter-village cooperative societies. As stated above, the management of these societies will be supervised for the required period of time. These societies will concentrate their activities primarily on the provision of credit to the member farmers, the supply of agricultural inputs through village committees, and the marketing of agricultural products in an organized way so that the farmers can get proper remuneration for their labour. When the village committees are converted into village multipurpose cooperative societies, they will then become members of the inter-village cooperative organization. When cooperatives at the village level are functioning smoothly and effectively, inter-village cooperatives will be amalgamated, and then only one organization will be constituted at the district level. In the first year of the Fourth Plan, at least two inter-village cooperative organizations will be established by the amalgamation or resources-organization of the existing societies in the 28 intensive districts. Cooperative societies thus resources-organized will be established in each district as required by the end of the Plan period. Although cooperatives have been introduced in 56 districts of the country, the Fourth Plan gives priority to the 28 districts, where the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme will be implemented. They will be strengthened by providing trained personnel, such as cooperative inspectors, accountants, and others. In the Central Office, the audit section will be made more effective and efficient. In addition, a separate section to deal with agricultural production is not marketed in accordance with cooperative principles and the farmers are not guaranteed fair prices, agricultural production is likely to be adversely affected. Theoretical and practical training of 3 to 6 months duration and a short-term in-service training programme will be continued by the Cooperative Training Centre for departmental personnel and managers of cooperative societies. Moreover, mobile training teams for the districts will provide short- term practical training to the members and staff of the cooperative organizations. B. Among the inputs required to achieve the targets of the Fourth Plan, chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, pesticides, and improved implements will be supplied mainly by the Agriculture Supply Corporation. The amount of different inputs to be sold during the Plan period by the Corporation is given in the following Table: At present, the Agriculture Supply Corporation has its central office at Kathmandu with six branches in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Janakpur, Biratnagar, Bhairahwa and Nepalgunj; nine depots in Chituwan, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Saptari, Sirha, Jhapa, Taulihawa, phokara and Bardia and four seasonal supply centers in Parasi, Dang, Kailali and Palpa. Will be established in all 28 districts where the Intensive Agricultural Development programme will be implemented. These depots will provide the necessary agricultural inputs and supply the chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, polythene bags, to the iner-village cooperative organizations and village committees. Warehouses Warehouses are under construction in Kathmandu and Birgunj to cope with the increasing volume of trade. During the Third Plan period, with the completion of warehouses for fertilizers and seeds, the corporation will have warehouses with a capacity of 2,500 M.T. 2,000 M.T. and 1,000 M.T. respectively at Birgunj, Kathmandu and Bhairahawa. During the Fourth Plan Period warhouses will be constructed as need in the 28 districts where the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme will be implemented. The expenditure required to implement the above mentioned programmes is given in the following Table: required to implement the above mentioned programmes, the entire expenditure for warehouses and 50 percent of administrative expenditures will be borne by His Majesty’s Government. It is evident that the foreign exchange facilities required for this purpose will be made available by His Majesty’s Government. Warehouses and Marketing Because there is no institutional organization for marketing and storing agricultural products, the actual farmer does not receive proper remuneration for his labour. With no facilities for storage, they are compelled to sell their products even when the prices are low. If essential marketing facilities are not provided, farmers cannot be induced to produce more. This is demonstrated by the increase production of wheat. Otherwise, it is possible that the target for increased production will be difficult to attain as a result of the lack of markets and decreased prices. A will organized Marketing and Warehousing Corporation will, therefore, be established for this purpose during the Fourth Plan period. In the preliminary stage, this corporation will expand the external market of agricultural products and provide facilities to the farmers for storage over given period of time. On the basis of agricultural products stored, farmers could get required credit from the Agricultural Development Bank, the Land Reform Savings Corporation or any other financial institution, and they could sell their products when market conditions become favourable. Since most of the improved seeds required during the Plan period will be produced by the farmers themselves, storage facilities can be provided to such farmers by the proposed Corporation. Rupees 7.8 million in the form of share capital of His Majesty’s Government has been allocated for this corporation in the Fourth Plan. If additional resources are required, requirements for share capital will be made available from Nepal Rastra Bank, Agriculture Development Bank, Land Reform Savings Corporation and other financial institutions. From the very beginning, the Corporation will construct warehouses from available resources at appropriate places in the country for its own use and the use of farmers. Agricultural Credit In order to achieve the targets of the Fourth Plan, agricultural credit of 220 million rupees over  that which is mobilized in the private sector will be needed for the provision of various inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, plants and seeds and other inputs for horticulture development, chicken, fingerlings and improved livestock for poultry, fisheries and livestock development. The Agricultural Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation are the main sources of agricultural credit and can provide credit worth 475.1 million rupees during the Plan period. Therefore, long-term credit worth Rs 250 million can be made available to augment capital expenditure on implements, storage and minor irrigation projects for agricultural development in the private sector. Short term agricultural credit will be provided to the farmers in the intensive districts by the Land Reform Savings Corporation through the district offices and ward committees. Similarly, the Agricultural Development Bank will provide small loans to member farmers through cooperative Organizations and large scale credit for specific purposes directly through its district offices. The details of agricultural credit supplied during the Third Plan period by the Agricultural Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation are given in the following Table: The above Table shows that the Agricultural Development Bank has, on average, supplied annually more then Rs 5.8 million  \\tof credit for various purposes. The Land Reform Savings Corporation has supplied about 10.0 million rupees. During the Fourth Plan period, more then Rs 470 million of credit will be provided by the Agriculture Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation. Annual details are given below: In order to achieve the approved agricultural targets of the Fourth Plan, the Agricultural Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation will provide credit on the basis of the annual programme through the concerned organizations or committees, as required for cereal crops, cash crops, horticulture, livestock and poultry and fisheries development. His Majesty\\'s Government will provide grants amounting to 10 million rupees for the personnel expensed to the Agricultural Development Bank in order to operate the inter-village cooperative organizations and to the Land Reform Savings Corporation in order to supervise the Village Committees. The estimated outlay required for implementing the above mentioned programme regarding agricultural credit, inputs and marketing during the Fourth Plan period, is as follows:- The water resources of the country are adequate for the development of irrigation facilities. The three major river systems are Kosi, Narayani and Karnali. Before crossing the border they drain a total area of 141,190 sq. Kilometres or 83 per cent of the total catchments area of all the river systems of the country. These three rivers have their head waters in the main Himalayan range, and are perennial due to glacial origin. k.m. These rivers are, from west to east- Sharada, Babai, Rapti, Bagmati, Kamala, Kankai and Mechi. These rivers are also perennial since the source of these rivers is either in the Himalayan or Hahabharat ranges. In addition, there are several small streams which have their origin in the Chure hill. Among these small streams are the Banganga , Tinau, Balan and Trijuga. They have catchment areas varying from 256 sq. k.m. Progress in Irrigation Development Prior to the First Five Year Plan, only 14,700 hectares of land are recorded to have had irrigation facilities provided by the government. Irrigation facilities for an additional 17,200 hectares were provided during the First Plan Period. During the Second Plan Period, 26,500 hectares of land were brought under irrigation. Thus before the beginning of the Third Plan total irrigation facilities provided by the government covered an area of 58,400 hectares of land. The revised target of the Third Five Year Plan was to provide irrigation facilities for 148,000 hectares of land. During the four years of the Plan period, in other words by the end of 1968-69, irrigation facilities have been provided to 59,090 hectares of land by the completion of the following projects: Objectives, Policies and Priorities of Irrigation Development in the Fourth Plan Objectives The irrigation programme in the Fourth Plan is formulated to reach the following objectives: (a) To provide irrigation facilities as required for the agricultural development projects; (b) To gradually reduce dependence on uncertain monsoon and thereby increase agricultural production by creating opportunities for growing more than one crop Policy and Priority In accordance with the above objectives the following policies and priorities are adopted for the Plan period: 1. During the past few years special attention was given to the development of minor irrigation projects. Therefore, medium and major irrigation projects were not given proper attention. Since a considerable part of the irrigation facilities provided so far have been minor projects, it is evident that such projects are not suitable for meeting long-term irrigation requirements. Since construction of major irrigation projectors depends upon external aid, the timely development of irrigation potential 2. There are some projects which have been started but not completed during the Third Plan, but will be completed in the Fourth Plan. Two of these projects are the Gandak and Chatra canals which are being constructed directly by the Indian Government and will be completed and made available during the Plan period. 3. In order to utilize ground water, tube-well projects also will be implemented as required. Feasible minor irrigation projects will also be implemented during this Plan period. At the same time, renovation and extension of old projects will be continued. River control and reclamation projects will also be implemented to prevent losses during the rainy season. 5. Since there is no water management code for effective use and protection of water resources available in the country, necessary steps will be taken in the Fourth Plan period to institute an appropriate water management programme designed to ensure the efficient construction, maintenance and operation of irrigation dams, canals and distributories. Permanent arrangement will be made with necessary coordination between the Departments of Agriculture and Irrigation. 6. Although all activities concerning irrigation were being carried out by one department until very recently, two separate departments-Minor Irrigation Department and Irrigation Department have been established. Irrigation Development Programme in the Fourth Plan The irrigation programme in the Fourth Plan has been determined in accordance with the priority of irrigation policy and the targets of agricultural production. Accordingly, irrigation facilities will be provided to 183,632 hectares of land during the Plan period. Detailed programmes are given below: (a) Major Irrigation Programme Since all projects cannot be completed within the Plan period, only 146,700 hectares of land will be provided with irrigation facilities by the end of the Plan. 1. Sharada Irrigation Project Having constructed a weir near Mahendranagar in Kanchanpur district, the Indian Government is already utilizing water from the Mahakali river (which is called Sharad in India) for production of power and irrigation. Under provisions of the agreement between His Majesty\\'s Government and the Indian Government regarding this project, India has now agreed to supply 460cusecs of water for irrigation in Nepal. This project is therefore, included in the Plan. 2. Kamala Irrigation Project This project is expected to provide irrigation facilities to 28,000 hectares of Dhanusha and Sirha districts. Although the project was started in 1961, no progress was made after completion of the right canal. It is now envisaged in this Plan to start the construction work during the third year of the Fourth Plan. Under this project it is proposed to construct a wier in the Kamala river near Chisapani village and to construct canals on both banks. The cost of the project is estimated at Rs 5,50,00,000. A feasibility report of this project has been completed. 3. Lohattar Irrigation Project Lohattar is a tributary of the Rapti river in Narayani Zone. The project is expected to irrigate a total area of 12,000 hectares of land in the eastern part and a portion of the western part of Rapti The project intends to utilize a total of 516 cusecs of water with the construction of head- works in the Sano-Rapti, Budi Rapti and Dungriya rivers, as well as the Lohattar. A feasibility report of the project has been completed and its total cost is estimated to be Rs 2,97,50,000. the construction work of this project is expected to be completed in the last year of the plan. By the completion of this project and the Khageri Project (already completed), a large percentage of the cultivable land of Rapti Valley will be irrigated. 4. Bagmati Irrigation Project Bagmati is one of the main medium-sized rivers in Central Nepal. A barrage will be constructed near Mangalpur, near the place where the Bagmati river flows into the Terai plain and passes through the Mahabharat and Chure ranges. The project aims to utilize 34.7 cubic metre water per second on each bank or a total of 69.4 cubic metre per second of water. The total cost of this project is estimated to be Rs 15,00,000,000. the project feasibility report has been completed. The project will be started in the last year of the Plan and 25 per cent of the construction work will be completed in the same year. 5. Patharaiya Irrigation Project The Canal on the right side will irrigate 2,000 hectares of land. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 30,00,000. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 30,00,000. The construction work of this project has been in progress since fiscal year 1969-70 and is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan. 6. Banganga Irrigation Project Although the river has been utilized for irrigation through the Jagdishpur reservoir for many years, this project will further increase the irrigation facilities in the area. The reservoir will be renovated and its storage capacity will be increased. The canal will irrigate about 8,000 hectares of land. The construction cost is estimated to be Rs 1,40,00,000. Construction will begin in the first year of the Plan and will be completed by the end of the Plan period. 7. Rapti Irrigation Project Although the Rapti River is one of the important rivers in Banks district, it has yet to be harnessed. Agricultural production will increase considerably if the Rapti is irrigated by the implementation of this project. Since there is a possibility of completing the inundation canals without building the headworks, construction costs of the project will be reduced considerably. The project will irrigate 3,000 hectares of land and the total cost of construction is estimated to be Rs 40,00,000. The construction work of the project has been underway since 1969-70 and is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan period. 8. Chapakot Tar Irrigation Project Chapakot \\tT\\tar is in Syangja District of Gandaki Zone. The project plan shows the construction of the diversion weir at Jyagdi River in Darsing village and a canal system on the left bank by which 80 cusecs of water will be supplied for the irrigation of 2,000 hectares of land. In the absence of irrigation facilities, only maize and millet are grown in limited areas at the present time. Construction work of the project will be completed n the second year of the Plan. 9. Chaurjahri Tar Irrigation Project This project is in Rukum district. About 250 hectares of land will be irrigated after the completion of this project. Estimated cost of the project is Rs 7,00,000. Although projects in remote and inaccessible districts cost much more then in the Terai, they are vital in the development programmes of such districts. In a remote district like Rukum, provision of irrigation facilities, even though in a small amount, would increase food production and help to solve the problem of food deficit. The survey, design and cost estimate of the project have been already completed. Construction work was started in 1969/70 and will be completed in the second year of the Plan. 10. Renovation and Extension (including Chandra Canal) Under this programme, the necessary renovation and extension of various irrigation projects already completed will be undertaken. This will ensure the more effective utilization of the irrigation potential of the projects and thereby provide additional benefits. This programme mainly deals with the renovation of structures in the canal, and extension of the canal. The project report for renovation of the Chandra canal is under preparation. Renovation and extensin of Tilawe, Jhajh and Dudhora projects are also included in this programme. 11. Flood Control and Reclamation Due to topographic conditions, river flood during the rainy season, change their courses, and causes bank erosion which endangers the adjoining settlements and destroys cereal crops every year. Recognizing the urgent need for protection of land against such damages, this programme has been implemented from the year 1969/70. Under this programme, necessary survey of the damages caused by such rivers in different parts f the country will be conducted and appropriate construction works will be \\tu ndertaken. This programme also includes the Likhu river control scheme which is a part of the follow-up works of the Trisuli Watershed Development Projects. 12. Project Feasibility Studies A survey of various rivers scattered around the country, determining their potentiality and feasibility for irrigation, is included in the annual programme every year. The preliminary survey is followed by design and dost estimates for the feasible projects, followed by the preparation of the complete report of the proje ct. The main purpose of this programme is to formulate sound irrigation projects based on the water resources of the country and to provide detailed information on the techno-economic aspects of any project before it is selected for implementation. This will not only provide important data regarding the development of water resources, but will also be helpful in formulating feasible and practical projects. Under this programme various model studies, laboratory test and other work which is impossible to do in Nepal will be completed by the foreign agencies and advisory services of the foreign experts. Main studies under this programme are as follows: (a) Sunkosi Terai Project The principal objective of this project is to prepare a project report based upn feasibility studies on the Sunkosi River for the development of irrigation facilities in the central and eastern sectors of the Terai lying between the Kosi and Bagmati rivers. Therefore, a detailed study is underway with the joint efforts of His Majesty\\'s Government and the United Nations Development Programme / Special Fund. It is assumed that the proposed project can be designed to generate 75,000 Kw. Power and to irrigate about 1,00,000 hectares of land. (b) Babai Irrigation Project Babai is one of the main rivers in Bheri Zone. According to the preliminary survey, it is estimated that the project can irrigate 9,100 hectares of land in Banke and Bardia districts. During the Plan period, a feasibility study of this project will be completed, and the final report will be prepared. (c) Kankai Irrigation Project According to the preliminary report, it is estimated that this river can be harnessed to irrigate 40,500 hectares on the west bank and 32,000 hectares on the east. A feasibility study will be completed, and a detailed report will be prepared during the Plan period. (d) \\tKanchandanawa Irrigation Project The project is expected to irrigate 20,000 hectares of landing the Kapilvastu and Rupendehi districts in Lumbinin Zone. The survey work is in progress, and a detailed report and study will be completed within the Plan period. 13. Gandak East Canal The Eastern Canal in Nepal separates from the Don branch canal of the Gandak Project will provide irrigation for 69,600 hectares of land in bara, Parsa and Rautahat districts. The length of the main canal will be about 80 k.m., 600 cusecs of water will be provided. Construction work on this project is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan. 14. Gandak West Canal (Nepal) A separate head-regulator is constructed in the main dam for this canal (which is different from the main western canal flowing to India). The length of this canal will be 28.8 k.m. and can irrigate about 24,000 hectares of land in Nawalparasi district. The estimated water supply for land by this canal is 232 cusecs. 15. Chatra Field Channel This project is a part of Chatra Irrigation Project now under construction with Indian Aid. According to the agreement, the Indian Government will construct canals about 5 cusecs, while channels below 5 cusecs will be constructed by His Majesty\\'s Government. The Chatra Project will irrigate 56,500 hectares of land in Morang and Sunsari districts, and its total cost is estimated at Rs 70,00,000. The total number of channels will be approximately 800, with each ranging from 0.4 k.m. to 4.8 k.m.in length. Surveys of most of the channels have been completed. The project is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan. Tube-well Irrigation Programme Ground water resources have to be utilized where ever surface water irrigation is not possible from rivers and streams. At one time, some tube-well projects were carried out by the Government for drinking water in Kathmandu valley and in some parts of the Terai. Subsequently, 29 tube -wells were installed for irrigation in 1967-68 and 1968-69. it is noteworthy that even in the absence of necessary data from surveys and investigations of ground water resources, the above mentioned tube-wells are functioning satisfactorily. Tube-well projects will be more successful when the results of ground water resources investigations to be conducted by the Department of Hydrology are made available. Tube-well irrigation projects have some special benefits of their own, and such projects are gaining in popularity. Therefore, it has become necessary from economic and practical stand-points to utilize ground water as well as surface water for irrigation. According to the programme, 250 tube -wells will be installed in Sagarmatha, Janakpur, Narayani and Lumbini zones. Assuming that a one tube-well will irrigate 60 hectares of land on average, approximately 15,000 hectares of land will be brought under tube-well irrigation. Minor Irrigation Project Since a detailed survey of all projects to be implemented during the Fourth Plan period has not been completed and no cost estimates for such projects have been made, it is envisaged to implement 182 projects throughout the 14 zones on the basis of toposheets and preliminary surveys. The annual programme of minor irrigation will be determined in coordination with the Resettlement Programme. It is essential to recognize that a testing arrangement has to be made for the proper maintenance of completed as well as new project. SURVEY, LAND REFORM AND LAND ADMINISTRATION The land reform programme must be effectively carried out in order to create the proper atmosphere of planned development and to establish a society free from exploitation, based upon class coordination as envisaged by the Panchayat System. In the present situation, economic development cannot be generated without substantially changing agriculture, and thereby raising the living standard of the tenants no basic change in agriculture can be attained unless the tenants share equitably in agricultural output. In fact, the objective of creating the necessary conditions for attaining a society free from exploitation may remain unfulfilled unless traditional exploitation based on land is eliminated. Also, it is necessary to transfer inactive capital and under-employed labour from agriculture to industry or some other more productive sector of the economy. It is for these reasons that the current land reform programme will be implemented as a priority programme. Unless the land reform programme is effectively and properly executed, other agricultural development programmes will not be effective. The revenue survey is imperative in the establishment of some permanency in the land system and in the preparation of a register showing land-owners, tenants, and the kind of land. This information helps in the distribution of the permanent tenancy right certificates and land above ceiling. Considering these facts, the objectives and policies of the Fourth Plan are formulated to keep in view the capacity and the desired changes in the directors of survey, land reform, and land administration. Progress of the Third Plan Revenue survey work in 7,82,992 hectares of land was completed during the first four years of the Plan period, compared to the target of 10,73,418 hectares. Similarly, maintenance survey branches were set up in 16 districts instead of the targeted 22. Simplification in administration and uniformity in land management are indispensable for the attainment of the objectives of the land reform programme. Land (Administration) Offices in 13 districts were opened during the first four years of the Plan period as part of the programme to set up Lands Department in the center and Land (Administration) Offices in the districts. Objectives in the Fourth Plan The land reform programme, as a means to create a society free from exploitation and to increase agricultural production, will have the following objectives during the Plan period: a. To effectively implement the Land Reform Programme and provide better incentives to the actual tillers; It is true that if the Land Reform Department fails to properly assess and evaluate the load and nature of the work and to allocate accordingly the available manpower and resources, the programme will suffer set-backs. Also, men and materials will not be utilized to the point of maximum benefit. There have also been some problems with respect to compulsory savings collections and utilization. Revenue survey operations were not accelerated, and as a result, the distribution of permanent tenancy certificates and the appropriation and redistribution of land above prescribed ceilings have been delayed. Difficulties have also been experienced in the debt-determination and debt-redemption programmes. Because of the lack of proper coordination between the Land Reform and Agricultural Extension Programmes, there does not seem to have been any increase in agricultural productivity. Policies of the Fourth Plan Considering the above mentioned objectives of the programmes, the difficulties encountered in the past, and the working capacity of the departments, the following targets have been fixed for the Fourth Plan: 1. Revenue surveys will be completed in 44 districts (including the 18 districts already completed), and work will be started in 4 more districts. Trigonometrical and Topographical surveys will also be started in a few selected districts. 2. The distribution of Permanent Tenancy Certificates will be completed in 39 districts. 3. Land appropriation and redistribution programmes will be effectively implemented under ceiling provisions of the Land Act in this 39 districts. 4. Land (Administration) Offices will be established in these 39 districts, and the existing Land Reform Offices will be amalgamated into the new Land Offices. 5. Proper and permanent arrangements will be with respect to compulsory savings and their effective utilization. 7. The determination and realization of agricultural credit will be accomplished in all Land Reform Districts. 8. Reforms will be made in the land tax system in order to impart greater social justice and to provide  an incentive for increased production. 9. To give effect to the land to the tiller programme and also help to mobilize men and capital from the agricultural to non-agricultural sector, the existing financial institutions will be made more effective in advancing loans to farmers, provided that the farmers are going to become owner-tillers and the original proprietors are investing their money (that they got from land sold) in particular industrial projects. Such institutional credit will be provided only on the condition that real tenants will be the owner-tillers and that the land for sale will be used as security against loans advanced to the tillers whose liability to the lending corporation will be redeemed as they repay the loan in prescribed installments. 1. Survey Programme a. Cadastral Survey Revenue surveys help to levy a uniform land tax. They also pave the way for the appropriation and redistribution of land about the allowed ceiling to the landless tenants and the distribution of permanent tenancy certificates. New equipment, such as orthophoto, telescopic alidade, stadia rod, etc., will be introduced to make the revenue surveys less expensive and faster during the Plan period. The staff of the survey party team will be trained to use this new equipment. Revenue surveys will be completed in an additional 26 districts or approximately 3,37,955 hectares of land, and will be started in 4 more districts during the Plan period. A detailed programme is shown below: b. \\tTrigonometrical Survey The trigonometrical survey team will establish three trigonometrical points in the areas where revenue surveys have been completed the trigonometrical points established by the Survey of India will be systematized. Each “Amin” of the revenue survey party will have three trigonometrical points. In the beginning period, arrangements will be made for the requisite number of trigonometrical points for 7 survey team parties. The scale of the map will be uniform for all areas where the survey work has been completed. There will be no overlapping of one area above the other when there are common borders. It is estimated that the trigonometrical survey work will be completed for approximately 2,72,685 hectares of land during the Plan period. c. \\tMaintenance Survey The maintenance survey programme is important for the elimination of duplication in the completed revenue survey and for the updating of survey maps. One maintenance survey section will be established in each Land (Administration) Office. In order to keep registers up-to-date and to trace and properly care for survey maps. New records will be entered in case borders are changed due to the purchase and sale of land or some other reason. The duplication of such maps will be sold and distributed. Inspection works will be done for the maintenance of the trigonometrical points once they are fixed, and reports will have to be submitted when changes take place. The plan envisage to establish maintenance survey sections in an additional 26 districts. d. \\tTopographical Survey Topographical maps are required for the geological, soil and forest surveys. We have to depend on others for these maps, even though the available copies are inadequate. Besides, these maps are not according to our needs and the available copes are out-of-date. His Majesty\\'s Government of Nepal willendeavour to obtain United Nations Special Fund approval for setting up a topographical survey section during the Plan period. It will be entrusted with the following tasks: 1. To complete the topographical survey works of the areas, other than those undertaken by the Geological Survey of India, and the publication of one inch map sheet. 2. To reproduce one inch map sheets of Nepal in the required quantity now being published by the Survey of India and to keep the sheets up-to-date. 3. To draw and publis h up-to-date small maps of Nepal, e.g. 1:250,000. 4. To survey and produce plans of sites for development projects. 5. To print, and possibly draw, maps of surveys by other departments (e.g. Geological Survey, Soil Survey, Forest Resources Survey). The training of staff (Junior and Operating) and construction of the building will be completed during the first three years of the Plan period. Drawing and reproduction of map sheets will begin in 1974-75 and continue from that date. e. \\tTraining The importance of trained personnel can be hardly exaggerated if there is to be a fast and efficient completion of the different survey programmes. The Survey Training Centre is continuing its training programme for the staffs of the survey parties, as well as sending survey personnel to foreign countries for training. The programme of the Survey Training Centre will be expanded for training in different subjects in order to cope with the expanded activities in the revenue, trigonometrical,maintenance, and topographical surveys. 2. Land Reform Programme (a) \\tCompulsory Savings Scheme: The main and foremost objective of this programme is to accelerate the growth of the agricultural sector by transfering the inactive capital remaining in the agriculture sector to the non- agricultural sector. In addition to this, protection of tenancy rights and an end to unnecessary economic pressures on the peasants should be attempted. During the Fourth Plan period, it has been estimated that the collection of compulsory savings will amount to Rs 60 million. (b) \\tAuditing and Proper Management of Savings: The objective of land reform cannot be achieved only by collecting savings. It is very necessary to utilize the savings in an effective manner. To overcome the misappropriation of savings, it is very urgent to audit all the account records and to keep the records intact and in order. During this Plan period, the target for regular auditing of savings has been fixed at 17,019 wards. (c) \\tProtection and Proper Management of Tenancy Rights: It is very necessary to protect and secure tenancy rights, in order to increase production by providing incentive to the real tenant who is supposed to till the land. The number of temporary and permanent tenancy certificates issued up-to-date are 14,46,496 and 23,136 respectively. Unless the accurate boundaries of the land have been determined, tenancy rights certificate cannot be issued. Legal provisions have been made in the Act for the protection of such tillers from eviction. During the Fourth Plan period, permanent tenancy certificates will be issued after due enquiry and investigation on the basis of the temporary certificates. These will be issued in panchayats of the districts where the revenue survey has been completed. This will minimize litigation between the land owner and tenants, thereby restoring mutual cooperation between them. (d) \\tFixation of Rent: It is deemed compulsory to fix the amount of rent in order to provide a just share of output to the tenant who works so hard, and thereby increase total production. This sort of fixation of rent has been concentrated in the Kathmandu Valley at present. The tenant outside the Valley has no incentive to increase production by hard labour since the rent is not fixed. Therefore, during the Fourth Plan period, the rent will be fixed in those 26 districts where the revenue survey is presumed to be completed. (e) \\tAcquisition and Distribution of Land To minimize the great disparity in the distribution of land, to increase agricultural production and to create an atmosphere in which investment of inactive capital may be chanelled from the agriculture sector to the non-agricultural sector, the provision of land ceilings has been made. Those lands which are above the ceiling will be distributed to the tenants and landless peasants in order of priority. It has been difficult to distribute the excess boundaries of land above the ceiling could not be determined. For this reason, the programme of land sale and distribution will be carried out in only those 39 districts where the Revenue Survey will be completed. (f) \\tDetermination of Loan: To free the peasants from the clutches of the money lenders and other unnecessary exploitation by traditional credit systems, a programme to determine the actual amount of agricultural credit is still in operation. During the Fourth Plan period, the target has been fixed for the determination of agricultural credit to the approximate amount of Rs 40 million, out of which the remaining amount not completed during the last plan period will be calculated. 3. Land Administration Targets have been fixed to set up Land Offices (now called Land Administrative Offices) in those 26 districts where the revenue survey operation will be completed during the Fourth Plan period. (1) In the process of economic growth, the overall development programme of a landlocked country like ours can progress only with well organized and expanded transport facilities. The more inaccessible an area, the more difficult it becomes to transport men and materials. It is only through transport expansion that that development projects of all types can flourish together through mutual co-ordination and integration. The rugged topography of the country has posed a formidable problem to all sorts of transport, and because of this, even in the highly emphasized agricultural sector, production targets have not been reached. Consequently, transportation has been given top priority. Furthermore, its development is necessary to bring about efficiency and coordination in administration, to overcome regional disparity, and to mobilize scattered and surplus labour from agriculture to other sectors. (2) With the availability of cheap, speedy and far reaching transport facilities, isolated rural substances economies can now find markets and, therefore, form larger and more efficient producing units and replace barter with a cash economy. Industry can be encouraged by the greater accessibility of new resources. Communities or regions so connected and integrated become more productive and more or less self sufficient, causing inter-regional trade to grow on the basis of specialization and comparative advantage. Thus, transport development, though by no means guarantee of economic growth, does make direct and indirect contributions to national income through a more productive utilization of time and an expansion of almost all sectors of the economy. In short, transport development contributes to economic development in the following ways: (a)  Enlarging the market and thereby further stimulating economic specialization; (b)  Helping exploitation of additional resources by making them accessible and thereby enlarging employment and rehabilitation; (c)  Leading to the establishment and for expansion of related industries by making them accessible to raw materials and (d) Enhancing the optimum utilization of resources and making the means of production more dynamic. (3) Communication has its own importance, and to a larger extent, it acts as a complement to transport. Only through the expansion of communication channels, can we utilize the transport facility at its maximum capability. The need for all types of communication grows rapidly in every sector of the economy during the process of development. In fact, organized communication channels are the only way to satisfy the increasing needs. Modern life can not be imagined without a developed and modernized communication system. In spite of the importance of transport and communication, to this day historical and geographical factors divide the country into several parts; people are isolated in their villages during the rainy season because of landslides and flood. 2 Objectives: No important development programme can succeed without the proper organization of transport and communication. Their development in the Fourth Plan will be based upon the following objectives: (a) To help strengthen, promote and protect the constitutional system, nation and nationality, together with territorial integrity. (b)  To create the essential pre-conditions of transport and communication in order to implement the economic, social and other related development programmes. (c)  To open up the remote areas which have remained in isolation for centuries by providing transport and communication facilities. (d)  To speed up the pace of progress with a view to imparting an element of dynamism into society and thereby enhancing efficiency in the public and private sectors. 3. Policy: Transport will get a higher priority during the Fourth Plan period than communication. Surface roads, waterways, airways ,ropeways and railways comprise the different modes of transportation, although it is not possible to consider them as equally important. Therefore, the type of transport, which is most speedy and stable and yields the quickest returns will be emphasized. The rugged terrain of the country has limited the expansion of railways, and within this Plan period, only a necessary feasibility survey will be undertaken. Air transportation, though expensive and primarily beneficial to only a section of the well-to-do-class, will nevertheless be extended as a temporary measure to all those economically feasible areas, as well as to those places necessary from an administrative or tourist point of view. Therefore, air transport has been given second priority after roads. River navigation, as a solution to our transport problem, is unfeasible because of the rugged topography. Ropeway extension in the hills looks attractive on theoretical ground, but not from a cost-benefit point of view. Since roads are the most dependable means of transport, the emphasis in the near future will be given to the construction of roads. In the field of communication, telecommunication and postal services will be given due consideration. So far, postal service is the only means which is serving the majority of the population. Its need is continuously increasing because of the increase in transport extension and educational facilities. Efforts will be made to make available cheaper and speedy services throughout the country by the improvement and expansion of postal services. Moreover, various types of telecommunication services will be established, considering the growing international relations together with the development of industry, trade and tourism. 4. Introduction to Road Development: The National Planning Commission has based the road development programme of Fourth Plan on the “20 year Highway Plan in Nepal”. Keeping in mind the unique topography and the limited resources in hand, all the districts and zonal headquarters will be linked by motorable road in accordance with the long- term plan. Since road building is a time consuming process, it would be unreasonable to tie our hands without proceeding with some transport development work in those districts where road construction is supposed to continue in future. Attention will therefore be devoted not only to the construction of existing roads, but also to the improvement of primitive tracks and the construction of new ones. In this context, efforts will be made to prepare maps with the cost estimates of various roads in the country. In order to provide swift and efficient administration, the entire road network has been classified in the following manner: Highway  Trunk Road Road Jeep track Mule track Foot track  sIn view of the need for a  table and strong organization for the proper development and maintenance of roads, three categories of roads have been devised so that minimum requirements for construction and maintenance are fulfilled. This has been done because further classification is considered unnecessary at present. 1. Highway: Roads, which are considered to be strategic from a national view point are included in this category. All highways should have the recommended width, sub-base and local bearing capacity. His Majesty’s Government (HMG) will assume the responsibility for construction and maintenance. 2. Main road: Roads, which are less important and shorter than the highway, but like several districts and zones are included in this category. HMG will decide the minimum standards, both physical and technical, for these roads. The task of repairing and maintenance will rest with the local authorities of HMG. 3. Freeder road: Roads, which are generally short in distance when compared with the main road and connect only one or two districts and which are only important locally are included in this category. The road surface will be black topped, graveled, or unmetalled according to the region. HMG will take the appropriate steps for the maintenance of such roads, including the complete inventory of road lists. The local authorities will also share some responsibility in this matter. Even a concentrated road building effort will not complete the project in a short period due to complete neglect for a century. Keeping in view the ideal goal of planning to serve all the people, appropriate steps will be taken to develop and facilitate the transport system in the remote areas where motorable road construction has not yet been feasible. Henceforth it has been necessary to classify those transport facilities which provide for the movement of mules and people a ‘foot and bridle path’. Most of the transport facilities available in the country are in this condition. In the Terai, there are similar narrow tracks called “Pagdandi”. The sole responsibility and maintenance of such tracks will lie with the Panchayats themselves. For the present, necessary maintenance and improvement will be undertaken in most remote areas as required and the standard of mule -tracks will also be improved. The tracks where the movement of carts and jeeps is possible are included in this category. Such tracks will help to link village and farms on the one hand and villages and markets on the other- especially in the Terai region. In the First Plan (1956/57-60/61), the target set for road construction was 1,440 Km. which included 480 Km. All-weather and 960 Km. In the First Plan (1956/57-60/61), the target set for road construction was 1,440 Km. which included 480 Km. All-weather and 960 Km. Fair-weather roads. According to the revised target of the Third Plan (1965-70), it was envisaged to construct 1,365 kilometers of roads, including 753 kilometers all-weather and 607 kilometers fair-weather. Out of this, 1,009 kilometer or 80 per cent of the target has been achieved including 405 Km. black top, 230 Km. gravel, and 455 Km. fair-weather roads. By the end of the Third Plan 83 Km. fair-weather, 110 Km. gravel and 43 Km. black top were completed. Completion of this road inter-link the area of greatest potential development in the east. This will help the industrial areas of Mechi, Koshi, and Janakpur zones, take full advantage of the highway, thereby, enhancing the volume of their internal trade as well facilitate the transportation of raw materials needed for local industries. In this highway there will be 119 major and minor bridges, 1,500 culverts, and 52 causeways. The process of black topping the 23 kilometre fair-weather road which connects Jaleshwor with Janakpur will be completed in the first year of the Fourth Plan. This project was started in the year 1968- 69. Completion of this road will connect and therefore contribute and a great deal to the industrial areas of the Eastern Terai. A (2) Kamala bridge: However, its need in the past has not been mentioned anywhere. In the absence of this bridge, the entire utility of the East-West Highway would be reduced. Consequently, the construction this bridge will be completed during the Fourth Plan. A (3) Simra-Janakpur (Dhalkewar-Pathlaiya): However, because of several factors, it was possible to complete only 28 kilometres of black top and 26 kilometres gravel and two other bridges during the third plan. During fourth plan, it has been envisaged to complete the entire road in black top. Completion of this road will link the important areas of Janakpur and Narayani zones. Besides this, the sector to be constructed with Indian co-operation stretching from Jhapa to Janakpur will be ready in 1971 and will help to bring together the people of Jhapa and Kathmandu by increasing cultural contacts. Up to Bagmati, 8 major bridges and 72 small bridges and culverts are needed. From Bagmati onwards, another 17 major bridges and 50 minor bridges and culverts are estimated to be required. A (4) Narayangarh-Butwal: The existing portion of the Mahendra Highway from Narayanghat west to Butwal was supposed to be built as a fair-weather road in the Third Plan with the assistance and credit to British Government. The 122 kilometers road will be converted to black top by the end of this Plan period. This will link the Narayani and Lumbini zones together with creating an area of potential development in central Nepal. A (5) Prithvi Highway: This project was begun in 1967-68 with Chinese Aid During the Third Plan, out of 176 kilometres, 20 kilometre of gravelling had been completed, and the first jeep has already reached Pokhara. The entire length of the road will be gravelled by the first half of the Fourth Plan. Completion of this road will connect the central hilly regions of Bagmati, Narayani and Gandaki zones. This will facilitate the growth of horticulture centers and other similar development projects in turn increasing the standard of living of the local people. This road will also carry both tourists and pilgrims to Bandipur, Gorkha and Manakamana areas and will contribute towards increasing the national income. A. (6) Dhangarhi-Dadheldura: The construction of 145 kilometres from Dhangarhi to Dadheldhura was started during the Third Plan, partially under American assistance. Sixty-five kilometres of fair-weather road were completed, both in the Terai and Hilly regions, by the last year of the Third Plan. The entire length of the road will be gravelled by the fourth year of the Plan. This road will connect the food deficit areas of the Far Western Hills, such as Doti, Baitadi, Achham and Bajura with the Terai. This will also increase national and per capita income. Moreever, this road will bring the hinterland of Dhadeldura very close and will act as a forward link to Doti, Baitadi, Achham, Darchula, Bajura and Bajhang. (7) Bhaktapur-Kathmandu: The number of passengers traveling daily along this route is approximately 5,641 by 31 buses. In fact, large quantities of vegetables and other food stuffs required in Kathmandu are supplied by areas served by this route. T his route has facilitated the growth of inter-regional trade between Banepa, Dhulikhel, Of late, this road between Bhagtapur and Kathmandu has become quite narrow  and congested because of the increasing volume of traffic. This has resulted in significant inconveniences to passengers and increased dangers from accidents. In addition, the operating costs of the vehicles have increased considerably. Consequently, the increased cost in diesel and petrol alone has amounted to Rs 500,000 annually. Thus, as an alternative, a new road has been under construction with Chinese assistance from Thapathali to Bhaktapur since the fourth year of the Third Plan. The entire length of the 13 kilometer road will be black-topped during the first year of the Fourth Plan. Completion of this road will not only help the passengers, but will also reduce the operating costs and contribute indirectly to an national income. B. The 437 kilometer road from Nepalgung (Kohalapur) to Banwasa comprises the remaining section of the Mahendra Highway. Of this, 200 kilometers will be graveled and the remaining 237 Km. will be rair-weather road. (1) Remaining portion of the Mahendra Highway in the western side of Butwal The main centers to which agricultural products are brought down from the hills or produced and collected for marketing in the Terai are Nepalgunj, Rajapur, Dhangarhi and Mahendranagar. These serve both as export centers for agricultural commodities and import-centres for consumer foods from India. Mahendranagar is a flourishing trade center but because of transport difficulties, it conducts all of its trade with India instead of the Terai area to the east. Completion of this road will facilitate the linking of the districts of Seti, Bheri, Mahakali and Terai portion of Rapti and Lubini zones, as well as helping to increase the exporting capacity of these areas. The need for this highway has also been regarded as most urgent because it will connect important parts of the country: i.e., the hills with the resource rich area in the East and West Terai. The road would also help to integrate the economies of these areas. B. (2) Hetauda-Narayangarh and Narayani Bridge: In the Third Plan, survey and investigation work were completed for the raising of the Hetauda- Narayangarh road to highway standards. This road is a connecting link to the Mahendra Highway in the Western sector. The construction work on this 83 kilometers long highway will be black topped by 1974-75, along with the improved bridges and culverts which are needed. Appropriate arrangements will be made to continue transportation across the Narayani river. There has been a ferry-service across this river for some time. During the Third Plan, an economic and technical investigation reached the final stage, and during the Fourth Plan, either a bridge or a ferry will be established, depending upon the recommendations of the report. C.  Growth Axis Roads construction Because of the excessive mountain terrain on the Northern part of Nepal and the low land of the Terai, the occupations, production, and potentiality of these areas are basically different. A north-south road has, therefore, become essential to facilitate the movement of complementary products from the hills to the Terai and Terai to the hills. Accordingly, road, facilities, as a stimulus to “ Regional development”, will be made available to Jumla in the Karnali region, Jomsom in the Gandaki region, Dhunche and Barabise in the Bagmati region, and Khandbari in the Kosi region. The total length of such roads is estimated to be 84o kilometers of which 254 kilometers will be constructed in the Fourth Plan. In the Bagamati region, since the road linking Barabise is already in, service only the following road projects will be undertaken. C. (1) Nepalgunj-Jumla: This road is a part of the Western trunk route which will pass from Kholapur to Jumla, connecting Surkhet, Kalikot and Dhailekh. The total length will be 250 kilometres. Furthermore, the limited land resources and low producticity in the hills have made people move in search of employment and trade opportunities in the Surkhet, Dang and Nepalgunj areas. This will shift the population from Dailekh, Jumla and the surrounding areas to Surkhet, Dang and Nepalgunj, thereby giving rise to likely population problems in the future. Therefore, construction of this road can help in the establishment of small development projects which, in turn, will partially help to solve the unemployment problem. In the Fourth Plan, 77 kilometres of road connecting Nepalgunj and Surkhet will be constructed. Since Nepalgunj is the trading center of western Nepal, road will open up the surrounding districts and enable them to expand their trade. C. (2) Putalikhet-Baglung-Tukuche -Jomsom: This is a feeder road of the Siddhartha Highway, connecting Bhairahawa, Palpa, Syangja, Pokhara, Balgunj, Tukuche and Jomsom in Mustang district. With exception of one STOL airfield in Jomsom, other modern means of transport are not available in this area. This has, therefore, been considered to be an inaccessible area. Construction of this road will also help develop tourism, as well as enable a greater inflow of pilgrims to Muktinath. It will help develop the surrounding villages as well. During the Fourth Plan, 80 kilometres of this road from Putalikhet to Baglung will be constructed. C. (3) Trishuli-Dhunche-Gatlang: Although the route to Dhunche passing through Birgunj, Hetauda, Kathmandu and Trishuli was mentioned in the policy guidelines of the draft of the Fourth Plan, the economic and technical survey found this route to be unfeasible. The total length of this route will be 150 kilometres of which the 70 kilometres from Kathmandu to Trishuli is already in existence as a fair-weather road, which will be black topped in the Fourth Plan. Thus from Trishuli to Gatlang, 80 kilometres must be constructed. During the Fourth Plan, 35 kilometres of jeepable track from Trishuli to Dhunche will be constructed on a fair-weather basis. With this road construction dairy, horticulture, and other activities can be developed. Moreover, the facility will attract a greater number of tourists and pilgrims to Gosainkunda. This road can further help to exploit the unutilized timber resources of Gatlang areas-amounting annually to approximately 2 million cu. ft., with Kathmandu serving as a potential market. C. (4) Dharan-Dhankuta-Khandhari: This route will provide limited modern transport facilities to the local people of Sankhuwasabha, Taplejung, Terathum, Dhankuta, Bhojpur and the surrounding districts. With regard to modern transport facilities, there is only one airfield at Tumlingtar. In the Fourth Plan, the 72 kilometres from Dharan to Dhankuta will be made motorable for general vehicles. This will solve to some extent the transport problem in the districts of Dhankuta, Terathum, Sankhuwasha, Taplejung and Bhojpur. This will stimulate the local people to develop the more profitable horticulture farmings instead of cereal foods as a source of enhancing their income. In the future, Dhankuta can become a citrus fruit center, having a linkage effect upon other districts as well. The completion of this road will facilitate the development of adjoining areas and also lessen regional disparities. D.  Inter-district and Intra-district roads: The Eastern Terai portion of the Mahendra Highway and a portion of the Prithvi Highway in the hills are already in service. In order to make these roads more important economically, the market centers, populous areas and provide transport facilities in and between districts for social reasons. The present highway, now under construction, is away from the market centers and other productive areas. Therefore, during the Fourth Plan period, it has become necessary to construct feeder roads to link the productive areas and populous regions with the highways. Under this programme, Jhapa, Kapilvastu and Rautahat in the Terai, Dang in Inner Terai and Chautara and Gorkha in the hills have been given prime consideration. The total length of these roads constructed during the Plan be 150 kilometres of gravelled surface. Details are as follows: (1)  Gorkha-Prithvi Highway: Gorkha currently supplies some of its surplus products to Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Dhading, Lamjung, Tanahun and Kaski districts. The interconnection of these districts through the development of road will quicken the pace of economic development as well as increase the standard of living of the local people. Its historical background and natural beauty have made Gorkha a potential tourist centers. It will be feeder road to the Prithvi Highway. (2)  Chautara-Araniko (Kodari) Highway: A fair-weather jeepable track connecting the Araniko Highway with Chautara has already been constructed in Sindhupalchok district with voluntary labour of the people. This district has partially supplied the growing demand for meat and fish in Kathmandu. The conversion of this road to an all-wrather one will enable it to bear large vehicles, thereby extending the market for market for fruits and ghee of this area. In addition, there are favourable prospects for the development and promotion of the cheese industry. During the Plan period, the existing road will be gravelled and its width increased. The total length of this road will be 26 kilometres. (3)  Gaur-Mahendra Highway: This area through which the road will pass is the most fertile in Rautahat district. However, the lack of markets has restricted the promotion and development of local products. Moreover, cash crop like sugarcane are grown to a greater extent because they are easily irrigated by the Bagmati river. In the Plan period, a feeder road from Mahendra Highway to Gaur will be constructed. The total length of 33 kilometres will be graveled. Completion of this road will enable products from this district to have access to markets. It will be easier for Birgunj Sugar Factory to run at full capacity because the road will connect it to the sugarcane growing areas in Gaur. (4)  Krishnanagar-Bahadurgunj-Mahendra Highway: Krishnanagar and Bahadurgunj are important among the trade centers and other notable areas of the Western Terai. Even in terms of population, those notable two towns rank high in the region, They cater to the export and import trade of hilly districts such as Piuthan and Argakhanchi. Therefore, it has become extremely necessary to connect these areas with the hilly districts through proper roads. The important exports from these areas are paddy, sugarcane and timber. In Krishnanagar alone, approximately 2,000 hectares are under sugarcane cultivation. The past plans have encouraged the growth of small development projects in these areas. Consequently, the need to interconnect these regions by road has become greater. Therefore, within the Fourth Plan, a 20 kilometre gravelled road will connect Krishnanagar and Bahadurgunj with Mahendra Highway in such a way that it could be further extended to the hills in the north in the future. (5)  Dang-Mahendra Highway: Dang districts in the Rapti Zone in the Western Inner Terai acts as a trading center of the hilly districts of Sallyan, Piuthan, Rukum and Rolpa. A large amount of paddy, rice and ghee are exported through this route. Presently, transport bottlenecks have prevented the local products from selling at higher prices. Thus, a 16 kilometre gravelled feeder road from Dang to Mahendra Highway will be constructed. Construction of this road will help take the local products to better markets as well as help improve the standard of living. (6)  Chandragadhi-Mahendra Highway: Chandragadhi is the headquarter of the Jhapa district in Mechi Zone. In fact, this district is the most prosperious and fertile in all of Nepal. Jhapa district by itself produces 10 per cent of the total paddy production of the entire country. The completion of the Mahendra Highway will certainly help to augment internal and external trade, however, this goal will remain unfulfilled until a feeder road from Dhulabari to the most fertile area in the south is constructed. Therefore, in this Plan,16 kilometres of gravelled road from Dhulabari to Chandragadhi will be constructed. Completion of this road will help the establishment of jute processing, paper and other allied industries. (7)  Rajbiraj-Mahendra Highway: Rajbiraj has its own importance as the headquarters of Sagarmatha Zone. Chandra canal and other such irrigation facilities have made this area very fertile and densely populated. In addition to paddy, large quantities of raw jute, mustard, timber and other goods are exported to India. The present Mahendra Highway which passes through Lahan provides a prospective market for the local products of Udaipur and other hilly districts. This will also add to the income of the local people. Feeder road construction from Rajbiraj to Mahendra Highway will facilitate the movement of food grains. Consequently, in this Plan period, 14 kilometres of gravelled roads from Rajbiraj to Mahendra Highway will be constructed. E.  Urban Roads: Under this project, 25 kilometres of black topped road will be constructed in Kathmandu and other urban areas. The details are as follows: E.(1) Kathmandu Valley Roads: Kathmandu is important for many reasons. As the capital of the country Kathmandu’s urban population has been rapidly increasing. The number of vehicles registered has increased from 1,845 in 1958 to 6,710 in 1968. However, the road capacity in Kathmandu has not increased at the same rate. It has therefore been planned to increase the capacity of the roads as well as to upgrade some roads by black topping. E.(2) Other Urban Roads : In accordance with needs, the existing fair-weather roads of other urban areas will also be black topped. F.  Roads to be completed after the Feasibility Survey: The World Bank team will conduct a technical and economic feasibility survey for roads throughout the country. In this Plan, about 100 kilometres of gravelled roads will be constructed according to the priorities of the survey report. The following roads have also been included in the survey: F.(1) Lahan-Okhaldhunga: It has been estimated that the districts of Sagarmatha Zone (especially Okhaldhunga) have been facing deficits of about 7,677 metric tons of food-grain every year. Lahan has been considered to be a main market center to this area for both social and economic reasons. Potatoes and fruits are grown in Udaipur and Okhaldhunga, but only for local consumption. F.(2) Kathmandu-Simra: The volume of traffic and the danger of accidents on the Tribhuwan Highway have increased considerably. Also, the long route passing through steep hills and sharp bends has led to greater fuel consumption and shortened the lives of vehicles.This has brought to light the need for an alternative to the Tribhuban Rajpath which will be shorter, more comfortable, and more economic. The length of this road will be 96 kilometres instead of the 144 kilometers of the Tribhuban Rajpath. F.(3) Dang-Jajarkot: Substantial amounts of food-grain, fruits, ghee, and other items are exported to India through Koilabas. Transport difficulties have posed a formidable problem to move the foodgrain to deficit areas like Jajarkot and Sallyan. Oranges are grown in the districts of Sallyan and Jajarkot, and there is good potential for the development of these export-oriented horticultural products. If the linking of this road is possible, there are chances for the growth of a needed organized market which will promote exports of these products. F.(4) Jhapa-Taplejung: Both Illam and Taplejung are deficit in food-grains. Illam alone imports about 2,728 metric tons of food-grains from surplus areas of the country. Simultaneously, Jhapa exports 60,000 metric tons of food- grains to India every year. If suitable transportation were available, food-grains could easily be sent from Jhapa to these deficit districts in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost. Also, there is the possibility of setting up a herb extraction plant in Taplejung which has a significant export potential. There is also potential for the development of potatoes, fruits, and tea farming in Illam with good markets in India. F.(5) Narayanghat-Prithvi Highway (Muglinphant): Narayanghat, a small town in Chitwan, is flourishing as an important center of trade and industrial activity. It has also absorbed large numbers of settlers from Gorkha, Bandipur and other surrounding hilly areas. Development projects, such as the Rapti Valley Project has also generated some economic activity in this region. Presently, Narayanghat is serving as the main food-grain market center for the hilly regions of Bandipur and Gorkha. Substantial amount of mustard and timber are also exported from this area. Narayanghat Bazar is only 25 Km. away from Muglinphant, a village on the Prithvi Highwaay. Opening a feeder road from Narayanghat to Muglinphant will link the districts of Lumbini, Gandaki and Bagmati zones. Besides, a straight route would be opened between Birgunj and Pokhara on the one hand and Bhairahawa and Kathmandu on the other. Moreover, this will provide a more convenient and speedy route than the Tribhuban Highway it is about 200 kilometers to Kathmandu. However, by the new route coming up from Narayanghat via the Prithvi Highway, it will be about 135 kilometers only. In addition, this will facilitate food-grain movement at fair prices from Chitwan and Nawalparasi to Bandipur, Gorkha, Tanahu and Pokhara during times of food shortage. F.(6) Banepa- Sindhuli-Dhalkewar: It has not only caused many inconveniences to the people, but also led to the wasting of national resources. Thus, it has become essential to link Kathmandu with Janakpur through Banepa, Sindhuli and Dhalkewar. This will serve as another arterial route from Kathmandu to other parts of the Eastern Terai region. It will facilitate the movement of man and material, as well as reduce the pressure of accidents on the Tribhuban Highway. For the districts of Janakpur Zone, the road will serve as a base for development. Also, from an economic point of view, a road will help in extending the trade of Ramechhap, Dhulikhel and Dolkha and other hilly regions with other Terai centers and Indian markets. G.  Foot tracks, Mule tracks and Jeep tracks: The road development programme to be initiated in the Fourth Plan will not, however, connect all parts of the country by motorable roads. Thus with the exception of Kathmandu, the Terai and some other parts of the hills, the need for foot and mule tracks will remain for some decades to come. The total length of such trails in Nepal has been estimated to be 10,000 kilometers. I.  Bridges and Culverts Construction and Improvement: The growing need for bridges and culverts in all parts of a country like Nepal which is surrounded by rivers and streams, is indisputable. But it is evident that limited resources do not permit us to construct and improve bridges in all places at the same time Therefore, HMG will construct bridges over those rivers with the greatest traffic. In addition, alternative routes will be considered keeping in view the volume of traffic. Also, four worn-out bridges in Kathmandu which are not capable of bearing any further heavy load will be replaced and constructed according to a new standard. J. Due to a rapid increase in the volume of men and materials, and the use heavy vehicles, about 400 kilometers of roads which were classified as substandard in the Third plan will be improved considerably. j. (1) Raxaul-Hetauda and Kathmandu-Hetauda (Tribhuvan Highway) J (2) Kathmandu –Trisuli: During the Fourth Plan, the gravel road will be converted into black top. K.  Miscellaneous: It has become quite essential to improve the methodology of the formulation of development projects during the process of development. Therefore, in the Plan, proper arrangements will be made for studying the construction of new roads. The report available from this study will certainly form a dependable base for this Plan, and more particularly, for the Fifth Plan. By the end of this Plan, more black top roads will be ready, although they may not be able to meet our requirements. Future generations can receive the benefits only when these roads are properly maintained. “Therefore, due consideration will be given to the protection and maintenance of the national road network. Attention has been given to making the Road Department more efficient by saving expensive and modern equipments. However, arrangements will be made to provide the essential equipments. Since road construction has been carried out on the basis of the knowledge and experience of other countries, construction materials, equipment, and techniques have accordingly been foreign. Therefore, a construction material laboratory for testing the utility of construction materials will be established. Thus, if these facilities can be developed properly, it will lead to reduced construction costs for road development through the utilization of local materials and the savings of foreign exchange. In order to complete these programmes, the decision will be finalized after necessary consultation with the U.N.D.P. Special Fund and I.D.A. During the Fourth Plan it is hoped to complete the entire programme. Financial Outlay, Past and Present: 1. From the very beginning of planning in Nepal, the road development programme has been given top priority. In the First Plan, out of a total 330 million rupees, 111.5 million rupees was earmarked for the development of transport and communications. By the end of First Plan, 94.9 million rupees or 85 per cent of the total outlay were actually spent. Investment and expenditure in the field of transport and communication are given below: ** Includes (1) Gorkha -Prithvi Highway (2) Chantara-Araniko Highw ay (3) Gaur-Mahendra Highway & other regional roads. *** Includes Bardiya, Bhojpur, Gulmi, Illam, Dailekh, Sindhuli, Taplejung, Sankhuwasava, Solukhumbu, Dolakha, Sindhupalchowk, Rasuwa, Dhading, Gorkha, Manang, Mustang, Dolpa, Tribrikokt, Jumla, Mugh, Humla, Bhajang, Darchula & Baitadi. NATIONAL TRANSPORT CORPORATION The primary aim of this corporation is to play the leading role in traffic operation. In accordance with these policies, the Transport Corporation has included the following projects in the Fourth Plan: 1. Extension of Truck and Bus services in the Siddartha (Sunouli-Pokhara) and other highways: 2. Extension of Railways (if justified by feasibility study) Railway services are constructed to be one of the important means of transport. It has occupied a prominent role in the transportation system of neighbouring countries. In Nepal, it has been possible to operate railway services in only two places because of the high costs of construction and maintenance. The railway services operating between Amlekhjung and Raxaul (N.G.R.) has virtually closed down since the development of parallel surface road in the area. On the other hand the Janakpur-Jayanagar railway service is operating successfully and has been further extended. In the context of highways expansion, there seems to be little ground for the further development of railways, although necessary surveys will be undertaken to study the expansion of such services to feasible areas. In this regard, the feasibility survey for construction of a broad gauge railway line between Raxaul and Hetauda and Hetauda and Kathmandu will be completed. A feasibility study will also be undertaken for the extension of railway line from Mahinathpur to Chisapani. 3. Operation of Trollybus (if justified by feasibility study) This bus is operated with the use of hydro- electric power. Since the supply of hydro electric - power in the country is increasing and the need for large quantities of diesel and petrol have necessitated dependence upon foreign countries, it might be more economic to develop a transport system based upon the utilization of power. An initial survey will be done about setting up an electrical trolly bus service along Kathmandu-Bhaktapur route. this route has a large volume of traffic and a wide road is recently being constructed. Attempts will be made to operate an electric trolly bus service if it is found to be feasible by the study. Similar surveys will be done in other parts of the country if this project is found to be feasible. 4. Financial Outlay: It is estimated that Rs 2.6 million will be required  f or the implementation of the above mentioned projects. (1) Purchase of additional trucks  Rs 2.4 million (2) Survey for railway (Raxaul-Kathmandu ) and feasibility study of electric bus service  Rs 0.1 million CHAPTER XI CIVIL AVIATION The importance of civil aviation is providing easy and speedy transportation facilities to the remote and inaccessible areas of Nepal is steadily increasing. It is difficult to provide road transportation facilities in a short pe riod of time to every district in a rugged country like Nepal. Since a long time is often needed (especially in the initial stages of the construction of roads in the hilly terrans), it has become essential to operate air services in these regions before making road facilities available. Efforts will thus be continued during the Fourth Plan period to make available air services in those districts which are considered most essential from the point of view of economic, social, administrative and national deve lopment and to eliminate the transport bottlenecks which have been standing as a stumbling-block to the overall development of the country. These has been encouraging development in the fields of civil aviation in the past few years. Air service at the present time is not limited to domestic flights and flights to India. Services are linked to Pakistan, Burma and Thailand illustrating an encouraging entry of Nepal into international air-service. In this regard, some of the existing airfields will be improved and extended, making the take -off and landing of large jet aircrafts possible. Some other airports will be modernized and renovated as required and will be provided with communication facilities, aerial navigation instruments and buildings. Progress in the preceeding Plan period: Prior to the beginning of the First Plan period, air service was available to only five places in the country. Among these airfields, Kathmandu airport was the only all-weather one. During the First Plan period, new fair-weather airfields were constructed at seven additional sites: Bharatpur, Dhangadi, Nepalgunj, Dang, Janakpur and Palungtar. By the end of the First Plan period, twelve airfields were constructed at twelve different places in the country. In addition, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) was established in the year 1959 to provide regular air service. Improvements were also made on the major airfields of the country: Kathmandu, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar. the Second Plan period, the construction of three additional fair\\tIn\\t-weather airfields was envisaged, but only one in Jhapa was actually constructed. STOL fields were constructed in Jumla, Jiri and Baglung. In addition, the airports of Janakpur and Bhairahawa were largely converted into all-weather ones. Similarly, the improvement of Biratnagar airport and the construc tion of 2,012 metre-long (6600 ft.) cross runway at Kathmandu were almost completed. The progress achieved in the first four years of the Third Plan in the field of Civil Aviation was in accordance with the plan targets, except for STOL airstrip construction. The carry-over projects from the Second Plan were also completed during the Third Plan period. In addition, a taxiway, apron, car parking area, and terminal building have been constructed. The old terminal building has been expanded and made available to the passengers of external flights. A new and separate terminal building for interna l passengers has been completed. The design and estimates of a fire house and a transmitter receiving station were also completed. During the Plan period Biratnagar, Janakpur and Bhairahawa airports were converted into all-weather ones. Apart from this, efforts were made to provide additional facilities at Simra, Dang, Jhapa, Bharatpur, Dhangadi and other airports. In the First Plan Rs 6 million were allocated for various development projects in the field of civil aviation. The actual expenditure during the Plan period, was Rs 7.071 million. During the Second Plan it was envisaged to spend Rs 25 million, but the actual expenditure amounted to only Rs 15.996 million. The expenditure by the fourth year of the Plan was estimated to be Rs 53.482 million. The projects incorporated in the Fourth Plan: Nineteen different projects will be implemented for the development of civil aviation during the Fourth Plan period. These projects deal with the extension and construction of new airports. The existing airfields will also be equipped with communication, navigational aid, and other facilities. To implement these projects, Rs 161 million has been allocated during the Plan period. In addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will make available a loan of Rs 60.701 million and technical assistance worth Rs 3.535 million for development of the airports at Tribhuban (Kathmandu), Pokhara, Simra, Biratnagar and Bhairahawa. 1. Tribhuban Airport: The regular service of large aircrafts like Fokker, Caravelle and DC-9s has already begun at the airport. Since such services are expected to be continued in the future, this airport will be converted into an international airport. The present runway will be expanded to 3,048 metres from the present length of 1,036 metres. In addition, the internal and external terminal buildings, the control tower, the cargo terminal, the approach road, the car parking areas, the hangar and other buildings will be constructed. This project is estimated to cost Rs 43.836 million. 2. Pokhara, Simra and Nepalgunj airports: During the Plan period, new airports will be constructed in Pokhara, Simra and Nepalgunj. The runway of these airports will be 1,524, 2,286 and 1,524 meters (5,000 ft., 7,500 ft., and 5,000 ft.) respectively. New sites will be required for their construction, since the present airfields are not suitable for further extension. In these airport, taxiway, terminal building, staff quarters, workshop communication and fire station buildings fuel storage etc. will be constructed. Pokhara: After Tribhuban airport, Pokhara is the second busiest airport in the hilly region of Nepal. Recently, the increase in economic activity and the growing demand for air service to Pokhara has made the operating of planes bigger than DC-3 necessary. It has been planned to construct an airport with a 1,524 metre (5,000 ft.) runway at a suitable site. It is estimated that Rs 24.087 million will be spent during this Plan period for the various works to be undertaken for the development of Pokhara airport. Simra: Simra airport is the nearest to Kathmandu and has thus become essential to construct it as an alternative to Tribhuban Airport. In case the jet aircraft cannot land at Tribhuban airport, this airport will be used as the alternative- landing site. The cost of the major construction work to be undertaken at this airport is to be Rs 29.7825 million during the Fourth Plan period. Nepaljung: Nepaljung occupies on important place in the development of far western Nepal. It is not only the main center for importing and exporting in this area, but also the transportation center for the extension of different development projects. Moreover, it is centrally located between Dhangadi in the west, Surkhet in the north and Dang in the east and acts as an operating base for STOL service in that region. It is estimated that Rs 16.045 million will be spent for this purpose. 3. All-weather airport at Biratnagar and Bhairahawa: The runways in Biratnagar and Bhairahawa airports will be extended to 1,525 meter (5,000 ft.). The approach roads and terminal buildings will also be renovated. These projects are estimated to cost about Rs 29.51-125 million. During this Plan period Rs 14.756 million will be spent for each airport. 4. Tumlingtar Fair-weather airport: The construction of a runway at Tumlingtar airport was begun during the Third Plan period in hopes of providing Dacota (DC-3) air service to the Eastern hilly region of Nepal. The completion of this airport is envisaged during the Fourth Plan period. For this purpose, about Rs 2,60,000 will be spent in the Plan period. This airport will provide additional transport facilities to the inaccessible areas of Mechi, Khoshi and Sagarmatha Zones. 5. Improvements and Additional Facilities: In addition to the above mentioned airports, airfields at Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Jhapa, Plaungtar, Bharatpur, Dang, Dhangadi and Surkhet will be modernized and equipped with staff-quarters, fire- stations, N.D.B., and generator building, etc. The implementation of this calls for Rs 3,271,525 which includes Rs 775,000 for Janakpur, Rs 465,000 for Rajbiraj, Rs 911,525 for Jhapa, Rs 80,000 for Palungtar, Rs 140,000 for Bharatpur, Rs 130,000 for Dang, Rs 340,000 for Dhangadi and Rs 430,000 for Surkhet airfield. 6. Short take-off and landing (STOL) airstrips: STOL air services play an important role in the provision of transportation facilities to Nepal’s inaccessible hilly regions, where big aircrafts cannot land. In addition, 19 other airstrips constructed by voluntary labour from the local people are now under regulations of the Department. At present, there are 24 such STOL air- fields in the Kingdom. The three airstrips at Jumla, Baglung and Lamidanda of Khotang have been constructed by the Department, and two other airstrips at Dipayal in Doti and Safebazar in Accham, are now being renovated by the Department. In addition, 19 other airstrips constructed by voluntary labour from the local people are now under regulations of the Department. In the Fourth Plan 10 additional airstrips will be constructed in Baitadi, Bhajang, Humla, Dailekh, Dolpa, Tribikot, Bhajura, Rukum, Jomsom and one district in Mechi zone. This project are estimated to cost Rs 5,520,000. Airstrips will be constructed only on those sites which are found by surveys to be feasible. During the Second Plan, it was planned to construct 20 STOL airstrips but the construction of only four such strips was completed. The target of the Third Plan for the construction of STOL airstrips was also revised and the number of airstrips to be constructed was reduced from 20 to 11. The progress achieved so far in this field is not encouraging. Therefore, the target in the Fourth Plan has not been ambitious so that it can be totally achieved. 7. Provision of communication and navigational aid: The provision of communication and navigational aid will be undertaken in this Plan period in order to make air service more secure and efficient. Such facilities have already been provided in Kathmandu and seven other places. However, the airfields still need them. The airfields that have already been navigational aids are not fully equipped at present. These airfields will be provided with the necessary communication and other materials. This project is estimated to cost Rs 6.9 million. 8. Administrative building: The need for an administrative building for the Department has been felt for a long time. Construction of it is planned during the Fourth Plan period, and it is estimated to cost Rs 400,000. 9. Other Arrangements: Arrangements for the provision of necessary furniture, means of transport, and other machines and equipments for maintenance will also be made at different airports. For this purpose a sum of Rs 1,386,474 (including Rs 250,000 for furniture, Rs 400,000 for means of transport and Rs 736,475 for the maintenance of equipment) has been earmarked in the Fourth Plan. 10. Manpower: To implement the above projects an addition of 271 individuals will be required. THE ROYAL NEPAL AIRLINES CORPORATION (R.N.A.C.) Air service is considered a necessity in every country. Therefore, His Majesty’s Government has given due priority to air services and has been taking the necessary steps in acquiring aircrafts as well as constructing airports. Recently an agreement was reached between His Majesty’s Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the development of civil aviation. Realizing the importance of civil aviation, His Majesty’s Government has made a programme for spending more than 160 million in the Fourth Plan period. The Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has provided air transport to the remote areas of the country. To give essential to the increasing tourist industry of the country, to strengthen individually and to continue mutual co-operation in the international field, there is a great need to improve and extend the external service of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation. This will contribute especially to the earning of foreign exchange. In view of these facts, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has envisaged a plan to implement the following projects during the Fourth Plan period. (a) Purchase of medium size Jet planes. (b) Purchase of STOL aircrafts. (c) Construction and maintenance of workshop and simulator and purchase of passenger buses. (d) At present only DC-3 planes are being used in the internal service. In the Fourth Plan period, planes like the Avro 748 will be introduced for internal services, as well. (e) The existing external services to Patna, Delhi and Dacca will be continued and will be extended to other new places after purchasing some medium size jet planes. (f) Purchase of some STOL planes and start regular STOL air service to hilly and Himalayan regions like Lamidanda, Rumjatar, Lukla, Namchhe bazar, Doti, Jumla, Surkhet, Saphebazar (Achham), Jiri, Baglung and such other places. (g) At present, there is only one workshop for DC-3 plane. Also, spare parts required for the above mentioned planes will be purchased. An agreement on a loan between His Majesty’s Government and the Asian Development Bank has been reached. Financial Outlay: The Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation will invest Rs 123 million to execute the above programme during the Fourth Plan period. The total outlay will be spent as follows: All the above mentioned programmes for the development of air transportation are related to each other. Therefore, the programmes of both the Department of Civil Aviation and the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation need to be implemented in order to achieve the target of the Plan. It is evident that if the target of one were to remain unfulfilled, it would be difficult to meet the target of other. Though the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation is an autonomous organization, His Majesty’s Government has given due consideration to its importance and has given it necessary protection and aid many times. The tradition will be continued during this Plan period as well. Although only Rs 100 million will be spent by His Majesty’s Government during the Plan period, the willingness shown by His Majesty’s Government in making additional amounts available to the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation and to the provision of assistance and facilities of other kinds have proven to be great support and will remain so in the future. CHAPTER XII TELECOMMUNICATION Telecommunication service was first started in Nepal in the year 1913. Telephone lines, extending for a length of 518 Km. between Kathmandu and Dhankuta were installed in the year 1936. In addition, a 240 Km. telephone line was installed linking Palpa and Kathmandu in 1951. Similarly, 25 automatic telephone lines were also installed in Kathmandu in the year 1935. Another chapter in the development of telecommunication service in Nepal extends from 1951 to 1956. An additional, telephone line was established in 1953 linking Palpa with Bhairahawa. In the same manner, a 29 Km. long telephone line was installed from Kathmandu to Dhulikhel. A Central Battery (C.B. Further extension of telephone lines to a capacity of 300 was completed in 1957. Wirelessservice in Nepal was started in 1950. At that time, the service was limited to Kathmandu, Bhairahawa, Illam, Dhankuta and Biratnagar. This service was further extended to Doti, Dang, Jumla, Dailekh, Sallyan, Okhaldhunga and Rajbiraj in the year 1952 and to Jaleshwar, Ramechhap, Bandipur, Terathum, Taplejung, Dandeldhura and Baitadi at a later date. Three more such stations were set-up in Baglung, Palpa and Dhangadi in the same year. Similarly, new stations were added in Pokhara, Bhojpur and Birgunj. Formerly, telecommunication services were under the Department of Communications, which also had the responsibility of looking after the postal services of the country. The national development of telecommunication services in a planned, coordinated, and controlled way was started after 1959 when the Department of Telecommunication was established. 1. With the implementation of the First Plan, new turns in the development of telecommunication service had taken place, not only to meet the needs of administration and security but also to develop different facilities for education, industry, trade and the general public. 1. With the implementation of the First Plan, new turns in the development of telecommunication service had taken place, not only to meet the needs of administration and security but also to develop different facilities for education, industry, trade and the general public. Accordingly, an automatic telephone exchange system with a capacity of 3,000 lines was installed in Kathmandu. 2. In the Second Plan period, the construction of different wireless stations started in the First Plan was completed, replacing the 28 existing stations which were out of order by that time. In addition, 50 satellite stations in different districts and 7 area control stations in Kathmandu, Jaleswor, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Bhairahawa, Nepaljung and Dhangadi were also installed. Also, two teleprinters were installed to excahange message quickly as possible. In the field of telephone services, a telephone exchange was established in Bhaktapur. In Kathmandu, 12 local centers were set up for the use of the general public. The establishment of telecommunication stations between India and Nepal was also completed. Within this period, major work regarding the establishment of telecommunication service between Nepal and Pakistan was also completed. 3. In the Third Plan period, since the existing exchange of 100 lines telephone service proved very insufficient in meeting the demand, an additional 4,000 lines in Kathmandu city and 600 lines in Lalitpur (Patan) were installed. In Biratnagar, the total capacity of the telephone lines was increased to 400 with the installation of an additional 100 lines. By the fourth year of the Plan, wireless stations have been installed in five more districts. By the end of the Third Plan, wireless services have been made available in about all of the 14 zones and 75 districts. The annual achievements of the Plan accordance with the targets are given below: Programmes and Targets of the Fourth Plan In accordance with the above objectives the following projects are included. 5.1 Kathmandu Teleprinter: The teleprinter service became necessary with increase in te volume of trade,the development of tourism, increase in the air service, and hotel accommodation. Compared to wireless services, the following are the additional facilities that are made available by teleprinter services: (1) The exchange of more time during conversation, (2) Conversation which takes place remain in the printed form, (3) Communication of messages is possible in the absence of the other party, (4) Conversations which take place remain secret The cost of establishing, maintaining, and repairing the Telex system is higher than the wireless system. However, this system is used mostly by individuals or institutions connected with trade and industry, and the service is highly beneficial to such individuals or institutions. In Kathmandu, an International Telex System with 100 lines capacity (which can be increased to 300 if necessary) will be established to cater to the increasing needs for trade, hotel services, tourism, industry etc. This form of communication service will help to directly increase the revenue of His Majesty\\'s Government by helping in the extension of trade and industry. 5.2 Tele-Communication Training Centre In Nepal, Tele -communication services has been expanding at an increasing rate in the last eight years. The local exchange lines have increased from 300 lines to 5,400 lines, and the number of wireless stations has gone up from 26 to 70. International services have been established as well. The telecommunication services will definitely be expanding at an increasing pace in the future. Therefore, it is obvious that many trained people are needed to implement new projects and to continue the services smoothly. At present, the number of trained people is very limited, compared to the expansion of this service. Naturally it is not possible to implement any new projects effectively or to run the existing services effectively. At present there is no institute to provide training or study courses in the field of telecommunication, nor is here any programme to establish one in the future. The problem is to establish a training center in accordance with the needs of the Department. Training facilities will be provided in different fields according to needs. The duration of the t raining course will be two to three years. Training will be provided to thirty persons annually. Necessary funds, in the form of assistance, will be made available for this purpose from the United Nations Special Fund. This will include the service of technical experts and equipments. The local expenses, on the other hand, will be borne by His Majesty\\'s Government. Arrangements for training regarding telephone services will be made as a part of the present engineering Institute. This will reduce the administrative expenses of setting up a separate training center and will enable the Institute to run at full capacity. 5.3 Bhairahawa-Gorakhpur and Lucknow-Nepalgunj wireless service: Except Tribikot Wireless services have been established in all districts of Nepal. This has put an excessive pressure upon Kathmandu and it has not been possible to make International Telecommunication service as prompt as in other countries. Because of rising demand, the problem will become more acute. The only solution is to make international telecommunication services available in the Eastern and Western parts of the country through the construction of an East-West microwave system. At present, there should be direct linkage between Biratnagar and Calcutta in the East and Nepalgunj and Lucknow in the West. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to conclude necessary arrangements between Nepal and India, and necessary arrangements should be made for the construction and the establishment of telecommunication offices at Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj. With the completion of the project, it would be very convenient to quickly exchange conversation and promptly deliver messages. It would also help to generate excess revenue to the Government. Naturally, it will help the Government in its efforts to increase revenue. 5.4 Local Telephone Exchange: In accordance with the need to establish telephone exchange projects in different zones and districts in order to meet the need of increasing trade and transaction and expanding industrialization, it has been planned to install local telephone exchange at 13 places: Kathmandu, Lalitpur (Patan), Bhaktapur, Hetauda, Bhairahawa, Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Dharan, Biratnagar, Jhapa, Pokhara, Malangawa, and Nepalgunj. Out of this, there is a programme to install three exchange projects within Kathmandu Valley, one in the inner Terai, six in the Eastern Terai, two in the Western Terai, and one in the hilly region. 5,600 telephone lines (including 600 in Patan) have been installed by the end of the Third Plan. However, it became necessary to install 5,300 additional telephone lines within a decade. The main reason behind this is the increasing volume of trade and transactions, the activity in social and other sectors, andin the administrative matter of being the capital of the country. In view of growing number of transactions aand the increasing demand for telephone lines, 5,000 additional automatic telephone lines will be installed in the Plan period. It will help in the expansion of trade and industry and indirectly increasing Government revenue. It will also provide a facility of the modern era to the general public. Lalitpur (Patan) Because Lalitpur is one of the three main cities of the Kathmandu Valley, the 600 telephone lines installed at present are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand. Therefore, 400 additional lines will be installed in the Plan period. Bhaktapur: Bhaktapur, is one of the other important cities of Kathmandu Valley and is located 13 kilometres away from the city of Kathmandu. In spite of its importance as a commercial city, it has not yet been provided with telephone facilities. Therefore, telephone lines will be distributed after the installation of one telephone exchange with the capacity of 200 lines. Hetauda: Hetauda is one of the main industrial centers of Narayani Zone. It has been felt that local telephone and trunk telephone lien facilities should be made available at this town if possible. A capacity of 50 lines telephone exchange will be installed during the Plan period on the basis of population, industry and commercial development. Janakpur: Because of a growing population, an increasing number of trade, transactions, and industrial development in the area, it has become necessary to establish a telephone exchange project. As the proposed micro wave system will through Janakpur, a telephone exchange project with the capacity of 200 lines will be installed during this Plan period Rajbiraj: Rajbiraj is also one of the centers through which the proposed East-West microwave system passes, therefore, it has become necessary to install a telephone exchange with respect to population and the volume of trade in this region. It is , therefore, planned to establish a manual telephone exchange station with the capacity of one hundred lines. Dharan: Dharan has its own importance from the point of view of its trade, social and industrial development. As such, it is necessary to install 400 lines to meet the existing demand. Thus, an automatic telephone exchange project with a capacity to supply 1,000 lines in the future will be installed during the Plan period. Biratnagar: Although a C.B. telephone exchange with a capacity of 400 lines has already been installed, the present capacity has not been sufficient to meet the growing demand caused by the increasing population, trade and industries in this city. Therefore, an automatic telephone exchange with the capacity to distribute up to 5,000 lines, as required, will be installed in the near future. At the initial stage, it will supply 2500 lines only. Jhapa: Taking into account the volume of trade and industrial expansion, it can be considered to be one of the important centers of the country. In addition, as the East-West Microwave will pass through the city, it is necessary to establish telephone exchange station. A telephone exchange with a capacity of 100 telephone lines will be established during the Plan period. 5.6 Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Carrier Service: Considering the growing population and the increasing trade of Bhaktapur city, another of the important centers in Kathmandu Valley, it is now necessary to join the Bhaktapur exchange with that of Kathmandu. Therefore, a necessary trunk line will be installed to link Bhaktapur telephone exchange project with Kathmandu. This will help increase the Government revenue. 5.7 East-West Microwave: Since the existing telecommunication line has proven insufficient to meet increasing demand, it has been deemed necessary to install a modern trunk telephone line. Accordingly, this project is formulated to install a micro wave system which will help to link important centers within the country and also make it possible to establish direct contact with outside world. Its speciality is the establishment of a system which makes quick delivery of messages and conversations between different parties simultaneously without any wire connections. With the installation of this project, as in the case of trunk telephone lines, it will help to overcome the deficiencies of the present wireless system in which conversation is possible only between two persons. It will have 120 channels initially, although necessary equipment will be installed to enable its capacities to be increased to 600 channels. In the Fourth Plan, a microwave system will be installed in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Biratnagar, Dharan, Jhapa, Pokhara and Ghairahawa. The installation of a high level microwave system will help to increase the flow of communication and also to increase Government revenue directly. In the coming five year period, a 100 per cent increase in revenue from the communication service is expected. 5.8 Kathmandu-Raxual Trunk Telephone System and Birgunj Telephone Exchange: The target is to establish a trunk telephone line between Kathmandu and Raxual and to install 1,000 automatic telephone lines in Birgunj. It is estimated that the total outlay required for the implementation of the above projects will be Rs 36.75 million. Although allocations for the telecommunication sector have increased by 63 per cent, there has been only a 39 per cent increase in actual expenditures as shown in the above table. However, if the expenditures incurred in the Kathmandu-Calcutta Telex project are also included, the total expenditure would be in much closer accord with the budget. In the Fourth Plan Rs 367.5 million will be spent in the different projects shown in the following Table: CHAPTER XIII POSTAL DEVELOPMENT Role of Postal Service in the development of the country: There has been a considerable increase in the number of educated and literate persons in modern Nepal. The importance and necessity of the postal services has been increased because of a larger number of persons going outside the country for the purpose of traveling or for earning a living an increase I the internal and external trade of the country, as well as several other reasons. It has occupied an indispensable place in the society by providing an easily available and cheep service to the general public. In a country like Nepal, with an undeveloped system of transportation and a rugged topography, the postal service is the most easily available and extensive method of contact at Governmental, institutional, family, and person to person levels. In addition, the postal service is the only means of establishing contact in most parts of the country. Furthermore, this sate of affairs is likely to continue for a few more decades. Since the availability of a postal service constitutes an integral part of the necessary development infrastructures, the postal service programme must be implemented as vigorously as in the previous Plan period. Historical Review: Historically speaking, regular postal services in the country seem to have originated from the system established by Prithvi Narayan Shah to exchange news which was essential to the process of national unification. There was no big problem of internal communication between small principalities and states into which Nepal was then divided. On the other hand, a regular system for the exchange of letters and news from one place of the country to the other became necessary for administrative and national security reasons after unification made the country larger. Although the postal service was originally established to meet the requirements of administration and national security, it has now developed into a large -scale nationa l system for the service of the people, as well. It has become essential and indispensable for public service. Historically, the origin of the present post office dates back to the year 1878. The first postage stamps of 1,2 and 4 annas were issued after the establishment of the General Post Office in 1881. After six years, post card were introduced in 1887. In 1913, postmen were paid to carry mail all over the country, except for the district of Jumla. In 1900, (Bairung service), and in 1933, money order services were introduced on an experimental basis. But these services could not continue for long. Although postage stamps of different denominations had been issued, there were not, however, for a long period recognized in the outside world. In order to get recognition of Nepalese postage by neighbouring counties a Nepal-India bilateral agreement was signed in 1936 with regard t correspondence and unregistered mail. Post exchange offices were established in eight different border areas of the two countries. This was, undoubtedly, an important step for Nepal in the development of an international postal system. Two more important steps in the modernization of the postal administration were taken with the establishment of sub-inspector’s office in 1935 and seven postal circle offices in 1940. After the revolution of 1950, the postal services were further expanded. Nepal obtained membership in the World Postal Union in 1956, and about two years later, eight additional exchange offices were established in the southern border areas. Changes were also made in the precious bilateral agreements with India. Since April 1959, Nepal’s international postal services have widened as a member of World Postal Union. With the aim of increasing the sale of Nepalese stamps in the national and international philatelic markets, the Nepal Philatelic Bureau was established in 1962. Internal airmail was introduced in 1958 and external air mail in 1959. Instead of the former Postal Circles, Postal Control Offices were organized in seven zones in 1960 in order to make postal administration more efficient and scientific. The pace of development in the field of postal services has been faster since 1960. The Postal Training Centre was set-up during the Second Plan in 1962. in the same month, mail service was carried with the help of the third organization (party) and the Indian railways in order to speed up internal service. The interna l insurance service was started in 1962. The interna l insurance service was started in 1962. Postal legislation confirming to international regulations and the modern age was passed in April 1962. Bairung service was resources- started throughout the Kingdom in April 1963. in accordance with the Nepal-India agreement, international insurance mail and parcel service were started in April 1965. Consequently, the Indian Embassy Post Office which had functioned for the last 150 years was closed down, and the Kathmandu Foreign Post Office was established. Since it was necessary to set-up a Central Office for carrying the mails to the proper destinations and for the timely sorting of mail coming from surface or air routes, the mail center was established on September 1965. The Postal Inspection Office was setup in 1966 in order to prevent postal crimes and to settle any case which arises. With the aim of providing a facility to consumers for easy monetary transaction in small amounts, the Postal Order Service was started in April 1966. A Dead Letter Centre was established in 1968 in order to investigate undelivered mail, to find the proper address, and to deliver it. Expansion of Postal Services There were 43 postal offices in the country in the year 1883. After 7 decades, this number had increased to 124 by the beginning of the First Plan period. During this First Plan, 293 additional postal offices were set-up. Four offices were added in the interim period between the First and Second Plans. The number of postal offices during the Second and Third Plan period was further increased by 30 and 255, respectively. Up-to-date of Postal Development The cumulative number of post offices at the end of the Third Plan and before the beginning of the Fourth Plan is as follows: With the exception of 20 administrative offices, there are 706 regional (area) offices providing services for the public use. The total population of the country before the beginning of the Fourth Plan has been estimated to be 11,44,000 over an area of 54,362 square miles. Accordingly, each postal office is serving a population of 15,643 and in area of 77 square miles, Objectives and Policies in the Fourth Plan The following objectives and policies have been adopted in the Fourth Plan: (a) to carry out this plan as the first phase of long-term twenty year plan; (b) to give due priority to the opening of additional post offices in the expansion of postal services; (c) to take necessary steps in order to make the postal services financially self-sufficient; (d) to emphasize the construction of postal buildings; (e) to develop the postal-services within a group, making it efficient and capable, although it is included in the general administrative service. In the Fourth Plan, the policy has been adopted to expand the postal services at the rate of 10 additional postal offices for each government postal office. Thus in the Fourth Plan, the target has been set up to establish 5 sub-posts, 50 branch posts and 550 additional post offices. Similarly, 25 postal lines will be expanded at the average rate of 5 per year. In short, the kind and numbers of the projects to be undertaken during the Plan period are as follows: 1. Sub post: This is the same as the ratio between the government and additional post. But in some strategic areas it has become essential to setup sub-post offices and to upgrade some of the branch offices because of growing responsibility during the Plan period. Keeping in view all these pros and cons, about 20 sub- post offices are urgently needed. It has been envisaged to set-up 5 sub-posts during the Plan period (or one per year) and to expand them more economically as soon as possible. 2. Branch posts: But in accordance with the policy of establishing the less expensive post, during the Fourth Plan, only 50 post offices will be established. 3. Additional post: Because of the above mentioned reasons, about 550 additional post offices will be established during this Plan period. According to estimates, one post office is supposed to serve for a population of 3,000 to 5,000. Therefore, the number of posts should be increased considerably, keeping in view the pattern of scattered settlement and the rugged topography of the country. Thus in this Plan period efforts will be made to set up 550 posts. After completion of three projects dealing with the extension of postal services mentioned above, the total number of postal offices will be 1,331. The population of Nepal during the Fourth Plan has been projected to reach 12 million. The area of Nepal is 54,362 square miles, each postal office will serve on the average, an area of 41.5 square miles and a population of 9,153. 4. Postal line: In a country like Nepal with a decentralized administrative system at the local level, the exchange of letters within and between the units via a speedy and direct route of communication is essential for development programmes and administration. Thus in the Fourth Plan, 25 additional postal lines will be set up in order to set the distance of postal routes. 5. Mail services: Some portions of the Mahendra Highway, the Prithvi Highway, the Siddartha Highway and the Zonal & district roads are nearing completion. They will be serviceable for all weather , therefore, mail service in 10 divisions will be carried out on a contract basis. Similarly, in the remote and inaccessible area, new STOL air-fields are being constructed and made serviceable. This will mean that air mail will be made available in 6 divisions. 6. Commodity Store: The necessary resources will be made available to acquire papers, stamps, mailing bags, weights and other measures and counter machines etc., which are essential for carrying out the administration of the postal-services. 7. Regional Office of the commodity supply: The Central Commodity Store, which has to act as a Super Commodity Store in supplying the needed materials for several offices scattered in 75 districts of the country and inside the country and then in storing them for later distribution throughout the country. 8. Commodity Workshop: The necessity of being self sufficient in such technical goods such as stamps and letter boxes has been recognized, and therefore, a Commodity Centre will be set up in a miniature form, having only limited production capacity. This will be operated on an experimental basis. 9. Building Construction: The lack of Government buildings for postal services is one of the major bottlenecks. Also the available buildings often cannot fulfill the requirements of the area. This has been creating a problem in the efficiency and skill of administration. About 80 per cent of the postal buildings are now rented. Therefore, in this Plan period, greater emphasis will be given to the construction of new postal buildings. Under the building construction programme, about 30 postal buildings will be completed in the following districts: 10. Philatelic Development: During the Third Plan, foreign currency worth approximately 300,000 was earned by making Nepalese postage stamps available in the national and international philatelic market. This will be achieved through the publication of attractive stamps, wide advertisement and publicity, along with the necessary folders, booklets and a complete inventory of the postal ticket collection list. All of these will add to the national income. During the third or fourth year of this Plan, two small area offices, one in the east and other in the west, will be opened to provide services to postage stamp collectors from outside and inside the country. Moreover, a sales organization in the philatelic center of the United Nations will be made through a bilateral agreement with the United Nations. 11. Training Development Programme: In view of increased demand for trained personnel in the postal services during the Fourth Plan period, efforts will be made to make the present training system more productive both qualitatively and quantitatively. The following work will be included under training: 1. To publish the cirriculum 2. To arranger hostel facilities for 50 trainees. 3. To modernize the postal training Center, providing audiovisual equipment and other needed materials for training. 4. To set up a postal library. 5. To arrange the specially trained and other needed staff for training . 12. Regional Dead Letter Office: In the Third Plan, a Dead Letter Office unit was established on a small-scale. However, this has proved to be failure since it has had to deal with letters from all of Nepal. Therefore, during the Fourth Plan, it has been envisaged to set up two dead letter offices, one in Biratnagar in the east and one in Bhairahawa in the west. 13. Postal Museum: During this Plan period, one small postal museum will be set up to preserve the valuable, rare, ancient, and historically important documents such as inscription stamps, tools and other related materials. 14. Service extension and Improvement: order to extend postal services for the public, the following programme will be\\tIn implemented: 1. To organize and conduct the internal insurance letter programme which was started in previous years and to make it more widely used as soon as possible. 2. To improve and give wide recognition to the postal order services which proved to be successful in the Third Plan. 3. To modernize the internal parcel services and bring it up to international standards. 4. To set up the postal savings banks if proved feasible by experimentation at a selected post office. 15. International Services: In the Fourth Plan, the following agreements will be signed and services implemented: 1. Entering into two extensive multilateral agreements regarding international insurance letters and parcel services formulated under the sponsorship of U.P.O. and to make such agreements (which had been only bilateral in the preceeding plan period) complete and extensive. 2. To operate postal order Services with India. 3. To establish three exchange postal offices in the three northern or southern border centers for international posta l exchange. 4. To operate money order services on the basis of a bilateral agreement with India. 16. Mobile Inspection Team: Financial Outlay: In the Fourth Plan, about Rs 244.51 million will be spent for the improvement and expansion of the postal services. CHAPTER XIV NEPAL ENGINEERING INSTITUTE The experiences of Nepal and other developing countries have been shown that the shortage of technical manpower (both skilled and semi-skilled) has been one of the main problems encountered in the implementation of development projects. As a large portion of total investment in the process of planned development is allocated for construction work, the demand for technicians, trained in their respective fields, will continue to increase. Not only has there been a shortage of technicians capable workers in the construction work. Because of the unavailability of suitable of workers, many projects have remained behind schedule. It is thus essential that the necessary steps be taken to augment the number of technicians and labourers, so that construction will runway more smoothly. Arrangements have been made to provide overseer-level technician training in civil Engineering at the Institute ever since it was set up. At the beginning of the Fourth Plan, 321 trained persons have already been made available from the Institute. In addition, the construction of a laboratory building and a student hostel have also been completed. Effective steps have also been taken to make the Institute well-equipped by providing the required shades and equipment for different workshops. volume of development projects undertaken in the country has been increasing. The Accordingly, more technicians and skilled workers are needed. Training will, therefore, be provided to overseers in the fields of electrical engineering, telecommunication and civil aviation, as well as civil engineering. The duration of the training will be three years. In addition, an educational programme for wood working and electricity will be formulated, and skilled workers of different levels will be trained. In addition to this, the old trainees will also be provided refresher courses and special training in order to acquaint them with modern equipments in accordance with this, the Institute will train the following personnel in different trades during the Fourth Plan. As the demand for technicians and skilled workers will be partially met, it is hoped that it will be helpful in the implementation of development projects such as the construction of roads, buildings, irrigation facilities, etc. In order to expand the training available, machinery, a concrete laboratory, a soil-testing laboratory, and hydraulic laboratory will be setup in the Institution during the Plan period. CHAPTER XIX GEOLOGICAL SURVEY & MINING Agriculture, forest and mineral resources are the raw materials essential for the industrial development of the country. Of these three natural resources, investment, time, technical knowledge, and experience are required to a great extent in the development of mineral resources. Instances in several countries have been observed when a major contribution to the economy has been through mineral resources which were able to earn large amounts of money. The important reasons responsible for the lack of proper development of mineral resources in Nepal have been the very small and unplanned amount of investment made in this sector, and the lack of small and unplanned amount of investment made in this sector, and the lack of expert technical manpower, and the capacity to use modern equipments in mineral exploration. The proper development of mineral resources of the country would help the industrialization and in the earning foreign exchange could be increased by exporting it as raw material to abroad. Progress to date Although mineral exploration in Nepal was started during the Rana regime, it was not until the beginning of the First Five Year Plan period that it was done in a planned manner. However, no remarkable progress has yet been made in this field. In addition, after a study of the grade and quantity of the deposits, all necessary arrangements were to be made so that the excavation of minerals could be started. The expenditure of the First Plan period amounted to Rs 1.9 million. Among its achievements was the discovery of mineral deposits ‘worthy of being developed’, including iron ore deposits of Phulchoki, Labdi and those copper deposits at Wasa and Arkhaula, and gold on the banks of the Ridi river, and slate deposits at Bandipur. Also deposits of nickel, cobalt, graphite, gypsum, salt, beryl and petroleum were discovered. The construction of the building of the Bureau of Mines at Lainchaur was almost comleted during this period. No progress worth mentioning was made regarding the ‘starting in the near future of exploitation of deposits which have already been discovered’ or even of the ‘making of all necessary arrangements before starting exploitation’ as was envisaged in the First Plan. During the Second Plan, the development of mineral resources was included with the survey of other natural resources, such as forest, soil and hydropower. The target of Second Plan was not as ambitious as that the First Plan with regard to mineral development. It was planned to undertake a detailed survey of different mineral resources, including pre-investment surveys of the more promising ones,and the establishment of a minerals laboratory. Under ‘detailed survey’, copper deposits at Kulekhani, Nangre Bhorle, Samar Bhamar, Neta, Darling and Tamghas; cobalt and nickel deposits at Arkhule; gas, lignite and groundwater in the Kathmandu Valley; marble deposits at Godavari and placer gold on the Banks of Kali Gandaki were to be examined. On the other hand, iron deposits at Phulchoki, Labdi and Those; copper deposits at Baglung, and mica deposits at East No.1 and West No. A sum of Rs 1.3 million was spent for the development of mineral resources during the Second Plan period. The achievements of this Plan period were the completion of construction of the building and laboratory of the Bureau of Mines at Lainchaur, the investigation for petroleum in Dailekh and Surkhet districts, the geological survey of 1,000 square miles, the completion of a preliminary survey of mica deposits at East No.1 and East No.2 districts, and the discovery of new mineral deposits at several different places. A geological survey was to be given top priority during this period. This survey was to be undertaken in search of the basic minerals essential for industrial development. Among its targets were a pre- investment survey of Phulchoki iron ore deposits; a detailed survey of copper deposits at Bandipur, Illam and East No. 1 and preliminary work in the commercial exploration of the most profitable copper deposits; an investigation for gold on the banks of Kali Gandaki and Rapti rivers; a detailed survey of mica deposits at East No. Until the second year of the Third Plan, work regarding geological surveys and mines was being undertaken by the Bureau of Mines. It was, however, decided to set up a separate Geological Survey Department, thereby making the two departments responsible for the development of mineral resources. Placer gold in Marsyangadi and Seti rivers, brine at Lamjung, pegmatite and mica at Lamjung and semi-precious stones in Sankhuwasabha district were also investigated. In the same way, preliminary studies were made concerning the possible production of dead burnt Magnesite and fused magnesium phosphate from the Kharidhunga magnestic deposits, glass from Karrakhola sand deposit, and sulphur and sulphuric acid from the pyrite deposits at Bering Khola. Because the first cement factory to be sent up in the country was to utilize limestone deposit from Chobar, detailed investigation work on the Bhainse limestone deposit was discontinued. Since the Magnesite deposit of Kampughat turned out to be a low grade one, the detailed survey of magnesitedeposit of Kharidhunga has been continued and will be completed by the first year of the Fourth Plan period. A detailed investigation of lead and zinc deposits of Ganesh Himal is being conducted by a private foreign company under the Nepal Mines Act. The Geological Survey Department did regional mapping of 8,550 sq. miles of different zones including Maha kali, Seti, Gandaki and Lumbini as well as reconnaissance mapping of 3,000 sq. miles. During the preceeding three plan periods, more attention was devoted to attempts to discover new mineral deposit in different areas of the country, rather than to detailed planned investigation of deposits already discovered in different geographic regions of the country. Consequently, it was not possible to get detailed results on most of the deposits. It could be said that no detailed investigation and evaluation of mineral deposit could be undertaken because of lack of trained manpower, unequipped laboratory facilities, and a program which was inconsistent with the targets. Similarly, the geological survey was done in a scattered and unplanned way, sometimes resulting in duplication and sometimes in no work at all being done. Fourth Plan The objectives of the geological survey are the preparation of geological maps, the systematic exploration and investigation of the mineral resources of the country and the publication of geological data after their collection. In accordance with the implementation policy of the Fourth Plan period, priority will be given to areas found to be most feasible on the basis of previous studies. Intensive investigation will be limited\\tto those areas which have been given top priority. The operational objectives regarding mineral are to conduct the necessary investigation and analysis of mineral resources of Nepal after a thorough study is done with respect to grade and quantity, to make feasibility studies of mineral industries, to cooperate in the working of such industries and to increase the national income by the development of such industries. In order to implement these operational objectives of the Fourth Plan, preliminary investigation will be conducted on sites found to be feasible by the Geological Survey. The foreign technical assistance essential for the implementation of projects will be secured. In addition, modern equipments will be imported in order to adopt new techniques in geological survey and mineral investigations and to expand the laoboratory. It is hloped that increased investment and efforts in the development of mineral resources during the Fourth Plan period will result in some concrete achievements which will be helpful in the initialization and development of the country. It has also become essential to coordinate to the maximum possible extent the programmes and operations of the two departments involved (i.e. Geolo gical Survey and Survey, and the detailed Geological-Mineral Survey under integrated Geo-effective. Although the Geological Survey will be primarily responsible Fourth Plan this, the cooperation of the Bureau of Mines will also be sought. A. \\tGeological Survey: Nepalgunj, exploratory drilling will be done as well as geophysical, magnetic and seismic studies. 1. Western Te rai (Koilabas-Nepalgunj) Petroleum Investigation: In the context of investigation for petroleum in the Western Terai area between Koilabas and This view is also shared by United Nations specialists who have visited Nepal. Preference will, therefore, be given to drilling in this area. If petroleum were discovered the surplus production could be exported to foreign countries. This could thus make a heavy impact upon the national economy. Rs 24 million will be spent for this purpose during the Plan period. 2. Arrangement of Preliminary Investigation for Petroleum in Western Terai (Nepalgunj-Dhangadhi): According to the specialists, the area between Nepalgunj and Dhangadhi is worth investigating, although there is less likelihood of discovering petroleum in this area than between Koilabas and Nepalgunj. With regard to progress made in the search for petroleum in the Koilabas-Nepalgunj area, preliminary work will be done on this project. 3. Gas Investment in Kathmandu Valley: The fuel problem in Kathmandu Valley could be partially solved if a gas reservoir could be located. Even at the present time, limited amounts of gas are being utilized as fuel. The equipment made available for this programme could be utilized for other projects as well. A geophysical survey and exploratory drilling will be conducted for this purpose. 4. Phosphate Exploration: Exploration for phosphate rocks will be done in Lumbini, Seti and Mahakali zones. The discovery of phosphate rocks could be helpful in the development of agriculture, as it is utilized in the manufacture of fertilizers. 5. Regional Mapping: Under this project, detailed surface geological surveys of different places Rapti, Bheri, Karnali and Dhaulagiri zones will be conducted. Since it deals with the preparation Fourth Plan a detailed geological map of the country, it could be considered to be a ‘basic’ for the development of mineral resources. 6. Reconnaissance Mapping: Under this project, ‘through Scale’ geological mapping will be done in different places in Sagarmatha, Kosi, Mahakali and Seti zones. Surveying of this kind will provide a base for detailed geological mapping at a later time. 7. Other Detailed Geological Survey: Phosphate at Dharan) will be further investigated in detail in order to utilize them as soon as possible. 8. Research and Preparation of Reports: Various equipments necessary Fourth Plan ruse in the laboratory will be made available under this project. In order to increase the utility of data and samples collected in the field in the context of geological survey works, it is necessary to study them in detail in the laboratory equipped with modern equipments is a ‘must’ for the successful implementation of any geological survey. B. Integrated Geological-Mineral Survey: 1. Aeromagnetic Survey of Nepal An aeromagnetic survey of about 128,000 sq. km. (50,000 sq. miles) of territory in different parts of Nepal will be conducted on contract. Detection of mineral deposits from the surface level alone is often time consuming and neither systematic nor practical. On the basis of such anomalies it is easy to conduct surface exploration in a systematic manner and to give priorities to different areas for further work. Such detailed mineral exploration and investigations will be conducted at some selected localities. After the preparation of an aeromagnetic map Fourth Plan the country, foreign mining companies might be expected to conduct detailed exploration of mineral resources in different parts of the country. 2. Detailed Geological-Mineral Exploration of Deposits in Western Nepal: Under this programme, 25,000 sq. km. of territory in Gandaki, Dhaulagiri and Lumbini zones will be studied in detail by integrating geological-physical and geochemical methods. As the well-known old copper deposits of Baglung, Okharbot and vicinity are located in this area, it will be easier, to study the density of deposits, including those deep beneath the earth. 3. Prelimanary Work on Detailed Geological-Mineral Exploration of Deposits in Eastern Nepal: This is similar to the project envisaged for Western Nepal. Under this Project, preliminary work on the investigation of mineral resources will be conducted by integrating geological, geophysical and geological-chemical methods. C. Projects Regarding Detailed Investigation of Mineral Deposits and Feasibility Studies 1.Detailed Investigation of Kharidhunga (Sindhualchok District) Magnesite Deposit: Itwas estimated after the initial phase of detailed exploration, that 1,000 million tons of Magnesite ore (both low and high grade) were present in the deposit. The work of proving 10 million tons of high- grade ore had mostly been completed during the first year of the Fourth Plan period. Dead burnt Magnesite to be used for the export and for F.N.P. fertilizers for the home consumption can be produced from high grade Magnesite. 2. Detailed Exploration of Copper Deposits of Bhutkhola (Tanahu District) and Gyaji (Gorkha District): In the first stage, both deposits will undergo detailed exploration by an application of geological, geophysical and geochemical methods. The deposit found to be most feasible on the basis of the initial exploration will be further investigated, and the grade and quantity of ore will be estimated. 3. Detailed Exploration of Chemical Grade Limestone (Mahabharat Range) The occurance of chemical grade limestone will be explored in the limestone quarries of Mahabharat Range, and grade and quantity of the deposit discovered will be estimated. Chemical grade limestone manufacture of glass, calcium cyanide (hetrogenous fertilizer ), and in the production of sugar. 4. Exploration of Pegmatite in Northern Nepal: Pegmatite found in different localities in Northern Nepal will be investigated in detail under this project. Until now, the investigation of pegmatite had been not carried systematically and has been done solely to obtain mica. The proposed project will explore pegmatite, especially in view of the possibility of discovering several other metallic and non-metallic mineral generally associated with pegmatite. It is essential to utilize the services of foreign specialists in the project because of their knowledge and experience. 5. Detailed Exploration of Copper Deposits of Wapsa Khani (Solukhumbu District) and Siddhi Khani (Illam District): After a review of studies made already by Geological Survey, a detailed exploration will be done on these deposit by applying geological, geophysical and geochemical methods. 6. Detailed Investigation of Cement Grade Limestone at Bhainse Dhobhan (Makawanpur District): It has been estimated that there are 8.9 million tons of ‘proved’ and ‘semi -proved’ cement grade limestone at Bhainse Dhoban in Makawanpur district. After it was decided to establish the first cement factory in Nepal (annual capacity 60,000 tons) at Chobhar in Kathmandu Valley, investigation at this site was postponed. As it is estimated that the annual cement requirement of Nepal will be 60,000 tons by the year 1975-75, it will be necessary to set up an additional cement factory in Nepal. In order to meet this prospective demand, a detailed investigation will be undertaken to prove at least 10 million tons of cement grade limestone at Bhainse, and also to make the necessary soil survey. 8. Exploration of Miscellaneous Deposits: Under this project, detailed investigation of deposits already discovered (such as copper from Baglung, Okharbot and Rukumkot) and of other metallic and non-metallic deposits which might be discovered later and which are found to be promising on the basis of preliminary investigation will be further explored. 9. Field Equipment and Machinery: Equipment necessary for the field work, i.e. heavy and light drill machine (with auxilaries), hand-drill, compressors, trucks, jeeps, survey and geophysical equipment , and camping equipment, will be made available under this project. As it is not possible to conduct any detailed mineral exploration effectively without this equipment and machinery, this project is an important and unseparable part of the detailed exploration programmes of mineral resources. 10. Laboratory and research: This kind of ‘service product’ which includes setting up reinforcing or expanding chemical, mineral, ore dressing, and physical testing laboratories; drafting , duplicating and photo services; repair shops, and a mineral museum and library. As no work dealing with the development of mineral resources could be implemented successfully without well equipped laboratories and research facilities, this is an essential and important project. 11. Feasibility Study of Mineral Based Industries: (a) \\tFeasibility study of those industries based upon the Magnesite deposit of Karidhunga and the cement industry based upon the limestone deposit of Bhainse. (b) \\tReviews of the iron and steel industry based upon the iron ore deposits of Phulchoki, the glass industry based upon Karrakhola deposits in Hetauda, the utilization of pyrite deposits at Bering Khola and the nitrogeneous fertilizer industry. (c) \\tFeasibility studies of paint, building stone, marble, concrete products, lime (small scale), ceramic, pesticide and fertilizer blading industries. As soon as proper technical and economic justification is established by the Department on the basis of preliminary study in the first stage, the services of qualified and experienced foreign consultants will be made available fro a detailed feasibility study. 12. Technical Assistance to Industries in Private Sector: Under this project, technical advice will be made available to small scale mining industries in the private sector. There have as reductions in production, damage to roads and forests and danger to accidents in the private sector mining industry because of a lack of expert technical advice in Nepal. CHAPTER XV Industrial development is essential in order to increase production and per capita income at a rate fast enough to provide a basis for the economic development of the country; to decrease the population’s dependence on the agricultural sector; to provide profitable employment for the increasing number of educated persons in the community; and to better utilize the resources of the country. On one hand, it could be said that industrial development of the maximum possible extent is necessary to increase the pace of development of the country; on the other hand, the infrastructure required for industrial development is not entirely present in Nepal. The need of raw materials for healthy industrial development of the country has been acknowledged, but no substantial deposit of those ray materials essential for the mineral industry have yet been discovered. The industrial feasibility study of forest resources in the country has been started only recently, and it has not yet been possible to fulfill the demand of agro-based industries. The market for any large scale industrial development is also lacking and the extension of purchasing power and marked development require time. In this context, it may be added that the marked in the country has become more accessible because of improvements in transport and communications facilities. The industrial development of a developing country like Nepal, which has need of a market and raw materials, requires facilities for international trade and transit. For this purpose, the Trade and Transit Treaty with India and its proper implementation is especially important. Our experience in industrial development has been very short and the country still lacks experts in management affairs. All possible efforts for industrial development have been made in preceeding years, even with the mentioned difficulties. Progress up-to-date The real industrial development of Nepal started as a result of the establishment of some industries due to the extraordinary international demand created during the Second World War. Several industries which had been started locked a solid base and disappeared in the post war period. Thus, there was no progress worth mentioning in the industrialization of the country until the year 1956 when the idea of planned economic development was initiated. Several industries were to be set up during the last Plan period, primarily in the private sector. However, most of the targets could not be attained because of the underdeveloped nature of the fundamental infrastructure in the private sector and because industrial policy had not been classified in an extensive manner. Certain industries also registered growth which had not been included in the Third Plan and which therefore, could be only of limited help in the development of the country. In the public sector, a sugar mill and agricultural implements factory at Birgunj, a cigarette factory at Janakpur, a leather and shoe factory and the brick and tile factory at Kathmandu were set up. In accordance with the priorities fixed in the Third Plan, a beginning was made in the establishment of a cement factory at Kathmandu, and special facilities were being provideds for the establishment of cotton textiles factory at Bhairahawa. Industrial districts were setup in Patan, Balaju and Hetauda as envisaged in the Second Plan, and preliminary work to set up industrial districts at Dharan and Nepalgunj was also started during the Third Plan period. As raw materials constitute one of the basic prerequisites of industrialization, it is necessary to have information about the country’s natural resources and their development. A survey of forest resources in the Terai arrangements for a detailed feasibility study of their industrial utilization were made during the Third Plan period. Because soil surveys are of utmost importance in the feasibility studies of commercial agriculture and preliminary works in this field has been started in the country. The study of mineral resources has also been continuing. With progress in the agricultural sector, the purchasing power of framers should be augmented which in turn should help to increase the demand for industrial goods. The development of transportation has also brought markets throughout the country nearer to one another. Legislation regarding the provision of facilities to industries and research work done in this field will also be of help in future industrial development. The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) has been set up. As industrial credit is extremely essential for the development of this sector, industrial loans amounting to Rs 543 and 113 million have been made available during the Third and Second Plan Periods, respectively. Fourth Plan The following services will be provided by this organization in the beginning: Arrangements will be made for industries getting financial assistance or special facilities to have part of theirs profits so as to increase the capacity of already existing industries or to create new industries. 1. Industrial Services Centre It is necessary to make different services available for the coordinated and well planned establishment and development of industries. During the Fourth Plan period, technical services, consulting services, feasibility studies, quality controls, etc. will either be provided through NIDC or a new autonomous organization. a. Feasibility study and Technical Services: It would make reports about different projects, after feasibility studies by Nepalese and foreign specialists were made available to the industrialists. This will be to prepare different projects for the establishment of new industries. b. Quality Control: Arrangements will also be made during the Plan period to start quality controls on all industrial products, those for exports and those intended to be consumed in Nepal. This will be implemented with the cooperation of laboratories and the Royal Drug Research Institute. Other laboratories will be set up as needed. c. Industrial Cooperative (Sajha) Center: As it is quite expensive for both small and large scale industries to repair their machinery in their own workshops and to have their own equipment for packing and weighing, industries would be helped greatly if cooperative services (Sajha) of this kind were to be made available at a reasonable cost. 2. Improvement of Currently Operating Industries: During the Plan period, industries in the public sector and some industries in the private sector will be improved in the following manner: a. Sugar Industry: There are at present three sugar mills in Nepal, including one in Birgunj in the public sector and one eachg in Bharahawa and Morang in the private sector. The production capacity of Birgunj Sugar Mill will be increased by 50 per cent which will mean a total capacity of 1500 metric tons. A fifty per cent increase in the capacity of Bhairahawa Sugar mills will also make it self-sufficient. b. Janakpur Cigarette Factory: The annual production capacity of Janakpur Cigarette Factory will be increased from 2 billion sticks. c. Agriculture Implements Factory: The production capacity of Agriculture Implement Factory at Birgunj which is in the public sector, will increase by 50 per cent. New kinds of agricultural implements will also be produced. d. Leather and Shoe Factory: It has becomenecessary to increase the production capacity of the factory, as well as to establish a slaughter house in Kathmandu in order to operate this factory profitably. That is why the production capacity of this factory will be doubled during the Plan period. Necessary facilities will also be provided to establish a slaughter house in Kathmandu in the private sector. e. Brick and Tile Factory: The production capacity of the Brick and Tile Factory situated at Harisiddhi will be doubled. f. Jute Factory: The Jute Mills at Biratnagar will be modernized and assistance including loans will be made available to start production of new goods, such as carpets. g. Tea Industry: During the Plan period, the Nepal Tea Development Corporation will cultivate tea on additional land in the Terai at Chilimkot and near the East-West Highway in Jhapa District. As tea grown in the hilly regions is suitable for export, it would be cultivated at Kanyam Area in Ilam Districts after the land is obtained for this purpose. Facilities including loans will be provided to tea plantations in the private sector for their expansion. The aim is to fulfil Nepal’s internal demands for tea and increase exports by the year 1980 by extending tea plantations, including those in NTDC and in the private sector. 3. Industries to be set up in private sector: It is not possible to speak definitely, as yet, above the industries to be setup in the private sector. Detailed studies have yet to be done in those industries, which have been found to be feasible at the present time. There is also the possibility that several other industries which have not been found to be feasible at the present time may be found to be so sometime in the future. Taking all these factors into consideration, the target for the establishment of industries in the private sector is as follows: Note: The above mentioned industries have been only given as examples. License may be issued for setting up other industries which might fall in any of these categories. 4) Industrial Investment and Loans It has already been mentioned that the private sector is going to be given the main role in setting up industries during the Plan period. It has also been stated that currend legislation wouold be revisede I accordance tiht the policy to set up more industries in the preivate sector. NIDC would also provide loans according to this policy. The approximate amounts of loans and investments to be mabe available by NIDC in the next five year is estimated to be as follows: It cannot be said that the private sector will set up all the basic and feasible industries capable of making special contributions to the industrial development of the country. The Government will attempt to establish paper, fertilizer and cement industries with the aim of gradually selling them to the private sector in the future. Rs 15 million has been allocated for such investment in the public sector during the Plan period. In addition, a factory utilizing molasses obtained from Birgunj Sugar Factory will be established. 5) Industrial Districts The following programme has been included in the Fourth Plan under this concept: a) Completion of work started in establishing industrial centers at Nepalgunj and Dharan. b) To establish another industrial center, either in Butwal or in Pokhara c) To construct twenty additional buildings at the Balaju Industrial Distric of Kathmandu and to expand Patan Industrial District, d) To complete preliminary work in establishing one more industrial district in the country based upon a feasibility study in about the third year of the Plan period. 6) Project for the development of raw materials Difficulties arise for many industries operating in Nepal because of the inadequacvy of raw materials. In view of this factor, concrete programs should be implemented during the Plan period investigating quality contro. These should be done in collaboration with the agricultural sector on such products as jute, sugarcane, tobacco, oilseeds, cotton, silk, etc. 7) Industrial Training Necessary training of a short duration and of medium standard will be given in different industrial subjest at various technical training institutions which have been set up on the country. The ability of Kathmandu, Birgunj and Hetauda Centres to give training in useful and necessary subjects will be increased. During the Plan period, managerial training being provided by NIDC will also be made more extensive. 8) Labour Welfare Scheme The contribution of labourers to the economic development of the country is very important. The all round development of the country is possible only if there is an environment of good-will between employers and employees. Concrete steps will be taken during the Plan period in the guidance of the interest of labourers, and attempts will be made to provide them with necessary training and assistance as far as possible. 9) Arrangement for Evaluation of Industrial Activities The progress and contribution to the development of the national economy made by industries in public or private sector (those operating at the present time and those to be set up on the future) will be evaluated periodically by a committee consisting of independent and impartial experts. The committee will also review the industrial development programs of HMG and the operations of financial institutions in providing investment and loan facilities. CHAPTER XXI HYDROLOGY AND METEOROLOGY Hydrological data are indispensible in the successful implementation of any hydro – electric or irrigation projects. No design of the production hydro-electric power or the area to be irrigated and distribution system of canals could possibly be done without relevant data on the discharge of the stream, including the periodic fluctuations and minimum amount of water to be available. Although the importance of such data seems to be somewhat limited at first glance, it would not be an exaggeration to state that hydrological data is the most fundamental data in any project dealing with the development of water resources. By the proper study of data on sedimentation; dams and reservoirs could be designed in such a manner that they will control “silting”. The utility of meteorological data is in such divers fields as civil aviation, agriculture, and weather forecasting. The exploration and utilization of ground water resources in a systematic way can result in large scale increases in agricultural production. Progress to date To collection and study of hydrological and meteorological data in a systematic manner was not started in Nepal until the beginning of the Second Plan. In the Second Plan, hydrological surveys were included along with soil surveys, forest resources surveys and mineral surveys. During the Second Plan, 51 steam gauging stations were built and Rs 2.68 million were spent for hydrological surveying. American Aid was also available from the beginning of Second Plan to the first half of the Third Plan for this purpose. In the Third Plan, Rs 14 million were allocated for hydrological survey and included in the Plan under a separate chapter. The target of the Third Plan was to establish 49 stream gauging stations, meteorological stations, a laboratory to analyze the quality of water and sediment samples, to begin weather forecasting, and to assess the possibility of utilizing ground water resources in Kathmandu Valley and the Terai. In the revised version of the Third Plan, it was envisaged to start an extensive exploration for groundwater in the western Terai, to continue collecting data on sedimentation, and to start preliminary work on setting up a laboratory. Weather forcasting was started durng this Plan period. But there has been hardly any progress in the collection of data on sedimentation and the interpretative study of this data as envisaged in the Third Plan. Preliminary data on ground water resources in the Terai area of Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali zones was collected. A detailed explration of ground water in the Rupandehi district of Lumbini zone (Bhairahawa area) was also started in the final year of the Third Plan with American assistance. Fourth Plan The objective of hydrological surveys is to Nepal by collecting data on surface and ground water and making available such data as it is needed in the implementation of development projects in power, drinking water and irrigation. The main objective of the meteorological survey is to make meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, humidity etc) available and to make daily weather forecasts. The following policy will be adopted in order to implement these objectives during the Fourth Plan period. The number of stream gauging stations to collect hydrological data will be further increased as needed on a regional basis. 1. Surface Water Investigation Under the Fourth Plan, 10 stream gauging stations, 20 crest gauge stations, 10 Stream gauging stations, 10 cable way, 15 automatic recorders, and 15 sediment sampling stations will be established. In addition, maintenance work on 55 stream gauging stations established in the preceeding years will be continued. Under the Fourth Plan period, 193 additional meteorological stations (for measurement of temperature rainfall etc) will be established in different parts of Nepal, and maintenance work on 70 already existing meteorological stations, will be continued. 3. Ground Water Investigation of Terai Portion of Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali Zones Ground water investigation in Nawal-Parasi and Kapilvastu districts of Lumbini zones, Banke and Bardia districts of Bheri zone, Kailali district of Seti zone, and Kanchanpur district of Mahakali zone will be completed in the first phase of the Fourth Plan period. It is hoped that agricultural production in the comparatively dry western Terai area of Nepal will be increased with the utilization of ground water developed from data collected under this programme with ground water the crops in this area will not have to depend solely upon the monsoon. 4. Preliminary work on Investigation of Ground Water Resources of Chitwan (Rapti Valley) and Dang Valley This two valleys constitute important agricultural areas of Nepal. One of the main problem in this area is a lack of an adequate amount of water for irrigation. A systematic survey of ground water resources of the two valleys will be undertaken and followed by a preliminary investigation at the end of Fourth Plan period. CHAPTER XXII EDUCATION Education plays a very significant role in improving the quality of the population. The primary necessity in the process of education development is the preparation of the educated manpower required for the all round development of the country and the provision of basic minimum education to the masses. The experiences and achievements of earlier plans have made us aware of the need to bring about basic changes in the present education system. But it is not possible to bring about changes in the education system in the short run. It is a long-term continuing process and requires some basic changes. The following targets in various education programmes are set forth in the Fourth Plan, taking these long-term objectives into consideration. It is not possible to achieve the necessary objectives within the Plan period because of limited financial resources. It is hoped that some of the policies adopted in the Fourth Plan will form the basis for future development. Primary Education The progress made so far in the field of primary education is very encouraging. The number of primary schools in the kingdom has reached 7,000. About 32 per cent of the primary school-age children have been provided with primary education facilities. Free and compulsory primary education programmes have been introduced in the village panchayats of Chitwan and Jhapa districts and in 107 other village panchayats. Fifteen model primary schools have been set up. However, inspite of this progress, primary education faces a number of problems. First of all, the number of drop-outs is very high, with a tendency for more drop-outs in the lower grades. The quality of teaching has suffered considerably due to an inadequate number of teachers in the schools. The percentage of government aid to the schools reaches a maximum of 93 per cent in some cases, indicating that local resources have not been adequately mobilized. The lack of adequate finance for other education inputs is quite obvious since more than 80 percent of the revenue is spent on salary. Considering the above facts, HMG has adopted a number of specific policies towards the development of primary education. The target of free and compulsory primary education seems difficult to attain in the near future. The Fourth Plan aims to provide primary education to 45 per cent of the primary school-going age children. To achieve this target, 7000 additional classes and a smilar number of teachers will have to be improved. In remote northern regions, it is not practical to establish schools on the basis of population, and special provisions will be made to open 250 classes on the basis of distances between villages. 1. \\tFinancing of Primary Education So far, HMG has been providing grants to the primary schools according to the number of teachers. Though the schools spend a majority portion of their income on salary, the salary scale of the teachers is very low when compared to other professions. As a result, the schools cannot obtain the services of able teachers, thereby making a great obstacle to the qualitative development of education. The regular grant would become 40 percent of the teacher’s salary in those schools where trained teachers are not available. 2. Building of Construction, Education Materials and Curriculum Improvement Other programmes for the development of primary education, in the Fourth Plan include building construction, provision of education materials to 2000 primary schools, and improvements in curriculum. 3. Scholarships To meet the shortage of teachers in the northern border regions, scholarships will be provided to students of those areas to enable them to study in the nearby high schools or training centres. Secondary Education There were 22 high and 203 middle schools in the country prior to the year 1951. With the advent of democracy the development of secondary education has been very rapid. By the end of the Third Plan, the number of high and middle schools is estimated to be 444 and 534 respectively. The secondary school enrolment is not 18 per cent o f the primary school enrolment. There has been some improvement in the quality of teaching as a result of the various teacher training programmes organized during the Third Plan period. The Fourth Plan aims to increase the secondary school enrolment to 20 per cent of the primary school enrolment. As more of the students terminate their studies after secondary education, the need to emphasize the quality of teaching, rather then the quantity has become apparent. Therefore, during the Plan period necessary restrictions will be made concerning the opening up of schools and emphasis will be given to consolidation and improvement of the existing ones. 1. \\tFinancing of Secondary Education So far, the Government grant is only 20 per cent of the total expenditure of secondary schools, with the remaining 80 percent being borne b the public. It has not been possible to run the secondary schools in an organized way, because of limited Government aid. Therefore, instead of the present system of grants, it is roposed to provide 50 percent of the salary of the secondary school teachers in the form of grants. For this, it is essential that the Educaiton Department make the necessary arrangements for the salary to be paid directly to the teachers. 2. Training in Various Subjects Intensive training in various fields has been provided to the teachers during the last few years with the objective of making the secondary school teachers more proficient in their subjects. About 1500 additional teachers will be given short-term training in science, mathematics, English, nepali and social sciences during the Plan period. 3. School Building and Hostels As 20 per cent of the existing secondary schools do not have their own buildings, it has been difficult to run them effectively. His Majesty\\'s Government will provide grants to build 30 school and 30 hostel buildings during the Plan period. The grants will cover 50 per cent of the total cost of the project. a. With a view to improve the quality of secondary schools, 500 schools will be provided with furniture and education materials. b. A model residential secondary school with a high standard of teach- about necessary improvements in the curriculum c. \\tEducation inspector offices will be strengthened for the regular inspection and guidance of secondary schools. d. \\tProvision will be made to reward teachers with prizes and other facilities of the basis of their work. Budhanilkantha School A model residential secondary school with a high standard of teaching will be established at Budhanilkantha under foreign assistance during Fourth Plan. Altogether 470 students will be accommodated in the school, and special provisions will be made to secure adequate seats for students coming from outside the Kathmandu Valley. Secondary Multipurpose Education Adult Education The adult education programme aims at gradually reducing the rate of illiteracy in the country. During the Third Plan, 1,00,000 adults are expected to become literate, and the literacy rate is expected to reach 11.8 per cent. The Fourth Plan aims to raise the literacy rate to 15 per cent. Some of this increase will be due to the primary education programme. There are, at present, 37 permanent adult education centres in the country. During the Fourth Plan , these will be further consolidated and improved and 38 additional centres will be opened. In addition a special work-oriented adult education programme will be started in Chitwan district with UNESCO assistance, and on the basis of the experience in Chitwan, such functional literacy programmes will be expanded in other areas. Higher Education Progress in higher education has been mainly in terms of quantity during earlier Plans. In comparison to 29 colleges at the beginning of the Third Plan, the number of colleges at present has reached 40. A high percentage of the high school graduates are enrolled in the colleges with a majority of them taking liberal art subjects. The higher education programme in the Fourth Plan will be formulated with a long-term view to make it qualitative and more practical. Emphasis will be given to vocational oriented education at the secondary level in order to control the increasing trend towards the non-vocational type of higher education. In order to fulfil the above objectives, the following steps will be taken in the Fourth Plan period: 1. His Majesty\\'s Government will formulate a specific policy on the expansion of higher education 2. The opening up of new colleges during the Plan period will be generally restricted. 3. Institutions of post S.L.C. standard offering diplomas and degrees in various vocational subjects will be established. 4. An effective policy of science education aimed at facilitating its spread in the colleges will be formulated. 1. Improvement of Colleges The colleges of Kathmandu Valley seems to attract a large number of students from outside the Valley because of a lack of facilities for various subjects in the colleges outside the Valley. In order to provide better facilities for higher education on a regular basis, five colleges lying outside Kathmandu Valley will be improved to include most faculties and subjects, with laboratory, library and hostel facilities. The financial aid provided to the colleges will be regulated by enforcing a set criteria on the subjects studied in the college, the number of students, and the general standards. 2. Tribhuvan University Tribhuvan University, being an autonomous institution, will implement the higher education development programme in the Fourth Plan in accordance with the policy set by His Majesty\\'s Government. Teachers Training The quality of education and teaching depends largely on the efficiency of teachers. As a primary step towards improvements in education, it is necessary to increase the number of trained teachers in the primary and secondary schools. During the Plan period, necessary arrangements will be made to provide training to 6500 primary school teachers. 1. College of Education The College of Education established in the yrear 1956, provides I. Ed. It also has an extension for I. Ed. Classes in Birgunj. The College of Education will provide training to 320 secondary school teachers during the Plan period. 2. Laboratory School A laboratory School is being operated as a demonstration institution for all the secondary schools of the country. This institution will be further developed. 3. National Vocational Training Centre The center gives training in subjects like agriculture, education, home science and industrial trades. The Centre established in 1966 has produced 206 vocational teachers, 375 diploma holdes, and110 persons miscellaneous subjects by the end of the Third Plan. During the Fourth Plan a regular two years diploma couse training programme has been arranged to train 500 candidates and to prepare them as semi-skilled technicians. In addition, in-service training will be provided to 500 trainees in various vocational subjects. Physical Education Various sports events are being organized in various schools and colleges, with the objective of improving the standard of sports and developing the health of the students and youths. This programme will be implemented more efficiently during the Plan period. To fulfil the gap of trained instructors in Physical Education in various schools, emphasis will be given to teacher training. A stadium will be constructed. Since no survey has yet been conducted on the activities of physical education in various schools of the kingdom, such survey will also be undertaken. Steps towards improving the question papers, research on the better methods of conducting examinations, and modern and scientific ways of evaluation will be attempted in this programme. In addition, research will be carried out on various reactions to the examination system. Science Development The standard of science education in the primary and secondary schools is very low. Moreover, teaching of science as not been in accordance with the required objectives. The Fourth Plan aims to improve the curriculum, the training of science teachers, the production of scientific and educational equipment and their distribution, in order to make science education in the schools more useful and practical. The science education development programme (STEP Programme) will be introduced to 50 middle schools during the Fourth Plan. The text books for the 10th grade and other booklets will be prepared for distribution. Janak Education Material Centre A press room will be constructed and the office building will be extended Sanskrit Institute Necessary arrangements will be made for the establishment of the Central Sanskrit Institute to organize research in Sanskrit by coordinating the work of present institutions. Planning, Statistics, Research Programme Since educational statistics are of great value Fourth Plan planning, the collection and publication of various kinds of educational statistics on an annual basis for use by general public will be continued in the Fourth Plan. CHAPTER XXIII HEALTH SERVICES The economic and social development of the country is possible only with the healthy physical and mental condition of the people. So, the development of health services has a direct hearing on the economic development of a country. The objective of health service development is to make available efficient manpower for the development of the country. The long-term objective of His Majesty\\'s Government is to make health services available as widely as possible throughout the country by utilizing the available limited economic and technical resources. Health services programmes under the Fourth Plan can be roughly divided into three main categories. These are preventive measures, curative services, and health education and training. .the Plan has given priority to preventive measures since prevention of disease is simpler and less expensive than cures. In the field of curative services, existing health offices will be improved and strengthed. At present, a number of health projects under the Health Services Department are running with separate offices and personnel in every district. Since this arrangement seems too expensive in view of our limited economic and technical resources, the various preventive health projects will be unified at the central and lower operational levels. a. \\tZonal Health Office Zonal health offices have been established in Kosi, Janakpur, Narayani, Lumbini and Bheri zones to prepare the health services programme according to the specific needs of each zone, to provide for the necessary medicine, equipment and personnel for the various health programmes in each zone, and to bring about proper coordination between the preventive and curative services in each zone. During the Fourth Plan, two new health offices will be opened in Sagarmatha and Gandaki zones, and the existing offices will be strengthened by providing building and other technical facilities. According to the needs of each zone, 50 to 100 bed hospitals will be provided under the zonal offices, and these zonal hospitals will be consolidated as ‘referal’ centers to the 25 district level hospitals. b. District Health Office The district health office aims to extend the health service programme as far as possible in each concerned district. During this Plan period, district level public health offices will be established in the seven zones referred to above. The Health Post is the basic unit of health services at the local level. The Health Post is the basic unit of health services at the local level. They will be established on the basis of geographical situations, as well as population. The malaria eradication activities in many parts of the Central zone have been completed, but due to the lack of proper health offices, these areas have not been able to reach the maintenance phase. The case is similar in the eastern zone and, to some extent, in the western zone. The Fourth Plan aims to establish health posts at the ratio of 1 to 25,000 people. Besides malaria maintenance activities, these health posts will perform multipurpose activities such as primary medical care, health education, control of our communicable diseases, collection of statistics, etc. This will economize on the resource utilization by avoiding duplication of health institutions. About 62,00,000 people of Nepal live in the malarious areas. On the basis f population, some 240 health-posts are necessary to take care of these areas. The number of health-posts in the country was 33 by the end of the Third Plan period. Therefore, the Fourth Plan aims at establishing 200 additional health posts in order to meet the requirement. Five additional health posts will be established annually to provide basic health services in the hills. Because of transport and communication problems in the mountain region, there will be one health post for every 8,000 to 10,000 person. Thus, the total of 225 health posts will be given training according to requirements in some remote areas where health facilities do not exist, health centers with medical officers will be established with the aim of brining about coordination between preventive and curative services in the area. Preventive Health Services a. \\tMalaria Eradication By the end of the Third Plan, out of the total population of 6.2 million living in malarious areas in the country, 45 percent has been covered by the ‘consolidation phase’ and 46 percent has been reached by the ‘attack phase’. It was originally planned to bring 50 percent of the malarious areas of the central and eastern zone s into the maintenance phase within the first year of the Fourth Plan. But, in the absence of a basic health infrastructure to take over these activities, only 10 per cent of the areas is expected to enter the maintenance phase by the first year of the Plan. Depending on the progress in establishing a health infrastructure by the end of the Fourth Plan, 75 percent of the malarious areas of the country will enter the maintenance phase with 25 per cent taken into the consolidation phase. No area will remain in the attack phase. b. \\tLeprosy Control The leprosy control programme is in operation in Bagmati and Narayani zones. During the Fourth Plan, the programme will be extended to Janakpur, Sagarmatha, Kosi, Mechi and Lumbini zones. Under this project, programmes of school-health-activities to discover leprosy cases, population surveys, examinations of germs, the establishment of new treatment centers, and the training of auxiliary health workers will be conducted. d. \\tSmall-Pox Control During the Third Plan nearly 5.4 million persons received vaccination against small-pos. in this Plan period, the programme is to vaccinate 80 pe rcent of population and to revaccinate them as necessary in various parts of the country. e. \\tFamily Planning and Maternity and Child Health The main objective of the family planning programme is to raise the living standard of the general public by bringing about a proper balance between production and population growth. The family planning programme was included in the National Plan for the first time in 1965. And since the fourth year of the Third Plan, this programme has been intensively operated as the Family Planning and Maternity and Child Health Project. During the Third Plan period. In the Fourth Plan period, 260 clinics will be established in different parts of the country. The number of district offices will be raised from 25 to 40. The programme intends to provide family planning services to 15 per cent of married couples. The facilities of B.C.G., small-pox, Polio, D.P.T. vaccinations and other treatment will be provided to 4,00,000 children under 5 years of age. Other programmes include the training of health personnel of different levels, the construction of necessary buildings, and wider publicity on the values of family planning. Curative Services Attempts will be made to bring about greater coordination between the preventive and curative services, although the preventive health service is given in the Plan. Progress in the field of health services in Nepal during the last few years has been considerable. At present there are 54 hospitals with about 1875 hospital beds, and the number of doctors has reached 300. Since a large number of these are centered at Kathmandu and a few other urban areas, the facilities for curative services in other parts of the country are negligible. So keeping in view the growing demand of the people curative health services, the Fourth Plan aims to increase the number of beds and other facilities in the existing hospitals and to provide some facilitie s for specialized treatment at the zonal hospitals. The existing hospitals will be developed into three categories: 50 to 100-bed zonal hospitals, 25 and 15-bed hospitals. As far as possible, uniformity will be maintained in the provision of similar technical and other facilities in all hospitals of the same category. a. 50 to 100-bed hospitals At present there are 50-bed hospitals in Butwal, Jaleswar, Pokhara, Biratnagar, Birgunj and Nepalgunj. But they do not posses all the facilities necessary for 50-bed hospitals. So in the Fourth Plan, all the 50-bed hospitals will be developed into ‘referal’ hospitals, and the necessary technical personnel, apparatus and other facilities will be provided. Due to the increasing number of patients and the growing demand for hospital beds, the Biratnagar hospital will be converted into 100-bed hospital by providing 50 additional beds, similarly the Rajbiraj hospital will be converted into a 50-bed hospital by adding 25 maternity beds. b. 25-bed hospital At present, there are four 25-bed hospitals in Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Gaur, and Hetauda. In the Fourth Plan period, Bhadrapur and Janakpur hospitals will be converted into 25-bed hospitals. c. \\t15-bed hospital At present there are eighteen 15-bed hospitals in Ilam, Kalaiya, Dang, Dhankuta, Rangeli, Sirha, Bhojpur, Doti, Taulihawa, Baglung, Sarlahi, Jumla, Dadeldhura, Parsai, Kailali, Bhairahawa, Dharan, and Bandipur but many of them are not functioning satisfactorily due to the absence of necessary personnel, equipment, and other facilities. In the Fourth Plan period, these hospitals will be provided with the necessary facilities. The hospitals of Shivraj, Bardia, Inarwa, currently with less than 15-beds, will be converted into 15-bed hospitals. e. \\tHealth Centres In the Plan period, there is no programme for establishing new health centres. The existing health centres and dispensaries will be converted into 15-bed hospitals or health posts. Training Special attention will be given to a training programme to execute the proposed programmes of the health services in a more organized and planned way. Within the Plan period, it is not possible to provide the services of doctors in all parts of the country because of economic, technical, and administrative constraints. The number of doctors available during the Plan period will, therefore, be sufficient to run the proposed programme of health services. Courses of public health orientation and graduate and post graduate training in various public health subjects will, therefore, be arranged in order to secure sufficient doctors in the field of preventive services. Some will be sent abroad for specialized training, but only according to needs. It is estimated that within the Fourth Plan period, the number of graduate nurses will reach 200. To reach this, the present intake of 40 students in Nurses Training School will be increased and additional facilities such as a staff building, educational materials, and apparatus will be provided to the School. Along with the graduate nurses training, provisions for postgraduate training will be arranged. Special attention will be given to public health nurses training for the running of regional health programmes and other preventive health services. b. \\tAuxiliary Health Workers Training According to the target to open 225 additional health posts within the Plan period, 450 auxiliary health workers will be needed. Moreover, since auxiliary health workers have to be provided in each of the zonal offices and hospitals, 150 more auxiliary health workers will be required. To achieve this new hostels and other buildings and an increased staff will be provided to the Auxiliary Health Workers School. The capacity of the school will be increased in order to organize refresher training courses for malaria inspectors and supervisors working under the Malaria Eradication Programme and for the existing dressers, compounders, and health assistants. Practical public health training will be provided in two village panchayats. c. \\tAssistant Nurses Midwife Training The Assistant Nurse Midwife Training Schools at present are running in Bharatpur, Biratnagar and Nepalgunj. They have a capacity of training 15 people semi-annually. But during the Plan period, 900 additional Assistant Nurses Mid-wives will be needed, 500 A.N.M’s will be required for the 225 health posts, 250 will be needed for hospitals and zonal health offices, and 150 will be needed for existing health institutions. This additional requirment will be met by the candidates sent abroad on training under the Family Planning Programme. Since the Nepalgunj training center does not possess its own building, a new building will be constructed. d. \\tLaboratory Assistant Training To meet the shortage of laboratory technicians in the country, training was started in 1968 at the local Central Health Laboratory, and in the current Plan period, training will be given to 60 laboratory assistants. Training will also be given to 500 health assistants and 60 other persons for a period of 3 and 6 months respectively. e. \\tX-Ray Technician Training There are, at present, 14 X-ray machines in the country, but many of them are not in operation becuae of the shortage of technicians. Miscellaneous a. Epidemiology Section An Epidemiology section will be created to examine prevalent diseases of the country. This section will be created under the public health section of the Directorate of Health Service in order to make public health administration effective. b. Health Education A planned health education programme is important for the successful implementation of health service activities. The health education programme of the Fourth Plan includes school health education, training, and the production of educational materials. The zonal health education section will also be developed. c. \\tCentral Health Laboratory During the Plan period, the Central Health Laboratory will be developed. Investigations and research on different kinds of diseases, germs and other public aand health problems will be studied. The chemical examination of foodstuffs and blood will also be conducted. d. \\tAyurvedic Medicine In our country where the facilities for medical services are not adeaquate, Ayurvedic treatment  is very important. According to the policy of encouraging Ayurvedic treatment, attention will be given to Ayurvedic research. For this, the necessary arrangements for medical herbs and other materials will be made and a few dispensaries will be established in some districts. To raise the standard of Ayurvedic teaching, steps will be taken towards the conversion of Ayurvedi School into a College. Baidyakhana will be provided with modern equipment for the production and sale of medicines. e. \\tHomeopathic Hospital A 25-bed hospital with facilities for maternity and child health will be established f. \\tMobile Medical Relief Team Medical relief teams will be sent to those areas where proper health facilities do not exist. g. \\tMental Hospital In this Plan period, the purchase of land and other necessary provisions will be made for the establishment of a mental hospital h. \\tConstructions and Improvement Some of the hospital buildings will be repaired and some new constructions will be made. Hospitals will be provided with additional facilities. i. Medical College The purchase of land and provision of other necessary facilities will be made during the Plan period for the establishment of a medical college in Nepal. CHAPTER XXIV DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION There is a need for the adequate provision of drinking water and the proper management of sewerage system for the protection of health and sanitation in the community. In the absence of such services, there are possibilities of cholera, typhoid, dysentry and other communicable diseases. Since it is the objective of His Majesty\\'s Government to expand these services as much as resources permit, various drinking water projects have been started since the beginning of planning in our country. The following table shows the progress in this field during the various Plan periods. Plan. The number of drinking water projects implemented by the Government will reach 50, and about 6,00,000 people will benefit from them. The above figures make it clear that only six per cent of the country’s total population have been provided with piped drinking water with the average per capita consumption rate of about 16 gallons per day. This can hardly be called satisfactory. The drinking water and sewerage programmes formulated for this Plan period have kept in mind the existing transportation facilities, and the level of administrative and technical capabilities. Surveys of the water resources of the country will be conducted and reports on feasible projects will be prepared. The programmes of drinking water and sewerage for the Fourth Plan have been broadly divided in the following way: 1. New Projects (a) \\tDrinking water: Drinking water projects have been undertaken or are in progress in 12 zonal and 33 district headquarters out of a total of 14 and 75 respectively. During the Plan period, 37 drinking water projects in district and zonal headquarters and selected village panchayats will be started. An outline summary of the main drinking water projects to be implemented during the Plan period, the quantity of water available, the number of people to benefit and the cost of estimate are given in the following table: (b) \\tSewerage System: In the Fourth Plan sewerage disposal has been given priority in those urban areas where drinking water facilities already exist. A project report will be prepared after a survey regarding sewerage has been conducted. A Master Plan for Kathmandu Valley will be prepared in connection with the long- term planning of drinking water and sewerage with the assistance of the United Nations Development Fund. 2. Continuing Projects Numerous projects that were started during the last Plan remains to be completed during the Fourth Plan period. A summary of these continuing projects, the estimated production of water, and the number of people to benefit from them is presented in the following Table: After completion of these projects, the supply of drinking water will be increased by an additional 24,55,200 gallons per day and 1,25,900 additional people will be provided with piped drinking water facilities. 3. Survey and Project Report With a view to providing drinking water in as many different places as possible, feasibility reports containing project maps and estimated costs will be prepared after field surveys are done. 4. Establishment of Laboratory A laboratory will be established during the Plan period to conduct the examination of chemical composition of the water, various technical studies necessary to maintain the standard of water, and provision of easy means for the maintenance and repair of different projects. 5. Miscellaneous Necessary arrangement for the improvements and modernization (e.g. fixing of metres, filteration etc.) and for the repair and maintenance of the existing drinking water projects will be made during the Plan period. Statistical data constitute the main basis for drafting development projects. It could be said that any attempt to prepare a plan without statistics is an exercise in impossibility. One of the main reasons, the preceeding plans were not as practicable or successful as they should have been, was the lack of relevant statistics. Statistics development was given its due place in the preceeding Plan periods so that such deficiencies could be overcome and proper information regarding the state of affairs of different sectors could be obtained. Nepal does not have a very long history of collecting and analyzing statistical data. Although the tradition of census taking was initiated in the year 1911, the collection of data regarding agriculturel industry and other social and economic matters was started only in the past decade. Data are already available in the following areas: agriculture and population census of the year 1961-62, estimation of gross domestic product since the year 1964-65, and statistics dealing with export and import since the year 1956-57. In order to make these more effective and intensive, the organizational structure of Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has been made more functionally oriented since the last year of the Third Plan and its status has been upgraded to that of general direcorate. In order to make these more effective and intensive, the organizational structure of Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has been made more functionally oriented since the last year of the Third Plan and its status has been upgraded to that of general direcorate. It has been customary to send personnel from the center to collect data dealing with the regions. The construction of a new building has also been completed in order to cope with the problems of space resulting from the extension of function and organization of the Bureau. Fourth Plan In order to make statistical information dependable as possible and to make it available promptly, several projects involving standardization, coordination and mechanization will be done during the Fourth Plan period. Also, duplication may arise because statistical data collected by one institution may be collected by another. Arrangements to control such duplication will be made during the Fourth Plan. Even if the collection of statistical data is done by other departments, computation, coordination and standardization of such data will be done by Central Bureau of Statistics. Major undertaking of census and surveying will be done only by CBS. Programme a. The decinnial census of Nepal will be taken iin the year 1971. It will be possible to collect more information than was possible previously and to make it confirm to international standards. Because labour statistics have been lacking, manpower has been difficult. Necessary questions regarding labour will be included in the census questionnaire to be used in the year 1971. b. Since agricultural statistics are specially important in our country, it has become necessary to have an agricultural census taken once every decade. The first agricultural census of Nepal was taken in the year 1961 and was confined to selected villages. In order to make the census 1971 (2028) more dependable, it will be done in the wards comprising 15 percent of the Village Panchayat of the country. c. \\tSurveys regarding the population should be done every two years in order to determine periodic increase in population and other relevant factors. This will be done in the third and fifth year of the Plan. d. \\tIn addition to the programmes mentioned above, the following works will be done during the Fourth Plan period. (a) \\tAnimal Resources Survey (b) \\tAgricultural Investment Survey (c) \\tInternal Trade Survey (d) \\tIndustrial Census (f) \\tFamily Survey 5. In order to have such data analyzed and published as fast as possible, modern computing machines and relevant equipment will be installed n the Building of the Bureau. The accordance with the aim to increase G.D.P. as much as possible and to extend the infrastructure required for the future development, the Plan has been formulated on the basis of those resources felt to be available. The estimation of the actual increase in G.D.P. generated by the proposed investment has been based on an assumed capital-output ratio. As an estimate made on such a theoretical basis is bound to contain several short-coming, its utility is in fact debatable. If it is assumed in the context of the present economic system of Nepal, that the data available on output and capital formation demonstrate the relation between the two correctly, then theory would succeed in giving some numerical indication of the annual growth rate in G.D.P. and investment required for this purpose. It would also give some information regarding periodic national development projects, and their influence on the economic system of the country. The estimate of Gross Capital Formation during the period between 1964-65 and 1967-68 has also been made by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Since this estimate was made on the basis of current prices, it is necessary to convert it to the price level of 1964-65. However, since there is no official index estimates, the Indian price index was used in the case of machinery and chemicals and the Kathmandu price index in the case of other commodities. Thus, Gross Capital Formation estimated to be Rs 1006.7 million at the current price level is only Rs 929.9 million when 1964-65 prices are held constant. The figure on Gross Capital Formation obtained by Central Bureau of Statistics still needs to be revised, taking into consideration several factors. The figure for machinery between the years 1966- 67 and 1967-68 should not have decreased. The reasons for the decrease are still to be found out. In addition, expenditures for transportation and the installation of machinery have been not added to the calculations. Construction work done by government corporatio ns and other industrial institutions have also not yet been added. On the basis of these changes the figure of Gross Capital Formation between the years 1964-65 and 1967-68 has been found to have increased from Rs 929.9 million to Rs 1250 million. A detailed description regarding these sources has been presented elsewhere, but it is estimated that Rs 600 million needed for residential building construction will be available automatically. No consideration has been given whether this amount will be available from financial institution or from the public sector. From the above exercise, it is important to think about certain basic factors. Although necessary policy for investing Rs 3,530 million during the Fourth Plan period have been formulated, the expansion of the financial system is expected to be quite substantial. In view of increase in credit, deficit financing through loan by the Rastra Bank, and local expenditures to be spent from foreign aid, the purchasing power of currency will increase at a rate greater than total investment. The National Planning Commission has prepared the following guideline for classification of development expenditure. This new classification for regular and development expenditure will be followed by Ministry of Finance and will be made applicable from the coming fiscal year 1970-71. 1. All new investments projects except the following will be treated as developmental: (a) \\tDefence (b) \\tPolice and internal security (c) \\tForeign service (d) \\tInvestment for such projects as construction of monuments, statues, museums and parks meant for the direct benefit of the public. (e) \\tConstruction of government building and purchase of equipment for general administrative purposes. 2. Expenditure for major renewal work of continuing projects, except for the above mentioned purposes, will be considered to be developmental. 3. All expenditure dealing with research works, pilot studies and special surveys will be considered to be developmental. 4. Any programme or project whose expenditures are largely recurring, rather than in the form of investment, will be considered to be developmental only if it has direct impact on output and productivity. 5. Investment in and capital loans to other government agencies and public commodity-operations will be treated as developmental. 6. Transfers to other agencies of HMG purposes will be considered developmental only if the end use of the transfer coincides with the above five guidelines. It is necessary to clarify here that neither all capital expenditure should be considered development expenditure nor all annual expenditure regular expenditure. Whether such expenditures are to be classified as regular or developmental expenditure depends on the type of programme or project and their consistency with the six guidelines of the Planning Commission. From this point of view, the following general rules have been proposed for classification of the budget. 2. All capital expenditures will be considered to be developmental expenditure, with the following exceptions: (a) \\tConstitutional organs, viz. His Majesty the King, Royal family, National Panchayat, Auditor General’s Office, Supreme Court, Public Service Commission and Election Commission. (b) \\tGeneral Administration viz. Cabinet, Secretariat of HMG, District Administration, Police, Jails and Miscellaneous Departments. (c) \\tRevenue Administration, viz. Land Revenue, Customs, Excise, Tax,Revenue Tax Court. (d) \\tMint and Accountant General’s Office (e) \\tJudicial Administration (f) \\tForeign Service (g) \\tDefence (h) \\tFacilities for sports and recreation and items of direct public consumption viz. Parks, Playgrounds, Monuments, Temples, Museums, Zoo, Theater, Archeology etc (i) \\tCentral directorates established for the purpose of supervision and direction in the sectors of economic and social services and (j) \\tMetric Measurement Project 3. All recurring expenditures except the following will be considered regular expenditures. Special kinds of health programmes having a targeted date of completion viz. Malaria Education, Eradication of Smallpox, Tuberculosis, etc. (b) \\tFamily Planning (c) \\tLand Reforms (d) \\tProgrammes dealing with special kind of survey, pilot study and research. (e) \\tTechnical and vocational education and special training projects. (f) \\tPopularization and distribution of agricultural inputs e.g. seeds, fertilizers etc. (h) \\tSpecial area development project like Jiri Multipurpose Project and Trishuli Watershed Project. (i) \\tGrants and loans made to financial institutions and development agencies like NIDC, Agricultural Development Bank, Land Reform Saving Corporation, Agricultural Supply Corporation and Nepal Rehabilitation Company. In according with the above guidelines regular expenditures now included in the development budget and development expenditures now included in the regular budget have been separated. In the present regular budget there are comparatively few items which can be termed developmental. Nevertheless, it is suggested that such expenditures be shifted to development side. In this manner, the following expenditures should be transferred from regular to development. Present Regular grant No. 27 Education Capital grants to educational institutions, capital expenditures, scholarships, and student allowances given in educational institutions operated by HMG. Regular Budget allocation No. 28 Health Capital grants to private heath institutions, capital expenditure in existing hospitals, health centers, health posts and clinics, all expenditures for health training. Planning involves a judicious programming of priorities whereby the achievements of certain goals is related to short and long term time factors. Since regions vary in resource endowment, development activities lead to significant transformations in the spatial articulation of the economy. Any development strategy for stimulating growth should, therefore, take full cognizance of the spatial dimension. Development is highly competitive in its locational policies and calls for a conscious regional strategy that promotes redistribution of resources, while maximizing economic growth and national welfare. National development programmes as such offer little scope for analysis and action at the regional level since the analysis relies largely on macro-economic variables and aggregate data. Also, the sectoral programme may not be well integrated in their locational aspect. The long-term objective of planning, however, is not merely an attainment of broad national targets, but also the development of resources in different regions in order to share the benefits of development as widely as possible without slowing down the overall growth. Regional development planning is a comprehensive approach towards the reconciliation of economic and social aims, as well as a means of broadening the scope of the allocative processes of the national plan. Comprehensive regional planning defines national policies with regard to regional economic disaggregation, as well as the integration of local activities and actions for problem areas. Regional planning provides an important link between the micro-analytical concerns at the local level and the macro-economic objectives at the national level by stressing the coordinative relations between programmes in particular localities and new resources combination for improved land use. The consideration of the national objectives and regional challenges of national planning indicates a close relationship between national and regional economic planning. Regional planning is a technique which attempts to accelerate the attainment of the national development objectives and the collection of data for improved planning in specific geographical areas. Regional planning techniques prevent the scattering of scarce resources in an imbalanced manner by concentrating investment efforts in selected areas. By concentrating the efforts in judiciously selected areas, regional planners are in a position to incorporate the exact location of investment projects and to link the projects in a logical investment sequence. The main difference between regional and national planning techniques, therefore, is in the degree of detailed planning. National and regional growth and development are, therefore, complementary aspects of the same cumulative process. Regional development policies should be considered as a tool for comprehensive development at the national level, in which all parts of the country contribute in their own way to the attainment of national objectives such a regional approach is particularly relevant to Nepal which exhibits a high degree of spatial diversity and a low economic level, thereby necessitating a careful allocation of scarce resources. 1. REGIONAL DISPARITY The physical settings of Nepal, encompassing the plains, hills and mountains, yields three broad geographic regions, each with its own distinctive environment. The Terai Region (including inner Terai) refers to the low-lane lying tropical plains along the southern part of the country. The Terai, once a harsh zone due to malaria, has since acquired greater economic importance, because of its rich forest an and agricultural resources. Its comparative advantages in transportation and consequent industrialization has further enhanced the region’s growth potential. The hill or pahar Region, traversing the sup-tropical belt, has been the traditionally most highly populated zone of the country. Subsistence agriculture is the basis of hill economy, accompanied by considerably pressure by population on land resources. The Himalayan Region, including the temperate highlands and trans-Himalayan Bhotea Valleys, has been a marginal area for human occupance because of its harsh environmental conditions. Population is sparse and the main economic activities are barter trade, animals and some agriculture. These geographic regions correspond to the altitudinally arranged ecological zones and naturally imply inherent differences in natural endowment. The regional disparity is amply demonstrated by the man/land ratio among the regions (Table I). The Himalayan and Hill region converting two-thirds of the total area and supporting 60 per cent of the population have less than a third of the total cultivated area, indicating a heavy pressure of population on limited agricultural land. Another dimension to this problem is the weak link between the food-deficit Hills (where majority of the population live) and the food-surplus Terai region. High transport cost discourage retail marketing and inter regional trade so that the circulation of goods and services is dependent upon the large -scale mobility of population. The traditional circulation pattern of trading with Tibet in summer, when the mountain passes become snow free, and with India in winter, when malaria was less dangerous, has experienced fundamental changes during the last decade due to the malaria eradication in the south and dislocation of trade in the north. The malaria eradication programme in the Terai has had a particularly important ecological impact on the spatial dimension of the country by strengthening the link with the south. The former two-way traffic between the north and south has been superseded by the gradual expansion of the southern markets. The increasing dominance of the Terai (or Indian markets) is not due to rich resources alone, but also to the comparative advantage of the Terai in the field of development activities. In the present context, the Terai has become an area where development efforts in the agricultural, forestry,and transport sectors have increased rapidly. The development of transport in Terai has led to increased circulation and concomitant urbanization associated with commerce and industry. Such an overt emphasis on the economic growth of the Terai may be defined by saying that initial development activities should take place in the regions of greatest potential so that the economic gains of such  programme might be later utilized for use in other backward areas. But such polarization of development effort would mean neglecting the greater part of the country. The density of population in  the Hills has reached almost a crucial level endangering the very ecological balance. The present pattern of development offers no alternative to the further deterioration of the Hills economy to the eventual point when it will become difficult to provide even basic services. It is indicative of the fact that in the initial stages of development, regional inequality increases more sharply due to a number of disequilibrium effects. Again, in countries where industrialization is in early stages, the initial establishment of major industries in certain areas leads to a covergence of industries since these nuclei can be self-generating. This tendency is particularly striking in the case of Kathmandu Valley which has received over one-third of all development projects since the beginning of the planning process. There are inherent problems in a policy of too much concentration in metropolitan Kathmandu, as well as in emphasizing diverse development activities within the Terai Region. The Terai may be a lucrative proposition as a newly-opened settlement area for the landless, but what of the future when this “living space” is also used up? Another problem relates to land use allocation between agriculture, forestry and industry within a limited space of the Terai. The implications of such a polarization of development can be far reaching in the whole complex of the settlement pattern and population dynamics. If the migration of the population from the Hills to the lower elevations continues at the present rate one inevitably foresees a rapid depopulation of the hills and mountains, thereby contributing to even larger regional differentials. A review of development efforts now in operation has been towards accentuating inherent natural differences through unplanned investment. The excessive concentration of economic and social activities in a few centers implies the desire to maintain the rest of the country as a stagnant residual and to create depressed areas on the one hand and physical urban maladies on the other. Therefore, the need is shown for regional planning, whereby inherent disequilibrium will be minimized by conscious spatial control of the national development programme. II. Objectives of Regional Planning (2) \\tIntegration of the national economy (3) \\tBreaking the vicious circle (4) \\tElimination of imbalances among projects (5) \\tAnalysis of regional economic structure 1. Reduction of inter-regional disparities The preceeding section amply reveals the North-South dualism (Hills vs. Terai), as well as the urban-rural dichotomy (Kathmandu vs. other districts) in terms of resources endowment and development efforts. The policy of balanced development envisaged for the Fourth Plan does not mean pure equalization among regions. This is neither possible due to differences in resources nor feasible in economic terms. The aim is rather towards a greater equalization between regions compatible with socio-political needs and financial resources of the country. The present overt emphasis is in the development of Kathmandu Valley and the eastern Terai does not augur well for the long-term development of the country, since the answer to the question of whether Nepal’s economy will ever reach an acceptable level of development capable of continous growth will depend in large part on the sound economic development of the hilly region which support a large part of the population. A regional approach does not mean an equal distribution of resources in each and every region, but an initiation of comprehensive spatial planning in representative of regions with good potential for economic growth and the sharing of benefits accured. Such regional investment patterns could be spelled out in the form of explicit long-term plans through regional development planning. 2. Integration of National Economy The increasing dualism between the Mountains and Hills on the one hand and the Terai on the other is both an economic and political reality, and it is imperative that this differential be minimized. With the exception of Kathmandu Valley (which covers a more fraction of the hills area), development activities are most pronounced in the peripheral Terai region. The grain surplus from this region is primarily exported to India, instead of catering to the food-deficit hill areas. The cereal grains from the Terai should be delivered to the needy Hills, but this is possible only if the Hills have something to offer in exchange. However, the Hills have very few surplus products to offer because relatively few development efforts have taken place in the hill and mountain areas when compared to those in the Terai. This is the reason why a gradual shift of investment from the Terai to the Hills should be undertaken in order to exploit fully the potentialities of the Hills. Such a shift in development effort is also justified by the realization that a large part of the investment made in the Terai are consumed by the Indian . economy because of the close economic relations between the two coterminous areas. Moreover, the desirability of political integration of the North (Bhot and Pahar) and the South (Madesh) of the country is best attained through economic circulation between these different geographical regions. ‘The opening of new roads supposedly implies the opening of new markets’. The opening of new markets implies increased economic activity, and hence a higher standard of living. The above statement indicates that transport facilities are essential for further development. But it is erroneous to presume that transport facilities alone will “automatically” induce economic progress. Experience has shown in Nepal that the construction of roads should be preceeded by a through evaluation of the regional impact of the road, as well as simultaneous planning of economic activities in the service area. The greater the time-lag between road construction and the generation of supporting activities, the higher the economic cost of maintenance and repair. Therefore, a crucial problem facing Nepal today is the poor position of the economy which does not allow for the construction of major north-south roads, whereas the lack of such a circulation is weakening the economic and political link among the regions. This realization is significant enough to arrive at the following dual conclusion: (i) \\tEven though the extent of economic activities prevailing in the Hills does not economically justify the construction of major north-south roads, the implementation of these roads cannot be postponed much longer. (ii) \\tThe implementation of north-south roads can greatly contribute to the further development of Nepal only if the planning of these roads is complemented by the planning of regional economic activities in the Hills. 4. Elimination of Imbalances among Projects The elimination of imbalances between various projects depends largely on the scheduling and implementation of independent projects within a geographical location. Lack of locational considerations in coordinating sectoral activities in Nepal’s past planning efforts is exemplified by the numerous instances of over capacity and under utilization of project e.g. overburdened canals (Pokhara), under used hydro- power (Trishuli) roads with minimal vehicular traffic (Kodari road), and intensive projects without a road link (Jiri). Imbalances between projects resulting in waste of resources are also to be found in the institutional framework. In the agricultural sector, for example, the branch offices of various agencies when not located together, create practical problems for the farmer. Similarly, problem-oriented regional projects like the Rapti Project (resettlement), Jiri Project (Agricultural extension), Trishuli Project (resources management ) have inevitably ended up with accretion of numerous supporting activities. A comprehensive regional approach at the initial stages would have better equipped these project to deal with totality of their service area. The feature of imbalanced capacities of projects and programmes is primarily the result of the lack of coordination between projects at particular localities and the paucity of regional statistical data necessary for proper project evaluation. Regional planning, by providing horizontal spatial dimension to the vertical dimension of the sectoral programmes, would focus on the complementarily among and between projects. 5. Analysis of Regional Economic Structure There is a great lack of data regarding population dynamics, input-output relationships, trade patterns, savings and capital formation, although these are essential to improve planning techniques both at the national and regional levels. Each regional economy is endowed with a varying amount of physical and human resources and there is an urgent need for evaluating these resources, as well as the market and service industry potentials for the different regions of the country. The basic obstacles to the development and implementation of regional programmes is the low level of regional information and statistics. Emphasis should, therefore, be placed on diagnostic survey activities to locate and explore available resources as well as to ascertain potentials and constraints for development. Regional planning would accelerate the process of assessing the resources and growth potential of the regions by using regional surveys and research studies into land capability, agricultural efficiency, accessibility, settlement pattern and industrial location. A detailed investigation is selected areas is most relevant to Nepal where there are great variations in the land-form, land-use structure become of sharp contrasts in regional physical complexes. Such surveys for specific areas in the process of regional development planning would provide insight into the reality of regions and improve the process of development planning. Allocation of Resources Regional planning serves the purpose of translating the national planning objectives and package of investment into their regional locational settings so that the different regions and sectors can develop accordingly in order to maximize the effects of the national plans investment potential. The regional economic policy should be much as to determine the nature of the contribution that each region would make to the totality of national targets and to regulate the pattern of resources use according to the most pressing socio-economic priorities. In order to achieve a more balanced growth of the nation set out in the plan objective, overt polarization of development should be concentrated by rational regional distribution of investment to affect the growth of different parts of the country. Regional distribution of resources is an important aspect of over-all efficiency in allocation. It determines the rate of growth for each particular region and hence also determines the growth of the entire nation. The present domination of the sectoral approach should be balanced by regional approach in order to quantify the geographical distribution of investment in consonance with the regional policy of off-setting existing disparity among regions. The regional spatial approach would supplement considerations of the investment sectoral mix with a corresponding locational matrix that would make more explicit the impact of specific project investment on the regional economy and would provide a clearer framework to stimulate and analyze the desirable multipher effects of sectoral investment. This implies a strong budgetary control for locating specific projects according to rigorously worked-out regional norms with respect to various inputs and production. Thus, the selection of projects should not be only from the nature of undertaking by sectors but also according to their spatial location on the basis of socio-economic benefit evaluation. Such an approach calls for careful regional analysis in order to establish those areas which need concentrated efforts to yield greater returns sooner as well as ndertakings. Once the pattern of public investment is properly established, financial and fiscal inducement or restriction can provide incentives to private investment as well. It is essential that given region for development has to be shown to contain the most vital of the complimentaries of outlay. With this approach, regional planning defines government action more clearly by helping to determine the spatial coordination of sectoralspecific areas which require assistance for productive \\tu programmes. Regional Development Programme The regional development strategy for Nepal envisages a series of north-south growth axes or development corridors linking the diverse regions. The juxtaposition of a wide range of resources (the Terai, the Hills, and Himalayas) within a common development corridor will permit economic viability and will generate greater inter-regional circulation of goods, services and people. Comprehensive regional development programmes will be initiated in the following four growth axes (Table 2) during the Fourth Plan: 1. Koshi Growth Axis: \\tBiratnagar to Hedangma 2. Gandaki Growth Axis: \\tBhairahawa to Josom 3. Karnali Growth Axis: \\tNepalgunj to Jumla 4. Kathmandu Growth Axis: \\tBirgunj to Dhunche/ Barbise The four growth axis outlined above offer the greatest prospects for the integration and coordination of the different development programmes since they present both the east-west and north- south territorial dimensions of the country. Each of the growth corridors either has a road or a road is presently being planned or constructed. These roads will link a series of growth centers where development efforts will be concentrated in order to achieve full economies of scale and to encourage agglomeration economies. Since these development corridors transverse whole gamut of regional types, the growth centers at specific locations will act as marketing and service centers for the regional population. The set of growth poles along an arterial link will induce further growth in terms of agricultural transformation, location of industries, trade activities and social services. The comprehensive development of selected growth centers will act as demonstration areas for formulating development methods best suited to other areas displaying similar conditions. Thus Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj will exemplify development patterns for the Terai towns while Dhankuta, Palung, Palpa, Syangja, and Dailekh will be models for hilly areas. In the Himalayan region Hedangma, Dhunche, Jomsom and Jumla will clarify the development procedure for the remote areas. The objective of developing growth centers is the creation of poly-functional settlements to cater to the diverse needs of the hinterland. The most important aspect of the growth center approach is the positive nature of polarized development as it takes place and the mechanisms whereby the growth center spreads growth to the surrounding area. That is through the process of multiplier effects, the areas linked to the growth center will gain from the concentrated set of economic activities. The spread effects may begin to assert themselves from these nuclei of development as the economy fully integrates itself and commodity and factor markets become more efficient. In locating such growth poles, emphasis should be given to those areas with maximum prospect for radial effects in the peripheral regions. The four development corridors linking four sets of growth centers, transect Nepal approximately 80 to 100 miles apart with the assumption that their lateral impacts will meet at a certain point in time and thus cover the entire country. Regional development is by definition a long-term problem. Though the East-West Highway provides a common link to the four growth corridors in the Terai, greater benefit will occur as the various corridors are similarly linked in the more populous hilly areas. However, the main reasoning behind the development of growth axes through regional planning is to tie-in the economy of the developing Terai with those of the hilly areas. In order to maintain and develop the economic viability of the hills and transmit growth from one region to another, it is essential to determine and initiate those activities in the northern regions for which there is demand in the southern regions. The best way to integrate the national economy is to establish the nature and scope of the complimentarity of the northern and southern part of the growth axis in terms of organic circulation in trade, labour and capital. V. POLICY FOR PROBLEM AREAS The development of growth axes offers a basic regional policy in order to articulate inner- regional economic integration in the national planning strategy. However, a development policy committed to economic growth, as well as social justice, cannot afford to wait for the development corridors to solve all the ills of the present regional disparity. There is need for concurrent programme for the amelioration of problems of special areas ranging from the depopulation of frontier or marginal regions to the over-congestion in the metropolitan districts. (a) \\tRemote Areas The mountainous part of the country has limited areas for effective utilization due to high attitude and adverse life. Most of these Himalayan districts have less than five percent of their total area under cultivation and agriculture can thus support the sparse population for only part of the year. Again, the decline of petty trading with Tibet, which was a major source of livelihood, has wrought immense economic hardships to these border people. In addition to these problems, the population residing in these areas is divorced from the mainstream of national life because of its remote location from the development centers of the country. The important pre-conditions for development of these depressed areas include increasing circulation with their southern regions through transport development and the revival of trade with the Tibetan region. The concept of the four development corridors including growth centers like Hedangma, Dhunche, Jomsom and Jumla in the Himalayan Region would further contribute to a rational policy for developing similar areas. The immediate programmes for the mountain areas should be in line with improving the transportation system and providing essential services. Some aid could be given in order to permit only emigration and training of emigrants in the skills required by expanding industries in the adjacent areas. (b) \\tMetropolitan Areas Urban areas provide another set of problems at a different level. Urbanization is an inevitable concomitant of development since urban nuclei absorb an unusually large proportion of the savings and capital funds. That the concentration of activities in the urban areas does not necessarily lead to desirable growth is well exemplified by the excessive congestion and indiscriminate spawling of metropolitan Kathmandu. Physical planning for urban areas should however be deveopled in the context of a larger regional frame -work encompassing the urban complex within Kathmandu Valley. The physical development plan for urban Kathmandu should explore into the possibility of involving more private investment. In the action programmes, priority should be given to the problems of housing and sewerage, essential services like drinking water, efficient circulation and tourist and recreational facilities in terms of immediate needs and future needs due to population growth. (c) \\tDepressed Areas Apart from the North-South (Hills vs. Terai) diversity, there are equally significant inter-regional differences between the Eastern (Kosi), Central (Gandaki), and Western (Karnali) sectors. The Karnali sector which accounts of the population. This sector is also deprived of the metropolitan advantages as of the Gandaki sector and those of periodic markets, existing in the Kosisector. The terai, as well as the Hills of the far western part of the country, are therefore, compariitively less developed than other similar areas. In order to develop the economy of the karnali sector, it will be necessary to devise another growth axis for areas not amenable to the main Nepalgunj-Jumla axis. This supplemental development corridor should be aligned along the proposed Dhangarhi-Dadeldhura Road as a means of effecting economic activities\\tto support this growth axis. 1. Introduction Six development plans have been completed in the process of all-round development of the country. Implementation of ft Sixth Plan began with the fiscal year 1980/81 ending by the close of FY 1984/85, The Seventh Plan starts from FY 1985/86. An attempt is made in the present chapter to assess the achievements and the kinds of problems faced in the implementation of the Sixth Plan. The main objective of plan evaluation is to identify the main constraints in the process of implementation of the plan so that they art not further repeated. Such a review helps identify the strengths (the successes) as well as failures in plan implementation. This helps us to identify policies and sectoral programmes that are warranted of the economy in subsequent future. The objectives of the Sixth Plan were set against the background of the principal economic problems prevailing then in the country and in consideration of the earlier constraints in plan implementation. And with the view to make development objectives mom realistic, the following objectives were set for the Sixth Plan. 1.  to attain higher growth rate in production, 2.  to increase productive employment opportunity, 3.  to fulfil minimum basic needs of the people: the followings  included for minimum basic needs, a . to make available more food grains by increasing its production b.  to make available mom fuel wood for domestic use by planned development of forests, c  to increase the supply of drinking water, d.  to extend basic health facilities and sanitation services, e.  to extend primary, vocational and adult education, f.  to extend minimum transport facilities by constructing mule trails, suspension bridges and wooden bridges. In order to attain aforementioned objectives, the following basic development policies were adopted in the Sixth Plan. 1.  to give priority to the development of the agriculture sector, 2.  to give emphasis on the development of cottage and small scale industries, 3.  to encourage the development of export trade and of tourism, 4.  to encourage the conservation of natural resources and stress on the development, of water resources, 5.  to give topmost priority to the full utilisation of the already created infrastructure 6.  to improve the absorptive capacity of the economy, and 7.  to control population growth rate. The objectives set in the Sixth Plan are long-term ones. Extensive poverty is the main problem of the economy. And increasing production is the only solution for gradual removal of prevailing poverty from the country. An attempt is made in this chapter to assess the changes that have  been brought about in the process of the implementation of set objectives and policies during the Sixth Plan. The analysis is based on actual figures of the first four years and estimates for the fifth year of the Plan period. 2. GDP, Investment and Saving Gross domestic product increased at the rate of 2.30,per.nt only during the Fifth Plan period. Against the backdrop of the existing population growth rate, the target growth rate of GDP was set at 4.3 percent during the Sixth Plan. In order to attain this growth rate, targets were set to increase agricultural production by 3.20 percent and that of the non-agricultural sector by 5.60 percent. As population growth rate was assumed at 2. 30 percent, per capita income was assumed to increase at 2.00 percent annually. While GDP decreased during FY 1979/80 due to adverse weather conditions, it increased abnormally by 8.30 percent in FY 1980/81 i.e. the first year of the Sixth Plan, It increased again by 3.80 percent in FY 1981/82. M FY 1982/83, them was a decline in total production by 1.4% due to fall in agriculture production because of drought. In FY 1983/84, weather conditions improved and national product increased by,7.40 percent. In the last year of the Sixth Plan period i.e. FY 1984/85 weather condition remained normal and GDP is expected to increase by 4.00 percent. Thus the average growth rate of national, product in the Sixth. Plan has been estimated to be 4.40 percent. During this period, growth rate of the agricultural sector has been estimated at 4.70 percent and that for non-agricultural sector at 4.00 percent. Against the growth rate of population by 2.66 per cent, per capita is estimated to have increased by 1.70 percent. Total population is expected to be 16.686 million by mid-July 1985 as against 14.633 million in mid-July 1980. It is clear from the foregoing explanations that the agriculture sector has a major role to play for the increase of overall GDP. And even until now, agricultural production depends mainly on weather. Because irrigation facilities are not yet available on an extensive scale, improved method of cultivation has remained limited, resulting in low agricultural production. Looking at the structure of GDP, it could be observed that substantial change has taken place in the pattern of  the economy., Table 1.2 shows that the economy is still heavily dependent on agriculture. Since there was no progress in the non-agricultural sector as expected, no meaningful change has taken place in the structure, of the economy. The production of major foodgrains and cash crops was expected to increase annually by 2.80 percent and 3.00 percent respectively during the Plan period, resulting in the growth of overall production at 3.00 % annually daring the Sixth Plan. 60 percent annually while that of foodgrains decreased by 2.80 percent. This resulted in a decrease of 2.00 % annually in the total production of major crops. In the final year of the Fifth Plan, i.e., FY 1979/80, production of foodgrains decreased by 12.90 percent  and that of cash crops by 8.20 percent due to adverse weather, resulting in the decline in overall production of major crops by 12.10 percent. Because of favourable weather conditions, there was an increase in the production of foodgrains by 18.30 percent and that of cash crops by 5.30 percent, resulting exceptionally in an increase in the total production of major crops by 15.70 percent. Except barely in foodgrain and tobacco, jute and potato in cash crops, all the major crops recorded an increase in production in the same year. In the following years the production 6f foodgrains and cash crops recorded an increase except for foodgrains in 1982/83 and cash crops in 1983/84. During the Plan period, total production of all major crops is expected to increase by 5.90 percent annually as  result of the increase in foodgrains production by 6.20 percent and cash crops by 4.30 percent. The target of the Plan  has been exceeded because of the exceptional increase in production in the FY 1980/81. The main causes for the decrease in production of jute during the period under review are the failing in prices of jute in the international market and the lack of remunerative prices for the jute-growers. Even then the increase of production of cash crops has exceeded the target. During the Sixth Plan, except in FY 1982/83 and FY 1984/85, production of foodgrains exceeded the target of the annual increase of-2.80 percent for all years. In the FY 1982/83, foodgrain production declined by 10.20 percent because of late monsoons and inadequate precipitation. As production could increase considerably in FY 1983/84 as it did in FY 1980/81 because of decline in production in the preceding year. Production of cash crops is estimated to increase by4.30 percent annually, exceeding the set target. Production of cash crop declined only by 3.70 percent because of the unexpected decline in tin production of jute and sugarcane. In the FY 1984/85 the production of cash crops is estimated to increase compared with the preceding years. Production statistics of cottage industries are not available. Thus the average growth rate of industrial production during the Plan period is estimated to be 10.30 percent. The growth rate attained during the Sixth Plan period can, therefore, be considered encouraging compared with the 7.30 percent growth rate of industrial production during the Fifth Plan period. The improvement in supply of power with the completion of Kulekhani hydro power project in FY 1981 and Devighat project in FY 1983, seems to have helped in the smooth operation of industries. Favourable environment for the remaining of industries was possible because of lesser incidence of labour problems during these v years. During the, period under review, soap, synthetic textiles, cotton textiles, cigarettes, liquor and agriculture tools  -registered an appreciable growth among industrial products. On amount of the restrictions in the imp ort of soaps, the production of soaps increased four fold due to adequate domestic market. Due to unfavourable balance of payments situation, the issue of import licence for synthetic textiles from overseas was restricted in FY 1982/83. Consequently the synthetic industries increased their production substantially, that year. Among the industrial goods, production of plywood (whom production was increasing upto 1981/82) went down since 1982/83. The production of stainless steel utensils (whom production went down till 1982/83) has started increasing thereafter. 5. Investment, Savings and Consumption GDP, development expenditure of Rs 33:.44 billion (out of which Rs 25. 75 billion would be in fixed capital formation) at constant prices of 1979/80 was, envisaged as necessary. The above investment requirement is based on ICOR of 4.50: 1.00. Out of the total investment it was envisaged that public sector investment would be Rs 12.30 billion with. Rs 13.45 billion in the private sector. Thus it was envisaged that investment (at Rs 25.75 billion in fixed capital formation) would be 18.50 percent of gross domestic product. Of this 8.80 percent would be in the public sector and 9.70 percent in the private sector. For this, total investment needed to increase at an annual growth rate of 16.00 percent, public sector investment at 19.40 percent and private sector investment at 13.30 percent. In order to attain the target growth rate of investment, it was envisaged that national savings should increase at the annual rate of 6.50 percent and be 7.7 percent of GDP The pattern of national savings and investment at current prices during the Sixth Plan period is presented in the Table 1. 7. In the fiscal year 1979/80 about 61.0 percent of total investment was borne by national savings and the balance by foreign savings. And clearly, the dependence of the economy on foreign savings is increasing for sustaining increased level of investment. Investment stood at 18. 30 percent of GDP in FY 1979/80 and is estimated to reach 18.80 percent in FY 1984/85. Although the annual growth rate of national savings stood at 11. 20 percent its sham in GDP is expected to drop from 10.90 percent to 10.40 percent. Consumption is estimated to have increased by 12.70 percent annually. Its share in GDP in FY 1979/80 stood at 88.90 percent, and is expected to increase to 89.60 percent in FY 1984/85. As a whole it has not been possible to achieve substantial progress in mobilizing savings during the Sixth Plan period. Only 9.60 percent of the additional income could be mobilized as additional savings. During this period, it was possible to mobilize as saving only 9.60 percent of additional income generated. 6. Financial Situation of Gove rnment It was envisaged that in order to achieve the 4.30.pereent targeted annual growth rate of GDP, public  sector development expenditure at constant prices of FY 1979/80 should be Rs 21.75 billion. In order to maintain the desired level of development expenditures, the annual growth rate of the regular expenditure needed to be limited to 10.00 percent, increase government revenue by 12.00 percent and foreign aid by 23.20 percent on annual basis. Substantial progress could not be attained in the mobilisation of revenue during the Plan period. In the first year of the Plan period, i. e. FY 1980/81 revenue increased remarkably by 29. Because of adverse weather in the previous year, i. e. FY 1979/80, when revenue stood minimal, increase in revenue in FY 1980/81 was more exceptional. FY 1981/82, additional increase in the revenue by I L 50 percent was recorded. But in the third year i. e. FY 1982/83, because there was a decline in total production, revenue could increase only by 5.90 percent. Revenue is estimated to have increased by 20.10 percent in FY 1983/84 and by 13.60 percent in FY1984/85. Thus the growth rate of revenue in the Plan period is estimated to be 15. 80 percent at current prices. However, on the, basis of constant prices of FY 1979/80, this annual growth rate turns out to be only 5.10 percent. Thus, total revenue at constant prices of FY 1970-80 -reaches Rs 10. 0 % of the target of Rs 13. 93 billion for the Sixth Plan period (Table 1. 9) and (Table 1. 10) During the plan period it is estimated that tax revenue would increase to s. 3.0991 billion from R~. 1.5288  billion at the annual growth rate of 15.20 percent. Non-tax revenue is estimated to increase to Rs 770.9 million from 330.90 million at the rat: of 18.40 percent. The annual growth rate of direct taxes is estimated at 20.40 percent and that of indirect taxes at 14 .00 percent, Thus direct tax revenue is estimated to reach Rs 643.20 million and indirect tax revenue to Rs 2.4559 billion in FY 1984/85. Income tax, sales tax , property registration tax and excise duty show fastest growth rate. Export duties on several commodities have been dropped or reduced in order to encourage exports. This has led to a decline in revenue from export. Revenue from land tax also has declined bemuse of concessions accorded in land tax. In the non-tax area, revenue from forest has gone down because export of timber has been restricted for forest conservation. Revenue from dividends and interest has increased remarkably. Increase of the import licence fees helped in increasing revenue from non-tax sources since 1983/84. During the period under review steps undertaken for resource mlibilization were limited to raising existing rates. Rates of customs duty, excis e sales tax, excise duty etc. in indirect tax were increased. In direct taxes, tax rates on urban property tax, income tax and registration tax, were raised. Rates of other minor taxes, such as import hotel tax, import embarkation tax, passport and visa fees were also raised. New taxes such as road and bridge maintenance tax, and building construction tax were introduced. Road and bridge taxes, introduced in FY 1982/83, were in FY 1984/85. The basis of some excise duties was changed from quantity to advalorem. Including house rent tax, 2 Urban house & land tax, vehicle tax, tax on loan and interest 3 Including refund of Indian excise duty, 4 entertainment tax, road cess, hotel tax, Embarkation tax, contract tax and other income in customs, 5 Mint income not included, 6 Nepal Rastra Bank, 7 Estimate  Specific steps such as strengthening of the tax administration, improve- of procedures for tax collection, prevention of tax leakage, location and identification of tax evaders, etc. were not taken to solve the basic, problem of tax collection nor attempt was made to mobilize additional resources in agriculture sector. Steps whatsoever were not taken for increasing revenue collection by improving the operation of the government-owned industrial and commercial organizations. In the absence of these efforts, the possibility of increasing the revenue only by increasing the existing rate has increasingly narrowed down. Regular expenditure has been increasing at the rate of 21.40 percent annually during the Plan period. Major share of,  regular expenditure is accounted by other expenditure, defense and internal security. Other expenditure shares 31.00 percent and defense and internal security 26.00 percent respectively in the total increase in regular expenditures. The main reason for the extraordinary increase in other expenditure is the increase in salary and other facilities of the employees since 1980/81 and especially, the late Increase in salary level in 1984/85. Regular, expenditure under the heading of social and other economic services has increased by 18.00 percent only. These -social and economic services hue been receiving less priority in financial appropriate since a few years. This has resulted in under utilization of capital assets due to lack of proper maintenance. During this period, about 25.00 percent of regular expenditure was spent on payment of principal and interest. Of the total targeted development expenditure, 30.40 percent was allocated to agriculture, irrigation and forest, 25.00 percent to industry, mining and electricity, 19.40 percent to transport and communication, 23.70 percent to social services, and 0.70 percent for miscellaneous. Expenditure target was achieved in none of the heading under development expenditure except under the miscellaneous. Expenditure on agriculture, irrigation and forest, and industry, mining and electricity attained 66.00 percent and 60.40 percent of the target respectively. In transport and communication, and social services, they stood at 71.10 percent and 86.00 percent respectively. But it seems to have increased up to 53.20 percent. This change has adversely affected the balance of payment and price stabilisation objectives of the Plan. Foreign aid at current prices increased by 20.00 percent per annum during the Plan period. While 61.00 of the development Expenditure was targeted to be met by foreign aid (gross), 50.90 percent was actually so met. Non-availbility of the foreign aid is not the cause of this under-utilisation of foreign aid. Slow and ineffective execution of foreign aided projects - the main muse for this under-utilization of already committed foreign aid. A seemingly incongruous situation is observed with both resorting to deficit finance in meeting expenditure on the one hand and under-utilization of available foreign aid on the other. 7. Monetary and Credit Situation It was aimed that the growth of money supply would be limited within the rate of 12.00 percent per annum in order to contain inflation within a predetermined range and to maintain equlibrium in the balance of payment situation in the Sixth Plan. In this process, it laid emphasis on the utilisation of the credit monitoring instruments available with Nepal Rastra Bank and keeping the deficit finance within narrow limits. The rate of growth of money supply in the first, second and fourth years of the Plan followed mom or less the set targets respectively. In these years, money supply increased by 13.30 percent (Rs 0.3774 billion), 12.60 percent (Rs 0.4037 billion) and 13.40 percent (Rs, 0.15826 billion) respectively. But in the third year of the Plan, money supply increased substantially by 20.40 percent (Rs 0.7374 billion). Money supply is estimated to increase by 12.40 percent (Rs 0.6226 billion) in the final year of the Plan i. e. FY 1984/85. Thus, the average rate of increase of money supply is estimated to reach 14-40 percent in the Plan, superseding the set target. His Majesty\\'s Government started borrowing heavily from the banking sector from the second year of Plan, Borrowings by His Majesty\\'s Government that, year increased by 63 percent over the previous year. In the third year, it increased still more by 98.00 percent. Thus borrowing by His Majesty\\'s Government increased by 36.00 perce t on average during the five years. During the five year period under review, borrowings by public corporations increased yearly by 7. 10 % only. Such borrowing increased remarkably in the first and third years of the Plan but it declined in the second and fourth years, and is estimated decrease further in the fifth year. Credit to the private sector in the first year increased by 30.00 percent. In the second and third years credit against foodgrains was controIled with a view to deal with foodgrain shortage and so, borrowings by the private sector could not increase. In the fourth year borrowings by the private sector increased by 10.00 percent in FY 1983/84 as the economy was set in motion with the increase in GDP restriction on credit against foodgrains was relaxed and special programms for export promotion were executed. It is estimated that in FY 1984/85 credit to the private sector will  increase by 18.00 percent. 00 percent (Rs 4. 67 billion) was disbursed, to His Majesty\\'s Government, 7.00 percent (Rs 0.46 bill a) to public io corporations and 26.00 percent (Rs 1.84 billion) to the private sector. Bemuse of substantial increase in credit to His Majesty\\'s Government, there has been a remarkable change in pattern of internal loan within the .five years. Internal borrowings by His Majesty\\'s Government are expected to increase by 53.00 percent in 1985 compared with 29.00 percent in 1980. If borrowings by public corporations are included in the government sector, the proportion would reach 67.00 percent by the middle of July 1985.  during the p1an period, the actual increase was only Rs 0.0386 billion because the bala1ance of Rs 0.4599 billion was simply due to, profit accrued out of currency devaluation and changes in exchange rates. In the first year it increased by 8.00 percent (Rs 0.1926 billion), in the second year by 21.00, percent (Rs 0.5015 billion). But in the third year, there was a decline in net foreign assets by 22 percent (Rs 0.6750 billion) because of adverse balance of payment. In the fourth year also, there was a decline by 5.00 percent (Rs 0.1264 billion). In the fifth year it is estimated to increase by 6.00 percent (Rs 0.1559 billion). In totality, net foreign assets had no substantial influence in the expansion of the money supply. Constant increase in the time deposit had prominent reason in the contraction in money supply during the period  under review. Increase in time deposit was 26.00 percent (Rs 0.6450 billion) in the first year, at 24.00 percent (Rs 0.7466 billion) in the second year, at 27.00 percent (Rs 1.0270 billion) in the third year, at 13.00 percent (Rs 0. 6502 billion) in the fourth year and 18.00 percent (Rs 1.0000 billion) in the fifth year respective1y. Another factor with contractionary effect in money supply, capital and net unclassified liability is estimated to increase by, 3.30, percent per annum (Rs 0.2194 billion). The main feature of the credit extension by commercial banks during the second and the third years of the Plan period is the diversion of credit from the private sector to the public sector. Credit to the private sector was controlled in order to meet the growing deficit of government finance. In FY 1980/81, banks expanded additional credit by Rs 9.7588 billion (23.90 percent). Out of which 75.00 percent (Rs 0.5687) was made available to the private sector. In FY 1981/82, additional credit was extended Rs0.2953 billion (7.50 percent) out of which 47 percent (Rs0.1400 billion) was available to the private sector. In FY 1982/83, additional credit expanded by Rs 0.9291 billion (22.00 percent) out of which 6.30 percent (Rs0.0585 billion) went to the private sector. There was substantial contraction in credit to the private sector because of steps taken in credit control in order to meet increasing credit needs of the public sector and meet the adverse balance of payment in FY 1982/83. But from FY 1983/84, because of relaxation in credit control, banks were active again in meeting credit requirement of the private sector. In that year, there was additional credit expansion by Rs 0.7181 billion (12.00 percent). Of this, Rs  0.4444 billion (62.00 percent) was made available to the private sector. In the final year of the Plan i. e. FY 1984/85, additional increase of Rs 0.9274 billion (16.00 percent) in credit by banks is estimated of which 70.00 percent (Rs0.6474 billion) is expected to flow to the private sector. The proportion of the private sector share in total loan and investment was 59.00 percent in July 1980. It went up to 62.00 percent in July 1981 and declined to 51.00 percent in July 1982. Some improvement took place in this proportion since 1983/84, reaching 53.00 percent in July 1984 and is estimated to reach 56.00 percent by July 1985. Deposits with the commercial banks increased substantially during the period under review. The deposit increased by Rs 0.8135 billion (24.00 percent), Rs 0.7638 billion (18.00 percent), Rs 1.3795 billion (28.00 percent), and Rs 0.7805 (12.00 percent) in the first year, second year, third year and fourth year respectively. In the fifth year it estimated to increase by Rs 1.3454 billion (19.00 percent) Table 1.20. Thus the deposits with the commercial banks are expected to reach Rs 8.4124 billion by mid-July 1985 at the growth rate of 20.40 percent per annum. Of the total deposit of Rs 5.0827 billion with the commercial banks the proportion of the savings and fixed deposits comes to 73 percent or Rs 3.6963 billion. Savings deposit has grown at the annual rate of 23.00 percent and fixed deposit at 20.00 percent during this period. Attractive interest rate and extension of branches of the commercial banks have led to the fast growth of savings and fixed deposits. The reforms of the interest rates in April 1976 brought about a remarkable change in the composition of deposits with the commercial banks. In mid-July 1976, the share of saving and fixed deposits in the total deposit was 59 % only. This increased to 72 percent in mid-July 1980 in five years. In mid-July 1985, saving and fixed deposits are expected to reach Rs 6.0824, i. e. 72 percent of the total deposit. Though saving deposit grew at a fast rate, the growth rate of fixed deposit declined suddenly since 1983/84. The cause for this decline is that saving of non-financial corporations and personal saving were increasingly invested in development bonds bearing 13.00 percent interest and the shares floated by the private companies. The dependence of commercial banks on the Nepal Rastra Bank decreased because of substantial increase in deposits with them during the Plan period. An integrated banking programme was launched from mid-October 1980 with a view to financing projects under priority sector under regional basis. Special attention is given to the feasibility and supervisory aspects of the projects financed under this programme and a policy of financing individuals without mortagable assets against collective security has been adopted. Additionally, 60.00 percent of the total loan under this priority sector is provided to small families. In the initial years of the Sixth Plan, it was made obligatory to the commercial banks to finance minimum of 7.00 percent of the total deposit liability the projects under the priority sector. This proportion was raised to 10.00 percent in FY 1982/83 and the same was maintained in FY 1983/84. In order to launch this credit programme under the priority sector in an integrate manner, a committee by the name of Priority sector Coordination Committee was established with representation from concerned institutions. Presently, integrates banking programmes are implemented through 133 branches. In the first four years of the Plan, commercial banks invested additional, Rs 0.1262. billion in priority sector projects. Out of this, agriculture sector received Rs 0.0581 billion and cottage industry sector Rs 0.0830 billion. In the service sector, investment went down by Rs 0.0149 billion. In FY 1984/85 it is aimed to invest additional Rs 0.2538 billion in priority sector projects. A special programme was launched from FY 1982/83 in 9 districts three in   and six in  for making financial assistance available to the cottage and small scale industries through commercial banks. The policy adopted under this programme is to give more importance to the feasibility of the project and seriousness of the industrialist than collateral for. By the end of FY 1983/84, loans amounting to Rs 46.40 billion were disbursed under this programmes. This helped establish 1,413 small-scale industries creating employment opportunities for 13,678 persons. It is estimated that the banks will disburse additional Rs 75.00 million for the development of small-scale industries in FY 1984/85. By mid-July 1980, the commercial banks had 241 branches and one branch covered 60 thousand persons. In the  first four years of the Sixth Plan, additional 115 new branches were opened. Agricultural Development Bank was permitted to start banking transactions with a separate branch in . A new bank by the name of Nepal Arab Bank was established under joint collaboration by the Nepalese and foreigners. Thus by the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, there were 351 branches of commercial banks with banking transactions, In FY 1984/85 Agricultural Development Bank has been permitted to conduct general, banking transactions through its 23 branches and it is estimated that the commercial banks will open additional 30 branches by mid-July 1985. This amounts to 411 branches, which will conduct banking transitions, one branch covering 41,000 persons. Nepal Rastra Bank initiated various monetary policy measures in order to control the flow and composition of  the loans made available by the commercial banks. In FY 1981/82 with the new arrangement regarding the requirement of liquidity by the commercial banks should maintain liquidity to the extent of 25 % of total deposit of this liquidity of 4 % is to be in cash in hand, 5 % deposit at Nepal Rastra Bank. Interest rate for saving and fixed deposits was increased by 0.50 percent and that for the loans by 1.00 percent from mid-July 1982. Loans against mortgage of foodgrains were not permitted because of foodgrain shortages due to unfavourable weather conditions in 1982/83. In order to rectify the unfavourable balance of payment at the close of that year, 100.00 % margin was fixed for the import of luxurious and semi-luxurious goods from the countries other than , and from mid-July 1983 complete restriction was imposed on the latter of credit from import. But in FY 1983/84 some steps were taken in relaxing the controls in the credit administration providing pre-export credit at the subsidized interest rates. The target set for the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation was to finance Rs502.70 million, including investment in equity, and for the Agricultural Development Bank to finance (gross) Rs 1744.10 million on industry and agriculture sectors during the Sixth Plan. In the first year, i.e, 1980/81, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation increased the annual loan dis bursement by 77 percent (Rs 46.10 million). In the second year it went down by 24.00 percent to Rs 35.10 million. The corporation expects to disburse Rs 80.00 million in the final year (FY 1984/85) of the Plan. Thus, the corporation will be investing Rs 284.30 million in loans, which will be 57.00 percent of the target in the Sixth Plan. In case of Agricultural Development Bank, annual disbursement went down by 9.00 percent in FY 1980/81 to Rs 134.10 million. But in the second, third and fourth years its loan disbursement increased to Rs 256.50 million, Rs 345.80 million and Rs . Thus, the Agricultural Development Bank fulfilled 100% of the target by disbursing a total of Rs 1740.80 million during the Plan period (Table 1.21.) The increase in the number of small farmer development projects operated by the Agricultural Development  Bank is encouraging. In FY 1979/80, the number of small farmer development projects was 29 only. In FY 1983/84 this number increased to 121. In these projects 29,293 small farmer members and 3,013 groups were involved. In FY 1984/85, it was estimated that additional 39 will start, thereby increasing the total number of projects to 160. Agricultural Development Bank invested Rs 57.50 million .in these projects in. the first four years of the Plan and with additional loan disbursement of Rs 50.70 million in the final year, the total loan dis bursement will reach Rs 108.20 million in the Sixth Plan. Attention  was paid on the integration and consolidation of the established organizations rather than on establishment of new ones. In FY 1979/80, there were 711 cooperative organizations. In the first four years of the Plan period 56, cooperatives were established. In FY 1983/84, there was no increase in number because of the reorganization of the existing ones. In FY1979780, the strength of these organizations was 1.194. million member which reached 1.393 million with an increase by 17 percent. The cooperative organizations made loans available amounting to Rs 121.50 million as of mid-July 1980 which reached Rs 201.20 million by mid-July 1984 at an annual growth rate of 13.40 percent. In 1984/85 it is estimated that additional 13 cooperatives would be established. In the first four years of the Plan period Employees Provident Fund increased its investment in equity and loan substantially, with diversification in the composition of investment. The Fund had expanded its investment by Rs 925.30 million - Rs 639.90 million in equity and Rs 285.40 million in loan disbursement. This investment has been possible because of the remarkable increase of the financial resources of the fund, which increased by Rs 942.40 million. One reason for this increase is the beginning provident fund deduction by the educational institutions and some government agencies. The composition of the investment and loan has changed since 1983/84. The principal sector of the investment by the fund was in fixed deposit at the commercial banks in the first three years of the Plan from the fourth year, investment in development bonds increased substantial. National Insurance Corporation The role of National Insurance Corporation had become wider in mobilizing insurance premium for use in development activities during the Sixth Plan period. In the first four years of the Plan period the resource of the corporation increased by Rs 104.80 million. During this period, the corporation increased investment and loan by Rs 86.00 million of which was invested development bonds. In FY 1984/85, the corporation is expected to increase loans and investment by Rs 49.00 million. In the Fifth Plan period, Postal saving bank services was initiated as a new institutional arrangement for collecting savings. Under this service savings account can be opened with a minimum of Rs 5.00 and with a maximum deposit ceiling Rs 30,000.00. Upto FY 1979/80, 25 district post offices provided this service. Credit Guarantee Corporation This corporation is authorized to guarantee credits upto Rs 0.20 million for agriculture and other service sector under the priority sector from the commercial banks and upto Rs 1.00 million for industry. In FY 1979/80, the Corporation guaranteed credit worth Rs 79.70 million, and this guarantee is expected to go up to Rs 122.50 million by  FY 1984/85. As the capital asset of this corporation has not been able to increase adequately, it has not been able to expand its activities according needs. 8. Price Situation Excessive pressure was felt in the price situation in the country during the Sixth Plan period. In the first three years, price rose at the rate of 12.70 percent per annum and in the fourth year it stayed at 6.2 percent. In the final year (1984/85) it is estimated to go up by 7 percent. Thus the annual average price rise is expected to be 10.20 percent during the Plan period. According to the national urban consumer price index, the overall prices recorded an increase by 13.40  percent in FY 1980/81 with prices of food and beverages increasing by 13.40 percent and of other goods and services by 13.30 percent. As production of foodgrains was good this year, with the fall in the growth of price rise in rice, its price index increased by only 6.40 percent. But of sugar and sweets, restaurant meals, oil and ghee increased by 63.40 percent and 66.00 percent respectively. The prices of pulses, meat, fish, and eggs increased by 18 percent and of milk and milk products and beverages by more than 10.00 percent. The price of the food and beverage group increased by more than 13 percent because of high increase of the prices of the food items. Among the non-food items and service, the price of cloth and tailoring, medicines and health care and cigarettes increased by 6-7 percent only but that of footwear, fuel lamps and water, transport and communication and education and recreation increased by 10.00 percent. The price increase of food and beverages dropped to 11.00 percent and that other goods and services to 9.40 percent. Rice, vegeTables, spices and milk and milk products are the ones among all food and beverages group which have recorded a high price rise. The prices of meat, fish and eggs and sugar and sweets went down. Among other goods and services group, cloth, tailoring, fuel, lamp and water are the ones, which have recorded a 10-11 percent price rise. Third year (1982/83): The price increased by 14.20 percent. Because of reduction of the foodgrain production,  the prices of food and beverages went up by 16 percent and of other goods and services by 10.60 percent. Among food and beverage, rice recorded a price rise of 35 percent, grain and grain products 33 percent, meat, fish and eggs 21 percent, spices 15 percent, milk and milk products 13 percent, and beverages 17 percent. Among other goods and services, fuel, lamps and water recorded a price rise of 19 percent, cigarettes by 10 percent, education and recreation by 9 percent and footwear by 8 percent respectively. Fourth year (1983/84): The overall price increase was 6 percent when food and beverages prices recorded an increase by 5.20 percent and other goods and services by 8.50 percent respectively. This year witnessed a good crop resulting in an improved price situation, compared to the previous year. The price of foodgrains and foodgrain products went down by 10.40 percent and of sugar & sweets by 2.50 percent; but vegeTables recorded a 16 percent price rise and meat, fish and eggs 17 percent. Among other goods and services cloth and tailoring increased by 8 percent, of footwear by 7 percent, housing by 11 percent and education and recreation by 3 percent respectively. Final year (1984/85): The price is estimated to increase by 7 percent. Thus the average annual price rise during the Plan period works out to be 10.00 percent. Except for the fourth and the fifth years, there has been an immense pressure on the price situation during the Plan period. During the period under review, the internal factors affecting the price rise are, a) poor agriculture crop in the base year 1979/80 and the third year 1982/83, b) price increase in other goods and services provided by the government corporation, c) frequent increase in the rates of the import duty, sales tax and excise duty and d) increase in money supply for because of excessive dependence on deficit finance by the government. The international monetary situation in general and fast price rise in  in particular are the external factors affecting the price situation. 9. Foreign Trade and Balance of Payment During the Sixth Plan period, the growth in exports is expected to be 13.5 % and that of annual imports at 16.9 %, leading to the growth in trade imbalance by 17.97 %. Because of import restrictions, overseas trade imbalance has decreased. Yet the ever-widening unfavourab1e balance of payment with  has become a subject for serious concern. During the first three years of the Sixth Plan period, trade imbalance deteriorated further. During these years, exports went down and the economy had to face a huge trade deficit because of increasing imports and decreasing exports. In the first year (FY 1980/81), because of favourable weather conditions, agricultural production increased extraordinarily compared to the minimal level attained in the previous year, FY 1980/81. But, in the second year (FY 1981/82), the exports decreased by 7.30  percent to the level of Rs 1491.50 million. In the following year (FY 1982/83), there was still further fall in exports by 24. 10 percent, decreasing to the level of Rs 1132.00 million. Exports dropped extraordinarily because of fall in agricultural production, due mainly to drought that year and also the prohibition of export of foodgrains and timber. Overseas export of Rs 609.60 million in FY 1979/80 dropped by 2.1 percent to Rs 616.30 million in FY 1980/81. In 1892/83, because of various measures taken by His Majesty\\'s Government under a 9-point programme, there was remarkable boost in exports by 50.50 percent and hit an all-time high record of Rs 1703.90 million export to India reached Rs 1160.70 million with an increase by 37.70 percent and to overseas countries Rs 543.20 million with an increase by 88.10 percent. In the FY 1984/85, exports is estimated to reach Rs 2160.00 million with a 26.80 percent increase (Table 1.26). Import has been increasing at an accelerated rate. It increased by 27.30 percent in 1980/81, by 11.30 percent in 1981/82 and by 28.10 reaching Rs . 6314.00 million in 1982/83. In all these years, imports from overseas countries increased more than from . Because of deterioration balance of payment situation with overseas countries. imports were restriction from other countries. So overall imports increased only by 3.2 percent reaching Rs 6510.00 million in 1983/84. Imports from the overseas countries dropped to Rs 3456.30 million by 9.40 percent that year. In 1984/85, imports are expected to increase by 14.70% reaching Rs 7470.00 million. As the restriction or imports from overseas are still in force, no substantial increase in imports is anticipated from overseas countries. However, substantial increase in imports from  is anticipated. Because of the falling exports and rising imports the overall trade deficit of Rs 2329.60 million in 1979/80  doubled to Rs 5182.00 in 1982/83. During this period, trade deficit with overseas countries shot up to Rs 3525.60  million from Rs 1064.10 million. However with , the increase was from Rs 1265.50 to Rs 1656.40 million. In 1983/84, exports increased substantially and increase in imports was marginal. So, trade deficit could be contained at Rs 4810.40 million in that year. In FY 1984/85, it is estimated that the trade deficit will reach Rs 5310.00 million with an annual increase by 10.00 percent. Analysis of the structure of trade during these years reveals that there has not been noTable change in the  composition of export and imports. If food and raw material showed prominence in exports, industrial goods was prominent in imports. The volume export is observed to fluctuate along the changes in weather conditions and foodgrain export policy and its share was 61. 00 percent in 1983/84. Although there is some increase in the export of industrial goods, new exporTable product has not emerged. As jute and Jute goods could not fetch attractive prices in the overseas market, their export has been directed to . Woolen carpet alone has appeared as the main exporTable commodity that could survive overseas market without any financial or foreign exchange subsidy. In the case of imports the proportion of industrial goods was 72.0% in 1979/80 and has remained so in 1983/84 also. During this period, as the proportion of food and raw materials has remained at 28.0 percent of the total imports, there seems to be ample possibility of import substitution in the agricultural sector too. Analysis of the statistics of balance of payment reveals that, though current account losses increased with the trade losses in the first two years, balance of payment situation remained favourable because of increasing foreign aid. 1982/83, foreign aid could not compensate for the big trade deficit. So, foreign reserve had to be used to meet its deficit. In 1983/84, because of the improvement of the current account balance, balance of payment deficit decreased. First year (1980(81): Though the trade deficit increased by 18 percent to Rs 2.83 billion yet because of increase in net services income by 28.00 percent and net transfer income by 30.00 percent, current account loss increased by only 5.00 percentage to Rs 1.16 billion. That year though capital outflow stood at Rs 140.00 million, there was favourable overall balance of payment situation with a positive balance of Rs 190.00 million because of an inflow of Rs 149 billion in foreign aid. Second year (FY 1981(82): Trade deficit increased by 22 percent and reached Rs 3.45 billion. Net transfer income dropped by 6 percent. But income from services increased by 23.00 percent. Current account deficit went up to Rs 1.55 billion at the rate of 34.00 percent because income from services and net transfer incomes could not offset the trade deficit. Because of the inflow of Rs 1.93 billion in foreign aid and capital inflow by Rs 120.00 million, there was an overall surplus of Rs 500.00 million in balance of payment. On the other, import increased excessively leading to the increase in trade deficit by 5.10 percent. Though income from services and net transfer increased by 19 percent and l0 percent respectively, current account loss doubled to reach Rs 2.99 billion because trade deficit shot up. Inflow of foreign aid of Rs 2.24 billion and capital by Rs 70.00 million were inadequate to compensate this deficit. So the overall balance of payment deficit stood at Rs 680.00 million. After many years, the country had to experience this kind of difficult situation again. Fourth year (FYI983/84): Improvement in the exp ort front and minimal increase in imports led to a decrease in trade deficit by 7.00 percent to the level of Rs 4.80 billion. Though income from services dropped by 12.00 percent because of the drop in income from tourism, net transfer income increased by 20.00 percent, leading to a decrease by l0 % in current account deficit to the level of Rs 2.70 billlion. Even though the inflow of foreign aid was Rs 2.79 billion, the overall balance of payment deficit stood at Rs 130.00 million because of the outflow of capital by an extent of Rs 220.00 million. Fifth year (FY 1984/85): The trade deficit is expected to reach Rs 5.31 billion this year with total export of Rs  2. Net income from services is estimated to increase by 20.00 percent and transfer income by 8.00 percent to reach the level of Rs 740.00 million. Though current account deficit is expected to increase by 5 % to the level of Rs 2.84 billion, an estimated inflow of foreign aid to the extent of Rs 3.25 billion is expected to lead to a balance of payment surplus of Rs 160.00 million, in spite of the estimated capital outflow of Rs 260.00 million. During the period under review, different patterns in the balance of payment situation vis -a-vis  and overseas are noted. During the Fifth Plan period (1975-80), balance of payment with  deteriorated significantly. A total of Rs 2.32 billion worth of foreign exchange had to be sold to purchase Indian currency in order to meet the trade deficit. In the first year of the Sixth Plan too, there was a balance-of payment deficit of Rs 70.00 million. But in the second and the third years, there was a balance-of-payment surplus of Rs 340.00 million and Rs 210.00 million respectively with . There was balance-of payment surplus of Rs 260.00 million and Rs 160.00 million in the first and the second years respectively with overseas countries. But in the third year, a balance-of- payment deficit of Rs 880.00 million was recorded. In the fourth year, the balance of payment with these countries improved and there was a surplus of Rs 230.00 million (Table 1.29) 4  Estimate. Changes in the balance of payment greatly effect the foreign exchange holdings of the Nepal Rastra Bank. In  the first and second years of the Plan period, as the overall balance of payment was favourable, foreign exchange holding increased by 5.00 percent and 24.00 percent respectively. In the first year (1980/8l), though the overall balance of payment remained favourable, the unfavourable balance of payment with India from the beginning of the Fifth Plan continued, and Rs 615.00 million worth of foreign exchange had to be sold in order to purchase Indian currency, In the third year (1982/83) as the balance of payment with overseas countries remained extremely unfavourable. There was a drop of Rs 1.14 billion in convertible foreign exchange holdings. Balance of payment with  improved and there was an increase of Rs 270.00 million in inconvertible foreign exchange holdings that year. Thus, the foreign exchange holding dropped by 28.0 % i.e. by Rs860.00 million. In the fourth year (1983/84), though there was some improvement in the convertible foreign exchange holdings, there was a sharp drop in the inconvertible foreign exchange holding, leading to a drop in overall foreign exchange holdings by Rs 490.00 million, or by 18.00 percent. By mid-July 1984, foreign exchange holdings (Rs 2.0062 billion) of the Nepal Rastra Bank could meet the import requirements of 3.5 months only whereas the foreign exchange holdings of the Nepal Rastra Bank in mid-July 1980 could meet imports of 7.5 months. During the period under review serious changes took place in the balance of payment situation of the country (Table 1.30). On September 19, 1981 the unified exchange rate was raised to Rs 13.20 from the first rate of Rs 12.00 for each U.S. dollar by devaluation by 10.00 percent on December 17, 1982. The exchange rate was raised to Rs 14.30 from Rs 13.20 for each U.S. dollar by devaluating the rate by 8.00 percent. On June 1, 1983 currency basket system was adopted in the determination of exchange rates. Exchange rate was raised to Rs 14.50 from Rs 14.30 for each U.S. dollar by a devaluation of 1.00 percent. During this period, no change in the exchange rate with Indian currency was effected. From June 1, 1983, daily exchange rates of convertible foreign exchange was determined on the basis of currency basket system. Construction and Development materials and Supply Situation of Technical Manpower Supply Situation of Construction Materials The total consumption of cement is estimated to be 1,515,200 metric tons with 1,090,000 metric tons of actual consumption in the first four years and an estimated consumption of 425,200 metric tons in 1984/85 at the end of the Plan period, which is 89.90 percent of the estimated total plan requirements of 1,742,600 metric tons. Himal Cement at Chovar could supply only 142,439 metric tons which is 9.40 percent of the estimated plan requirements. National Trading Ltd. is expected to import 170,450, metric tons during this period. From the import licenses issued in 1984/85 it is revealed that of the total imports 48.60 percent was by traders, 36.50 percent by different organisations and 14.90 percent by public sector organisations respectively. The total demand of iron and steel products was estimated to be 288,649 metric tons. To meet this, it was aimed to have Nepalese re-rolling mills would produce 140,00 metric tons of iron rods and to establish an electric are furnace with capacity of 20-22 thousand tons in the third year of the Plan period for producing 60,000 metric tons of billets. But the re-rolling mill produced 46,980 metric tons of iron rods only and the proposed arc furnace was not established. National Trading Ltd. would import 27,003 metric tons of iron rods and 2,258 metric tons of galvanised sheets. Imports of iron and steel goods through some private sector and foreign commodity aid have been consumed by several construction projects. The estimate of these imports of iron and steel products is 250,614 metric tons or 86. 80 percent of the estimated total demand. The requirement of bricks for the Sixth Plan period was estimated at 1,593,290 thousand pieces in the public and private sectors. Public sector brick and tiles factories produced 120,005 thousand bricks and 2,548 thousand tiles which partially met the requirement of the  and the balance by the private sector brick factories. During the Plan period there was a decline in brick production at 1,385,675 thousand pieces only (or 87.00 percent) because of the non-availability of adequate firewood from the fuel corporation in the later years of the Plan, difficulties in the supply of coal and of the increasing prices of firewood and coal. During the Sixth Plan period, the requirement of timber was estimated at 819,418 cubic meter, and only 433,  579 cubic meter in supply was estimated in all, 18.70 percent of this supply was distributed to the public sector activities and 81.30 percent to the private sector. In the Sixth Plan period, as a large proportion of the estimated requirement of the polythene pipes of 5,566 metric tons was met by the supply from the industries established at Balaju, Kalaiya and Dharan, there was less dependence on imports for supply. These industries are estimated to have produced 4,447 metric tons in the Plan period. During the Sixth Plan period, 187,099 metric tons of chemical fertilizers (89.90 percent of the estimated demand), consisting of 141,452 metric tons (109.00 percent) of nitrogenous fertilizers, 41,092 metric tons (85.00 percent) of phosphate and 4,555 metric tons (12.00 percent) of potash was imported during the Plan period against an estimated total requirement of 215,402 metric tons consisting of 129,292 metric tons of nitrogenous fertilizer, 41,802 metric tons of phosphate and 38,008 metric tons of potash. A total consumption of 630,000 metric tons of petroleum goods (63.40 percent of the estimated damned), which includes actual consumption of 477,864 metric tons during the first four years and estimated consumption of 152,000 metric tons in 1984/85, has been estimated for the Sixth Plan period against an estimated demand of 994,079 metric tons. During the plan period, petrol consumption increased by 1.90 percent, high speed diesel by 4.50 percent, L. P. gas by 4.30 percent and furnace oil by 7.40 percent. But the demand for kerosene oil and light diesel dropped by 0.10 percent and 2.10 percent respectively. Because the Fuel Corporation did fulfill this arrangement, concerned industries and private sector traders started importing coke and coal on their own. It is estimated that 142,532 metric tons of coke and coal was imported during the Plan period. It is estimated that 142,532 metric tons of coke and coal was imported during the Plan period. Only 16,400 metric tons or 27.50 percent of the projected demand was estimated to have been imported. Of this 30 percent is used by the government and the remaining 70 percent by the non-government sector. During the Sixth Plan period, the demand for newsprint was estimated at 7,143.00 metric tons of which 6,000 metric tons was required for Gorkhapatra Corporation alone. The Corporation imported 1,800 metric tons of newsprint during the period. A total of 3,000 metric tons of newsprint, including imports by the private sector is estimated to have been imported during the Plan period, which is 42.00 percent of the projected demand. Projected demand and actual supply of the construction and development goods during the Sixth Plan period are given in Table 1.31. Supply of Technical Manpower There was a total supply of 19,975 technical manpower as of 1979/80. The final year of the Fifth Plan. The total requirement of technical manpower at the end of 1984/85 was projected at 39,472, including additional requirement of 19,487 during the Sixth Plan. At the end of the Sixth Plan, it is expected that there would be a shortfall of 8,788 in the supply of technical manpower. The severe scarcity is felt among basic level technicians. In this level alone, there is a shortfall of 4,204 persons which is 47.80 percent of total deficit in supply. In the middle level, the shortfall is estimated at 3,312 persons (or 37.70 percent) and in the higher level 1,272 (or 14.50 percent). In totality, even though there appears to have shortages in all the three levels higher, middle and basic levels -there appears to have surplus of 2 and 180 in scientific and technical group (higher level) and forest sector forester group (basic level) respectively. And during the Sixth Plan period, a total of 1,250 scholarships was utilised. Thus, the shortage of technical manpower was to an extent obstacle in the effective implementation of development projects. Project demand and actual supply of technical manpower are presented in the Table 1.32. Physical Achievement It was envisaged that the principal foodgrain crops and cash crops would increase annually by 2.80 percent and 3.90 percent respectively in the Sixth Plan period. And the target for their combined growth rate was set at 3.00 percent. During the first four years of the plan period, foodgrain crops increased by 7.40 percent and cash crops by 2.20 percent. Against the potential production situation of the fifth year of the plan period, foodgrain production is expected to grow by 6.20 percent and cash crops by 4.20 percent on annual basic with the consequent average annual growth in agricultural production by 5.90 percent during the entire Sixth Plan period. The target for foodgrain production by the final year of the Sixth Plan i. e. 1984/85, was set at 4.346 million metric tons. The production of paddy and wheat surpassed the targets. The target set for the production of pulses was 95 thousand metric tons per year. But the production of sugarcane, oil, tobacco and jute is expected to fall short of the targets. In particular, the production of oil and jute fell sharply below targets. According to available statistics, the production of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and milk products marked a favourable situation. The distribution of agricultural inputs implements fell short of target of the Sixth Plan except for agricultural credit. In the first four years of the plan period, improved seed distribution attained 51 percent and chemical fertilizer 53 percent respectively of the targets of the Sixth Plan. Agricultural credit attained 68.00 percent of the target in the four years and it is expected the plan target will be met. Total acreage with irrigation facilities in public sector was 1,98,481 hectares by the end of the Fifth Plan, i. e. 1979/80. In the first four years of the Sixth Plan, irrigation facilities were made available to 73,212 hectares. In the final year of the plan 12,162 hectares of land are expected to have afforestation. Thus the total area under afforestation is 37,446 hectares i. e. 87.30 percent of the Sixth Plan target. There was an appreciable progress of achieving 87 percent of the target in afforestation. However, only 23 percent of the target could be fulfilled in the case of panchayat protected afforestation programme. With respect to soil and watershed conservation, control of 167 gorge (l08 percent of the target) and terrace improvement in 280 hectare (125 percent of the target) are estimated to be completed during the Sixth Plan period. Though it appears that achievement to satisfactory compared to the target of the Plan, yet it hardly leaves any room for satisfaction because the set programme themselves are for limited vis -a-vis the magnitude of the problems prevalent in the country. On the other hand, the soil erosion problem continues to be worsening. Industry There was an appreciable increase in industrial production since the second year as a result of improvement  in the power supply with the completion of the Kulekhani Hydel Project (capacity 60.00 Megawatts) and Devighat Hydel Project (capacity 14.10 Megawatts). The Sixth Plan had the target of increasing industrial production by 10 percent per annum. From the available statistics of the first four years, it is revealed that average annual rate of 10.40 percent was recorded, much in line with the Plan target. Industrial production could increase only at 0.40 percent in the first year of the Plan. But in the second, third and fourth years, industrial production increased at 10.50, 18.40 and 13.20 percent respectively. Keeping in view of the expected achievement in the final year, the average annual rate of increase of industrial production is estimated to be 10.30 percent with the Plan period. Among the new industries in the public sector, Hetauda Cement Factory is likely to go into trial production within the Plan period. The expansion of Himal Cement has lagged behind the schedule. The establishment of Lumbini Sugar Mill is still at a preliminary stage. The progress of construction of Ganesh Himal Lead Zinc Industry and Kharidhunga Magnesite Plants have remained slow and the construction of Rosin Turpentine industry at Kailali has not progressed satisfactorily. A target of disbursing Rs 502.70 million in industrial finance through Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) to private entrepreneurs was set in the Sixth Plan. NIDC has been able to disburse only Rs 204.30 million in industrial loans in the first four years of the Plan. Though the execution of the programmes for the promotion of cottage and small industries with World Bank assistance in the nine districts in Gandaki and Bagmati Zones was belatedly carried out from 1982/83, it seems to have picked up momentum appreciably of late. Under this programmes the credit of Rs 46.40 million, through banks has been disbursed by FY 1983/84. This has helped establish 1,413 small industries and create 13,678 job opportunities. Different kinds of vocational and technical training were imparted to 27,140 persons against a target of 28,950 persons in the Plan period under cottage industries development programme. The growth of tourist arrivals in 1980 and 1981 remained slow and picked up only in 1982. The number of tourist arrivals in that year increased by 8.50 percent and reached 175,000 persons. A study has been completed with the assistance of  to prepare a well- coordinated tourism development plan with proper analysis of problems and prospects of the promotion of tourism. Publicity and information promotion of tourism remained the principal programmes under public sector for the tourists. Hotel Management and Tourism Training Centre provided training to 603 persons against the Plan target of 625 persons. Permission was granted for international charter flights under private sector with a view to promote tourist arrivals. Transport and Communication The Sixth Plan had set the target of constructing 1,950 km of roads within the Plan period. By the end of the fourth year (1983/84), 1,516 Km of roads was constructed. Keeping in view of the attainable progress in the last year 1984/85, it is expected that construction of 1,742 Km will be completed by the Plan period. This makes 89.30 percent of the target. In view of the upgrading works of existing roads, the net increases in the length of roads appears to be 777 Km only in the first four years and 233 km in the fifth year of the Plan period. By the end of the Fifth Plan, there was a total length of 4,940 Km. with additional 1,010 Km, it is estimated that there is 5,950 Km of road in the country by the end of the Sixth Plan period. The progress of the construction of black topped road and fair weather roads appears satisfactory. In the first four years of the Plan period, 89.40 percent of the target of the construction of black topped roads and 93.60 percent in the case of fair weather roads were achieved respectively. The target for the installation of 23,450 telephone lines was set in the Sixth Plan. In the first four years 6,700 telephone lines were installed, making 28.60 percent of the target. The very slow progress in the installation of the telephone lines in  was the main reason for this poor progress. In the final year, an addition of 7,200 lines is estimated to be installed The total number of telephone lines at the end of the Sixth Plan period is thus expected to be 13,900. By 1979/80, the total installed capacity of power was 68,346 Kilowatts 52,588 Kilowatts in hydro electricity and 15,758 Kilowatts in diesel plants. The Sixth Plan envisaged the target of the generation of a total power of 144,923 Kilowatts of which 124,000 Kilowatts would be from major hydro power projects, 5,833 Kilowatts from micro hydro power projects and 15,000 Kilowatts from diesel plants. There was power crisis in the first two years of the Plan. In the third year the addition of Kulekhani power project (capacity 60,000 Kilowatts) and the addition of Devighat project (capacity 14,100 Kw.) eased the power crisis to a large extent. In the first four years of Plan, 86,045 Kilowatts were added. In the final year, 1,600 Kilowatts are expected to be added. Thus, in the Plan period, 87,645 Kilowatts is expected to be added, thus fulfilling 60.50 percent of the target. Transmission lines installed by the end of the fourth year is 90 Km. of 132 KV and 38 km of 66 KV. The transmission lines under installation-a) 542 km of 132 KV Hetauda-Biratnagar, Butwal-Nepalgunj and Dumkibas-Butwal, and b) 135 km. of 33 KV Dharan-Dhankuta, Trisuli- Dhunche-Shomdang, Kharidhunga-Charikot, Ghorahi- Tulsipur, covering a total length of 677 km. are expected to remain so under construction. Education There was an appreciable progress in education in the first four years of the Plan period. Target of the literacy rate at 32.40 percent was set in the Plan. By the end of the fourth year, the literacy rate attained was 27.80 percent and is expected to reach 28.90 percent by the end of the fifth year. The Sixth Plan envisaged the target of imparting access to primary education (class I-V) to 75 percent of the children of 6-10 years age. In the fourth year itself the target was exceeded and reached 76.10 percent. Though progress in the lower middle level and middle level is expected to be low against the target, the progress nonetheless, is encouraging. In the lower middle level (Class VI-VII) the target was set at reaching 40 percent of the children (11-12 years age) and in the middle level (Class VIII-X) reaching 30 percent of the children (13-15 years age) in terms of access of education. By the end of the Plan period, it is expected that 35 percent of the children will have been receiving lower middle level education and 24 percent of children middle level education. In the first four years, 254,000 persons were provided with adult education and by the end of the Plan 277,000 additional persons are expected to be receiving it. Thus, in the field of adult education, 28.20 percent of the target was met in the first four years and by the end of the Plan period, 30.70 percent of the target is expected to be achieved. In the field of higher education, the target was envisaged to admit 21,244 students in different fields - 5,892 students in technical, 9,347 students in vocational, 6,005 students in general education. The progress of the first four years and that expected in the fifth year together shows that 108.40 percent of the target in technical, 43.30 percent in vocational and 69.40 percent in general would be achieved. Health and Drinking Water Special attention has been given to the extension of basic health services and medical care in providing minimum health services to the people in the Sixth Plan. In the first four years 161 health posts were opened. So by the end of the Plan 211 additional health posts would be opened thus fulfilling 45.20 percent of the target (467 additional health posts). Also, the target was set to employ 1250 rural health workers but only 511 health workers could be  employed by the Plan period. According to the aim of converting gradually the health post into integrated health posts, 450 health posts in 23 districts have been converted into integrated health post partially or in full. In the case of medical care; the number of hospitals and beds could not be increased as per the Plan target because of the delay in construction of hospitals and quarters. Regarding construction of 15 bed hospitals, hospital buildings are under construction in 20 districts. Programmes launched under preventive health services have contributed remarkably in the control of malaria, leprosy and other epidemic diseases. It is expected that 1.524 million couples would be provided with these facilities. This achievement has been possible because from the third year of the Plan period, family planning programmes were extended more effectively. Drinking Water: The target was to supply 317.40 million litres of water per day 177.80 million per day in the rural areas and 139.60 million litres per in the urban areas- through distribution by pipes within the Plan period. In the first four years of the Plan, 71.70 million litres per day were supplied in the rural areas and 52.20 million litres in the urban areas. Taking into account the possible water supply position in the fifth year, it is expected that the total supply of drinking water will reach 211.20 million litres per day by the end of the Sixth Plan-l07.50 million litres per day in the rural areas and 103.90 million litres in the urban areas. Thus, only 66.60 percent of the Plan target. in water supply is expected to be achieved. This achievement will supply drinking \"water to 12.20 percent of the total population11.70 percent of the population in the rural areas and 79.90 percent of the population in the urban areas through the pipe system. PART - II CHAPTER 2 OBJECTIVES AND BASIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF THE SEVENTH PLAN Background: The completion of the Sixth Plan period marks the end of the chapter on the history of nearly three decades  of planned development of the country. When the country first embarked upon the process of a planned development in the fiscal year 1956/57, inadequate development of infrastructures was the major constraint. Past efforts in the process of planned development have brought about substantial and significant achievements in the development of physical and social infrastructures. Based on these achievements, a new chapter was added in the history of development, which led to the inclusion of far-reaching objectives such as fulfilling minimum basic needs of the people. In the context of drawing up the outline of the Seventh economic development plan of the nation, it is but natural that the picture of the implementation status of the current sixth plan should come up for a brief review. At the time of the formulation of the sixth plan and thereafter for the first two and a half years of the implementation, on the one hand the attention of the entire nation was concentrated on the important political exercise and on the other, the third year of the plan dawned only to find the country in the grip of a severe drought. Due to favourable weather conditions, the national production situation remained good in the first two years. In 1979/80, the base year of the sixth plan, a decrease in GDP because of unfavourable weather conditions took a turn for the better the following year and, as a result, GDP increased abnormally by 8.3 percent. In the second year also, GDP increased by 3.8 percent. Again in the fourth year, GDP increased by 7.4 percent. Thus, during the first four years of the plan period*; the average annual growth rate of GDP is estimated to be 4.5 percent. During this period, trends were unfavourable in the government finance monetary, price, foreign trade and  balance of payments situations. As significant accomplishments remained elusive in the mobilization of revenue, reliance on deficit financing increased to finance public sector expenditures, until it reached the all time high of Rs 2070 million in the fiscal year 1982/83 compared to Rs 960 million in the previous year. In the fiscal year 1983/84 despite efforts to contain deficit financing, it did fall below the level of Rs 1390 million. The \\texcessive \\tdeficit financing led to the expansion of money supply with its adverse impact on price level and balance of payments position of the country. During those four years, money supply increased at an annual rate of 14.9 percent and the price at 11 percent per annum. The continuos increase in imports without corresponding increases in export set the stage for the foreign trade balance to become more and more unfavourable. Decline in agricultural production due to unpropitious weather conditions followed by heavy pressure on imports, as a result of the deficit financing, disturbed after many years in 1982/83 the balance of payments position of the country as well. In that year, the country had to face a big deficit of Rs 680 million. In order to reduce the deficits in balance of payments, administrative steps were taken to control import since 1983/84. Economic imbalance of this sort created a situation in 1983/84, the fourth year of the plan, where this quantum of public investment had to be kept within strict bounds. It now appears that the rate of public investment as envisaged in the plan may not at all be possible to maintain. From a review of the plan implementation of the first four years, it appears that progress in important sectors will lag far behind the targets. In particular, during the period under review, achievements in power and irrigation, which have a pivotal role to play in expanding the productive capabilities of the economy, were so low that there is a fear that the attempts at rapidly accelerating the growth rate in tile coming plan period may come up against severe obstacles. Progress of transport sector was good though specially, construction of suspension bridges, which were taken in hand to provide minimum rural transport facilities, failed to keep up a satisfactory rate of progress. In the expansion of basic health service and drinking water facilities, too, the achievements fell far behind the target set by the plan. The only exceptions were the education sector where the progress achieved was really encouraging. In spite of the gap between targets and achievements, the nation was able to achieve some progress in various social and economic sectors. The irrigation facilities provided under the public sector recorded an increase by 26 percent, bringing the total irrigated area to 251,000 hectares. The installed power, capacity has been more than doubled to 154 megawatts, which has been proved a great boon to the smooth functioning of industrial enterprises. Road facilities have gone up by 16 percent to 5,727 Kms. Similarly, telephone facilities have risen by 48 percent, to 20,580 lines. Literacy, which was 22.1 percent in 1979/80 has soared to 27.8 percent in 1983/84. Likewise, the ratio of primary school going age children estimated at 64 percent in 1980, reached 76 percent in 1984. Remarkable progress has been scored in the fields of lower secondary and secondary education. The proportion of people enjoying drinking water facilities has increased from 10.6 percent to 18.8 percent. During this period, serious attempts have been made strengthen institutional bases to stimulate development on various fronts. In the final year of the plan period (l984/85), agricultural production is expected to be normal. It was followed in the year 1983/84 by the completion of the Devighat project, which added 14.1 megawatt to the national grid. This led to the substantially improvement in power supply position which in turn contributed a great deal to overcome bottleneck affecting the establishment and operation of industries, and this is therefore expected to spur industrial activities. For these reasons, GDP is expected to increase by 4 percent this year. But the base year 1979/80 of the sixth plan was a bad year from the point of view of production. If the average annual growth rate of the later four-year of the Plan period is considered, the growth rate comes to be 3.4 percent. The target of the GDP growth rate of the sixth plan is 4.3 percent. Although success has been scored in gaining limited goals, one cannot lose sight of the fact, first, that the execution of the plan has failed to proceed at the prescribed rate and, secondly, that no dynamism has been introduced in the development of the economy. Agricultural sector, the source of livelihood and employment of the bulk of the population, continues to lean heavily on uncertain weather conditions. Significant achievements in enhancing agricultural production and productivity are yet to be realized. land, the principal source of fuel supply, is shrinking rather than increasing in area. Mounting erosion and landslide are undermining the base of the hill economy. On the other hand, the sharp rise in population is compounding the already complex economic problems. In the absence of adequate efforts to mobilise internal resources, investment capabilities have been considerably narrowed down. On the other hand, sluggishness in taking firm steps designed to streamline and strengthen development administration has cast a shadow on the implementation of projects. This, in turn, has made the economy incapable of putting to good use the resources provided under the foreign aid. In this connection, it may be pointed out that the indigenous populations are not getting advantages from whatever job openings are being created by investments. Viewed against this background, it becomes patently clear that mere mouthing of catchy slogans or coining of claptrap phrases cannot be relied upon to overcome the problems the nation is facing today as well as those which it will be saddled with tomorrow. The problems are there, standing out bright and clear, so are the means of getting to grips with them. In this context, the Seventh Plan should be viewed against the background of the following challenges: (a) To narrow down the gulf between planning and implementation, between word and deed, and to step forward to carry out what has been laid down and translate the vision into reality, (b) To focus the entire attention and endeavour of the nation on the tasks of increasing production and employment opportunities, and fulfilling the minimum basic needs of the common man as laid down so clearly in the sixth plan, (c) To build up the productive capabilities of the economy on the basis of the development of land and water resources, which form the physical endowments of the nation, (d) \\tTo devote proper attention to conserving and expanding the natural wealth, and From this, it follows that what is needed is to concentrate our efforts towards giving concrete shapes to the  objectives and development policies singled out in the current plan instead of talking about additional things and  hunting for new catchwords in the course of the Seventh Plan period. If this is to be the line of action, certain amendments and alterations will have to be made in the development policies of the Seventh Plan, keeping in view those additional challenges that have emerged during the Sixth Plan period. Nevertheless, the basic approach should be not so much to scatter the limited financial resources at our disposal as to concentrate them on matters of top priorities as enunciated in the plan itself. Similarly, in view of the limited financial resources and shortage of technical manpower, the current projects and programmes may have to be subjected to a close scrutiny, and steps taken to strike out those that are either inconsistent with the objectives and development strategies of the plan or very low in priority rating. In conclusion, besides dedicating the political will and commitment to economic development, which is a logical thing to do against the background of the political stability prevailing in the country, effective implementation of the Seventh Plan largely hinges on two things. One of them is to be able to build up an atmosphere, which will allow an efficient harnessing of internal resources, and another is to give added strength and competence to development administration and to create such conditions as are designed to encourage the government employees to dedicate themselves to nation building under a new wave of eagerness, excitement and enthusiasm. Absence of these two things will mean that we shall once again fail in our attempt at bridging the gap between what we say and what we do; Moreover, to increase the tempo of local development works, the panchayat sector should be galvanized into action with a greater sense of accountability, and emphasis should be laid on topping local organizational set-ups, local leaderships and local resources to meet the minimum basic needs of the local people and also in responding to the demand for local development in line with the spirit of the principles of decentralization. While working out the draft of the coming Seventh Plan, it has been the endeavour to keep the above mentioned points in mind constantly and unfailingly. 2. Objectives: Development goals of a nation are necessarily long term. They cannot be achieved within a sort time-span. The rational of periodic plans is to attain those objectives, and they are designed solely with that end in view. Looked at from the standpoint of our economic conditions and realities, the objectives laid down in the Sixth Plan are of equal relevance and significance today. As the nation will still need a long time to reach those objectives, they have been set forth as the objectives of the Seventh Plan also. They are: (a) To increase production at a higher rate. (b) To increase opportunities for productive employments, and (c) To fulfill the minimum basic needs of the people. (a) To increase production at a higher rate The existing problems of indigence and unemployment cannot be sorted out till the productive capacity of the nation and purchasing power of the people were stepped up. Also, without raising productivity the concept of social justice will be no more than a vision and a dream-a shadow without substance. Such is the hard economic reality of ours today. In the decade ranging from 1971/72 to 1981/82 national production has succeeded in growing at the rate of 3 percent per annum, whereas the population has started growing by 2.66 percent every year. And as the agricultural sector failed to register substantial achievements, the development pace of the economy has been clogged up. Since there is a close and intimate inter-relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, lack of dynamism in  the former has had the effect of limiting both the speed and scope of development in the latter. Dull and insipid growth of production cannot lead to the growth of the capacity to save, nor can it breathe a new life in the export trade. Over the past several years population has been growing at a rate much faster than the national production, with the result that our development processes have been barely enough to sustain the increasing pressure of population, leaving us with nothing to push up the economic standard of the broad masses. There are signs that the performance of the sixth plan in terms of economic growth rate will be slightly better than its predecessor, but as the population has started growing at a faster rate than in the preceding years, the end result can be expected to be no more than a marginal improvement in the standard of living. The agricultural sector is no exception in this regard. From the demonstrations of the research farms and the actual crop outputs of the pioneer peasants, it has been seen that farm output can be increased by three to four times more than at present. True it is that our peasants are mostly unlettered, but that does not mean that they are not endowed with the intellectual capacity to utilize those techniques with full knowledge and understanding. What is wanted is nothing but the means to place those techniques within their reach to provide them with sufficient amount of irrigation water, production tools and equipments required for the use of those techniques, and to ensure an effective framework within which they can hope to get a fair price for the larger number of things produced by their labour and investment. This is not to say that no attempt has so far been made to bring such a set-up to birth. But it appears that much more remains to be done to make it a viable unit. is another our national resources, and its development is necessary for the overall development of the economy. Through the effective conservation and utilization of these resources we can fulfill a number of multifaceted economic necessities of the nation-fuel woods to cook food; charcoal and raw materials to keep the industries running; timbers to build houses; fodder for animal husbandry; herbs to manufacture medicine; national parks for the development of tourism industry; soil conservation to maintain and keep up the fertility of land and to prevent disastrous floods and landslides. On our nation has nature conferred an almost limitless wealth in the form of water, holding infinite development prospects for our economy. Much of the future development of our economy rests on the judicious and effective use of this vast resource. It can playa big part in the promotion of energy based industries, in the creation of electric- powered transportation system, and in the increment of our export capabilities along with rapid advances in electrification, irrigation, drinking water facilities, fish farming and tourism. It is, therefore, essential that further efforts be made to ensure a mu lti-purpose development and use of this valuable resource with our sights firmly set on its long-run prospects. Although the full range of infrastructures required for a speedier industrialization programme has yet to come into being, it does not mean that there are no chances open to those who are willing to set up industries by optimizing the use of whatever basic conditions have been created. Chiefly, enough possibilities are there for setting up small industries based on indigenous farm products and imported raw materials. As far as export-oriented industries are concerned, attention can be focussed on improving the quality and increasing the quantity of those goods which have already made a dent, however small, in the fiercely competitive export market as a result of the efforts aimed at fostering the growth of such industries. To usher in an atmo sphere conducive to industrial development, special attention has to be given to maintaining a good rapport between the government and the industrialists, taking steps to ensure prompt availability of industrial facilities to entrepreneurs, fostering harmonious relations between the mill- owners and workers, working out a balance between productivity and wage rates, keeping government control and interference in the industrial investment activities to the bare minimum and encouraging free competition. Tourism has now appeared on the scene as a viable modem source of increasing foreign exchange receipts of the country. Increasing efforts should be made to develop tourism on a big scale and in a planned way. According to available data, only 42 percent of the capacity of irrigation projects are being tapped. From this, it follows that additional acreage can reap the benefit from irrigation facilities by improving the distribution networks alone if nothing else. In the areas having transport facilities, attempt should be made to develop horticulture  and livestock for commercial purposes, and to set up small industries by taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by surface transportation. Attempts also can be made to foster increase industrial output by running the industries already commissioned in the public and private sectors to their full capacity. Areas that hold promise for quick production against small investment should be identified, and the flow of investment should be channeled that way. (b) To increase opportunities for productive employment The problem of employment has been further exacerbated by the steep growth of population. According to  the census report 1981, the labour force has been augmented by 2 million within inter censul decade 1971-1981, which works out to an annual increment of 0.2 million. As job opportunities in non-agricultural sectors could not be created to the requisite extent, the pressure on agriculture, which has the dubious distinction of employing the greatest number of people, went on increasing. The growth rate in the agricultural sector itself has been rather slow and leisurely. Hence, the effect of the rapid expansion in the number of the job-seeking people has been to further intensify the already complicated problems of semi-employment. This problem has already assumed formidable proportion in the hill areas, in particular, where lands that can be brought under the plough are limited. At the same time, educated unemp loyment seems to be on the increase. The ultimate aim of any economic development is nothing else but to upgrade the living standard of the people at large an aim, which can be realized on condition that production and employment are stepped up considerably. The living standard of the bulk of the population can be pushed up through the creation of jobs. To include the employment-oriented development policy, in the Seventh Plan is , therefore, relevant to the present context also. In view of the structure of the country\\'s economy, the only source which can lead to the multiplication of employment, opportunities to a large extent seems to be a faster development of the agricultural sector. The scope of the non-agricultural sectors being very narrow at present, they cannot be expected to provide employment to a large segment of the population, no matter how fast is the rate of development of these sectors. In the decade between 1971and 1981, this sector has been able to absorb only 17 percent (338,000) of the growing population, leaving the balance of 83 percent (1,660,000) with no choice except to have recourse to the agricultural sector. Again, the expansion of the non-agricultural sector is conditioned by the growth of the agricultural sector. To take the case of rural areas, agricultural growth helps increase employment by engendering economic activities in non-agricultural areas. It is, therefore, essential that from the point of view of multiplying job opportunities also overall priority be now given to agricultural development. To expand the scope of employment in the industrial sector, the imperatives of the limited internal market require that priority be accorded to the development of small, labour-intensive industries. If the labour intensive industrial development policy is to be made effective, .it must be ensured that the policies governing, in particular, the industrial tax and credit concessions together with the industrial wages and labour welfare schemes are not devised in such a way as to provide impetus to heavily capital intensive industrial investments. Foreign trade policies also should be put into effect in a manner supportive of increasing employment opportunities within the country. To this end, stress should be laid on export-promoting manufacturing activities and concentrated attention should be given to producing and exporting agro-allied and labour oriented commodities. Improvement in the productivity and income level of workers is contingent upon the quality of work. Not only has this situation kept the domestic productivity at a lower level. Short supply of indigenous people who can offer the kind of skill on demand in the market has triggered an inflow of foreign labour. It has become, therefore, all the more important that vocational and skill-oriented trainings be evolved to make the workforce of the country more efficient and skillful. Moreover, it is high time that steps be taken to ban the unrestricted entry of foreign nationals in order to create conditions where our own compatriots are enabled to take full advantage of the new avenues opened up in the country as a result of economic development (c) To fulfill the minimum basic needs of the people: As the resources available for investment are limited, a decision should be taken on where to guide the flow of investment and for the purpose of increasing the supply of which commodities or services. It will be recalled that  the target set by the sixth plan was to channel investment to meet the minimum basic needs of the people. During the Seventh Plan period also, it is necessary that the following be viewed as the minimum basic needs and that all attempts be centered on meeting them: 7) Minimum rural transport facilities. Foodgrain: Food is the basic of all human needs. Man can work with any enthusiasm only when he has enough to eat and is healthy. It is, therefore, not only essential but indispensable to invest in raising food production as much as possible. Although investment has regularly been made in increasing food production over the past so many years, we  have failed in our attempt to keep the growth of food production in step with the rise in population. In the decade between 1971 and 1981 our population has grown from 11,556,000 to 15,023,000 (a growth of 30 percent), while foodgrain production within the same period climbed from 3,486,000 metric tons to 3,829,000 metric tons (a gain of 10 percentage points only). As population growth has started out-stripping the volume of food production, the amount of supply available for internal consumption as dwindled more and more. Food production has now reached a level where it cannot be deemed sufficient to meet the minimum nutritional needs of the people. In the hill areas, food crisis is now so frequent that it has almost become an annual feature and the food deficit districts have been increasing in number. The rising cost of food distribution has exerted increasing pressure on the budget year after year. From the food crises arising out of the drought of 1979/80 and 1982/83 it has become more than clear that our foodgrains production position has come down to a really wretched level. It is clear that in the present situation all our attention and attempts be irrevocably committed to increase adequate food grain production. We shall be able to give proper attention to other acts of economic development only if our all out assault on the food production is crowned with success. Clothing: Another thing essential to the daily life of the people is clothing. Being a country with different climates, we require clothing suited to summer and winter conditions. At the moment we have to depend largely on foreign countries to meet our clothing requirements. Since there is an extensive market within the country, various kinds of cloth can be produced indigenously. The crying need is to launch solid programmes in the country for the production of essential raw materials. Industrial demands of those items that cannot be produced internally or that can be produced only to prohibitive costs can be met by import. Being a labour intensive enterprise textile industry has the potential of generating employment opportunities in abundance. It has, therefore, become a thing of paramount importance that steps be taken to develop textile industry in a planned manner and on a wider scale. Clothing is one of the basic necessities of the general public and therefore, its production cost is to be at the minimum level and economical. Excessive protection of this industry is not desirable from the viewpoint of overall industrial development of the country. If imported clothes sell at a cheaper rate than the comparable indigenous products, the goal of providing people with low cost clothing will remain unfulfilled. For this reason, the formulation of textile industry development policies and drawing up of requisite plans should be preceded by a detailed study on the various technical and economic aspects involved in the development of textile industries within the country. Fuelwood The next thing that should draw our attention after food and clothing is firewood. The bulk of our household requirement for fuel, whether for cooking or heating, are met by fuelwood. In the case of the rural families, wood is the only source of energy. However much we increase our investment in the generation of hydro-electricity, it will be quite a long time before wood is supplal1ted by electricity, particularly in view of the fact that to an ordinary household, electricity cannot rival wood in price. As the purchasing power of our rural population is very low and the cost of production, very high, they will not be able to afford electricity for many more years to come. Under the present circumstances wood would remain to be the cheapest source of energy for t he majority of our people compared to other energy alternatives.\\' But our forest resources have been badly depleted within the last two decades chiefly on account of the high  growth of population. In the 15 years between 1963/64 and 1978/79 the area covered by forest had shrunk from 6.4 million hectares to 4.3 million hectares. Of this, the land under forest is estimated to have shrunk from 4.6 million hectares to 3.9 million hectares in the mountain and from 1.8 million hectares to 0.4 million hectares in the Terai. In other words, 15 percent of the forest in the mountainous region and 78 percent in Terai have been decimated bringing the total to 33 percent. Depletion of forest in the neighborhood of villages and other human settlements has forced the inhabitants to spend a longer and longer time in gathering firewood. Of all the thing, the most serious is that forests that are left with us are not enough to meet the annual fuel needs of the people. This is a situation, which helps intensify the depredations. If we fail to take rapid steps to tackle this problem on a war footing, the situation will go from bad to worse. According to studies made on the status of the forest wealth, it has been found that if the present rates of ravages are to go on unchecked, there will be not a single patch of forest left in the country within the next two decades. The national demand for fuelwood cannot now be met on a short-term basis. Even if we draw up a plan to meet our annual requirements in the course of the next two decades, we shall have to put a degree of effort far greater than what we are used to now. According to a study made in this connection this target will be achievable only if we go on increasing the tree plantation rate in such a way as to cover an area of 50,000 hectares by 1990 and 120,000 hectares by 2000. From this one can easily form an idea about how extensive the scope of the tree plantation programme should be. To step up the supply of firewood, reforestation and conservation programmes should be launched in the form of a campaign, particularly in areas close to human habitations both rural and urban. Effective steps should also be taken to implement such programmes by the panchayat and private sectors on a commercial basis. Drinking Water Another basic necessity is drinking water. By the end of the terminal year of the Fifth Plan, 1979/80, the facility of piped water was extended to 1,548,000 of the population. According to the census of 1981, the total population of the country is estimated to have reached 14,634,000. It will thus be seen that the population covered by the piped water distribution system stood at 10.6 percent in 1979/80. In the fourth year of the sixth plan, 1983/84, this facility was brought within the reach of 2,545,000 persons, which constituted 17.7 per cent of the estimated population (16,253,000) of that year. . In such a  situation housewives have to devote a lot of time and energy to the task of fetching water-time and energy, which could have been better spent on some productive work. Further, contaminated water is at the root of all kinds of diseases. Besides, the resulting control of waterborne diseases will improve the health status of the people and push up the level of their productivity. That is why it is deemed essential that priority be assigned to expand the coverage of drinking water facility in the Seventh Plan. Emphasis has all along been placed on the expansion of the primary health care services as it happens to be the only way by which minimum health facilities to the rural population can be ensured. The number of health posts, which were to serve as the institutional medium for the delivery if the health care package, was increased year by year until it reached 744 in 1983/84. The present ratio between health posts and population is 1: 21, 845. In addition, it is also urgently required that the quality of services made available through these health posts be improved appreciably. At the same time, enough attention should be given to both rural and urban sanitation. Most of the diseases spring from ignorance and environmental pollution. To convince the people of the virtues of cleanliness, a publicity campaign should be mounted, using both the educational and publicity and broadcasting media. In this connection, it is most appropriate to activate village and town panchayats in such campaigns. Primary and skill-based education and adult education Literate and skilled labour is a pre-requisite to the all-round development of the nation. For this reason, any attempt directed at providing literacy and skill to the greatest number of people within the shortest possible time is a matter of national priority. During the Sixth Plan period, much has been achieved in this direction. In 1983/84, the fourth year of the sixth plan, 76 percent of the children of primary-school age are estimated to have been enjoying primary education facilities. Some progress was made in the development of technical and vocational education. Efforts in those directions should be continued in the years lying ahead. Minimum rural transport facility Transport has a highly significant part to play in a country like ours where the topography is dominated by mountains, rivers and streams. Development of transport links hitherto isolated pockets and settlements to developing areas and incorporates them with the stream of national economic development. It also makes it possible to explore new avenues of development. But on the other hand, investment in the construction of costly motorable roads of modern standard cannot be economically justifiable in those mountain regions where due to the backward state of their economies the volume of traffic tends to remain low. At the moment the policy will be to construct truck worthy single lane jeepable mud roads in such areas, depending on the density of traffic of each place, and to build mule tracks, suspension and wooden bridges to link up the villages with near by periodic markets and other commercial outlets. Later, as economic activities go on expanding, creating a correspondingly bigger volume of traffic, the roads designed for vehicular traffic can be widened and then gravelled and macadamized. As things stand now, the most appropriate transport development policy will be to link up a maximum number of places at the minimum level of cost. 3. Basic development strategies To achieve the development objectives of the Seventh Plan, investment and efforts will have to be devoted to two directions simultaneously. The first direction is to help utilize to the full extent the infrastructures already created and to concentrate investment on programmes that are likely to boost production without undue loss of time. Secondly, the level of investment will be increased in the creation of those basic pre-requisites, which are essential to the strengthening of the foundations of the economy and to the quickening of the tempo of development in the years to come. If owing to resource constraint simultaneous advance on both these fronts is not possible, priority will be accorded to the first line of action. Subject to this fundamental investment policy, the following shall constitute our basic development strategies to achieve the objectives of the Seventh Plan. a) To accord overall priority to the development of agricultural sector In the present state of our country, to impart dynamism to agricultural sector is a matter of paramount importance, if we really mean to increase our production multiply employment opportunities and fulfil the minimum need of the people. Agriculture has been the source of income and employment to the majority of the people, Poverty is most rampant in the agricultural sector. Hence, to lift up the standard of living of the majority of the poor people, it is imperative that the agricultural sector be developed and advanced. Development of agricultural sector is essential to the industrialization of the country and the promotion of export trade. Industrial products will enjoy a bigger market if the purchasing power of the farmers can be strengthened. Similarly, the supply of industrial raw materials becomes possible only when the agricultural sector is developed and expanded. If we succeed in increasing the volume of production of foodgrains and other farm products in plenty and at low cost, the wages of industrial workers and prices of raw materials will remain at a low level, making our industries more able to stand up to international competition. If industrial commodities can be produced at a cheaper rate, they will be widely accepted in the domestic market. And in this process the foundations of industrial development will be consolidated. At the present stage, the development of export sector also hings on our capacity to boost up agriculture production. Thus, from all considerations, since agricultural has to play a substantial role in the economic advancement of the country, it is essential to assigne top priority to this sector during the Seventh Plan period also. Hence, with agriculture as the focal point, the policy will be to lay the development of economy on a strong foundation by linking up the development bases of industry and export trade with the progress of this sector. To combat the serious problems facing the villagers on account of the destruction of forest, tree plantation programmes will be conducted on a war footing. The existing forest will be developed and improved under scientific management, and wide-ranging programmes will be launched to increase the production of firewood and timbers. Besides, to relieve the pressure on forest, programmes in large numbers will be put under way to popularize the use of fuel-efficient stoves and bio-gas plants. As a result of the depredations of the forest wealth and cultivation of hill slopes, flood and landslide disasters are on the increase, and the fertility of the high lands is on the wane. These problems, which were born of the ecological imbalances, should now be taken up very seriously. To this end, soil and watershed conservation programmes will be carried out on a wider scale. As these programmes are very costly and have wide ramifications, it will be necessary, on the one hand, to strengthen the means of enlisting popular participation in their implementation and to fix priorities in their implementation on the basis of urgency before initiating them, on the other. In addition, the present land use situation will be studied on its basis, policies and programmes relating to land use will be drawn up and put into effect. c) To put emphasis on development of water resources As natural resources have a prominent part to play in the socio-economic development of the country, the exploitation of this abundant resource is imperative for development. Of all the natural resources available in the country, water resources occupies the place of prominence. Hence, to intensify the allround development campaign of the country, water resources will be mobilized as an important development resource. Various programmes will be taken in hand to develop and expand irrigation facilities and power and drinking water supply services respectively in the interest of agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors that stand to gain direct benefits from the development of water resources. If the programmes enumerated above can be taken up as a single multi-purpose project, preference will be given to such a unified approach. To tie up the development bases of the country\\'s economy with the mobilization and utilization of the water resource, steps will be gradually taken towards developing power-based transportation systems and inland waterways along with energy-based industries (e. g. chemical fertilizers). At the same time, special attention will be given to develop it as an exporTable commodity. A master plan will be drawn up to maximize the use of water resources, which is so abundantly available in the country. Thus, particular attention will be given to mobilize this resource in such a way as to make it a source of foreign exchange earning of the country, in addition to meeting internal requirements. A clear-cut policy will be laid down and necessary arrangements made to implement the huge water resources development programmes on the basis of the mutual cooperation of the neighbouring countries. As such, programmes will be set afoot to preserve and enlarge it. While mobilizing this resource, due attention will be given to environmental aspects also. Besides, statistical information on water resources of the country will be regularly collected, and their potentialities will be constantly studied and analyzed. The scope of activities of the existing water and energy commission will be expanded to enable it to play an active role in mounting comprehensive studies on the feasibility of utilizing and developing the almost limitless water resource of the country and on the ways and means of developing alternative sources of energy. It will also be increasingly associated with conducting proper studies on the economic and legal aspects of water utilization, eva luating project proposals, and re-evaluating completed projects. This commission will be evolved as a competent technical unit charged with carrying out all kinds of studies in connection with the development of water resources. Institutional arrangements will be made to strengthen the implementation side of the water resources development and to assume full responsibility for detailed designs, planning, construction, and servicing of the approved projects. (d) To emphasize the development of industries Owing to the low purchasing power of the people, internal market is very small. As a result, there is very limited scope for the establishment of big industries. Taking into account the geographical situation of the country and present development status of the natural resources available within the country, the prospects for those large-scale industries to be set up with an eye to the external market do not appear to be very bright. Such being the case, the industrialization of the country has relied on the opening of small industries. As the establishment of small industries does not call for a huge outlay of capital, sophisticated technology and modern management methods, they are well within the capacity of our small investors. As such industries are by nature labour-intensive, their extensive proliferation can be turned into an important source of employment. And if concentrated efforts are directed toward intensive development of those industries, which have proven their capacity to compete in the external markets, they can also become a reliable source of foreign exchange earnings. As a result, some success have also been scored. It is, however, necessary to put in more effort for their extensive development. The experiences gained so far -in setting them up will be reviewed, and special attempts will be made to remove the bottlenecks and mistakes, wherever found, in order to ensure their steady progress. (e) To emphasize the promotion of export trade To economize the transit costs in connection with the export trade with the third countries, steps will be taken to improve the current transit mechanism and procedures with the view of increasing efficiency and reducing costs. (f) To emphasize tourism development Tourism is another area, which is growing fast to provide employment to the people and augment the foreign exchange earning of the country. It holds a good prospect for wide expansion. Tourism promotion programmes will be made more effective by removing those obstacles that have stood in the way of attracting more tourists and lengthening their stay. And, steps will be taken for the private sector to make more involved in the investment programmes which helps to develop tourism. (g) To curb the population growth rate There is an urgent need to check the population growth, which is taking place at such a rate that can hardly be sustained by the country\\'s economy. For this purpose, the policies and programmes already devised will be carried out with greater vigour and on a wider scale as well as in a coordinated manner. Concrete steps will also be taken to stem the flow of immigration. (h) To consolidate the foundations of national economic integration The policy which has been framed to promote the growth of different development zones on the basis of their respective natural endowments and development potentials in order to reduce regional imbalances and strengthen the basis of the integration of the economy will be followed in the Seventh Plan period, too, Agricultural, forest and land conservation, and tourism development programmes, in particular, will be launched on a priority basis to foster the productive capabilities of the remote and backward hill areas. In conformity to the planned objective of providing minimum basic requirements of the people, the policy will be to give priority to and raise the level of investment in these areas for the expansion of drinking water, basic health care, primary and skill oriented education, and rural transport facilities. (i) To improve management of the economy by decentralizing decision- making and execution processes It is not possible for the government to shoulder all the responsibilities for economic development, nor is that the proper way to achieve the objective of advancing the economic growth at a faster pace. Excessive concentration of economic decision-making processes and activities inhibits the enthusiasm, skill and capacity of the economic units and limits the development potentials of the economy. The proper step will, therefore, be to orient the economy in the direction of phase-wise decentralization. To try to satisfy all the wants and requirements, whether big or small of all the village and town panchayats scattered all over the country cannot be regarded as practical proposition. The appropriate thing would be for the local Panchayats as a representative of local people to step forward to overcome the hardship experienced by the local people and to take in hand those small developments works which have great importance in the local context. The aim of the Act is to speed up the process of development through the medium of popular participation, by entrusting the local panchayats with the task of local development. In order to realize this objective it is of utmost importance that the administration of the local panchayat units be strengthened and shored up and that their competence to mobilize local means and resources be geared up. Institutionalized development is not a matter that can be achieved at a stroke. It must be built from the bottom up. It calls for a good deal of time and energy. During the Seventh Plan period, concrete steps will be taken to develop in the village, town and district panchayats the ability to formulate, execute and maintain development projects and to mobilize resources. (2) Government-owned corporations His Majesty\\'s Government has invested sufficiently in Government owned industrial and commercial corporations. Still it has not been able to get adequate returns from them, on the contrary, there are some corporate bodies who continue to charge on the government budget even at this stage. It is indeed high time that the government-owned corporations be run ably and efficiently after making suiTable improvements in their managerial aspects. Excessive government controls and interference in them should be abolished and the managers should be given a free hand in conducting corporation business. Every corporation should have a clear notion of what the government expects from it. A measuring rod should also be devised to rate its performance. The performance of each manager should be evaluated and he should be rewarded or punished on its basis. Evolution of such a system of the rod and carrot is necessary in the interest of efficiency. Practical steps will be taken in this direction during the Seventh Plan period. (3) Private Sector An atmosphere which is suited to the private sector to play an active part in the economic development has to be created. As the investment activities of the private sector are determined by the interplay of market forces, attention will be given to make them more competitive and competent For this purpose, government interferences and control in the investment, activities of the private sector and _in the price fixing processes of goods, services and means of production will be kept at the minimum. Institutiona1 bases that have a direct bearing on the efficient operation of private enterprises will be strengthened. Special attention will be given to providing support and assistance to those small farmers, industrialists and professionals, in particular, who are eager to improve their economic conditions by making good use of whatever capital, skill, application and zeal they have in their possession. The economic policies of the government will be tilted in the direction of stimulating savings, investment and productive activities in the private sector. Steps will be taken to evolve an excellent rapport between the public and private sectors. (j) To strengthen and consolidate development administration From the experiences gathered over the past so many years it has become quite clear that the pace of economic development of the country cannot be intensified until the development administrative machinery is strengthened and made more efficient. In the absence of such an adminis trative structure, the formulation and implementation aspects of the economic development policies and programmes will continue to be weak and incompetent. During the Seventh Plan period, top priority will be given to the task of making development administration more effective. The present organization duties and methods of the government administrative units will be studied in detail, and reformative steps will be taken to make them more capable and dynamic. Improvements will be made in administrative procedures and financial rules to remove the obstacles lying in the way of speedy and smooth implementation of development projects. To boost the morale of the government employees, the pay scales and other facilities applicable to them will be upgraded, and the system of giving rewards strictly on the basis of merit will be enforced. Agencies charged with framing economic and development policies, formulating and assessing development project and programmes, and collecting and processing statistical data will be placed on a firm footing. In order to make it able to mobilize revenue in, an effective manner. tax administration will be made strong and skilled. Steps. will be initiated to make the analysis of the development projects and programmes more effective. To this end, planning cells functioning in ministries of His Majesty\\'s Government, the secretariat of National Planning Commission will be strengthened. ECONOMIC GROWfH RATE AND TARGET During the Sixth Plan period (1980-85), production levels in agricultural and industrial sectors remained impressive. Increase in the agricultural production was satisfactory during the period except in the drought year 1982/83. In the industrial sector, improvement in the supply of electricity contributed to increasing industrial production. Due to these reasons, it appears that over the plan period, GDP will increase on an average by 4.4 percent per year, thus slightly exceeding the overall target of 4.3 percent. But a caution has to be exercised in interpreting this growth rate. It should be borne in mind that the base year 1979/80 of the Sixth Plan was an abnormal year from the point of view of production. Hence, if the growth rate is computed by taking the figures from the following _year 1980/81 onwards, annual average rate of increase of domestic product during four years 1981-85appears to be 3.4 percent. During those four years, productions of agricultural and industrial sectors are estimated to be 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent respectively. Targets of Production, Investment and Savings in the Seventh Plan: In order to achieve the above growth rate, the production of agriculture sector is to be increased by 3.5 percent and the production of non-agriculture sector, by 5.7 percent annually. It would be remarkable if the target annual growth rate of 4.5 percent could be achieved in the context of annual growth rate of mere 3.4 percent in the preceding four years. If these targets were achieved, the-contribution of agriculture sector would fall from 52.4 percent to 49.9, and the contribution of non- agriculture sector would rise from 47.6 percent to 50.1, during the plan period. An investment outlay of Rs 40960 million. is to be provided so as to increase gross domestic product by 4.5 percent. The estimated, outlay is based on the estimate that incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) would be 4.2: 1.0. Out of this total outlay, Rs17550million is estimated to be in govern ment sector and Rs 23410 million, in non- government sector. Out of the amount to be invested in non-government sector Rs 2000 million is estimated to be in panchayat sector and remaining Rs 21410 million is estimated to be in private sector. In case of consumption, its share in GDP is estimated to reach 91.7 by an increment of 5 percent annually from 89.6 percent. For a few years, proportion of national saving seems to be on the decline. By the terminal year of the Sixth Plan i. e. 1984/85, the total population is expected to have reached the mark of 16.69 million. When this is taken into consideration the per capita income during the year has been estimated to have reached Rs 2,525 in 1984/85 at the current price. If population is to grow at the rate of 2.66 percent per annum through Out the Seventh Plan period, the total population is projected to reach 19.03 million by 1989/90, the last year of the plan. If the GDP continues to grow at the targeted annual rate of 4.5 percent throughout the plan period, the per capita income in 1989/90, the final year of the Seventh Plan, is estimated to be Rs 2,760 at 1984/85 constant prices. Hence, the per capita income is estimated to increase at the rate of 1.8 percent annually during the plan period. Development Targets of the Seventh Plan Since the agriculture sector has a decisive role to play in meeting the target of increasing gross domestic product throughout the plan period, top-most priority has been accorded to the development of this sector. Accordingly, targets are set at increasing production of all major agricultural crops by 4.3 percent by increasing the annual production of cereal crops by 4.1 percent and cash crops by 5.2 percent. For achieving these production targets, programmes have been formulated to extend irrigation facilities to additional 235 thousand hectares of land, and to distribute 37 thousand metric tons of improved seeds and 396 thousands metric tons of nutrient chemical fertilisers. Target has been set to distribute agricultural credit amounting to Rs 1504.7 million (net) including Rs 899.6 million through Agricultural Development Bank and Rs 605.1 through Commercial Banks. If irrigation programmes were implemented according to the target, the irrigation facilities to be provided through government sector would increase by 70 percent and this would increase the total land under irrigation facilities to 574 thousand hectares of land at the end of plan period. Another priority sector is forestry. It has been quite essential to conduct forest conservation and development activities in war footing in order to eliminate gradually problems of supply of essential materials like fuel wood and timber and to prevent soil erosion. In this context, it has been targeted to conduct afforestation programme. in an additional 175 thousand hectares of land during the plan period through both government effort and peoples participation. Effort of afforestation would be five times an much in the seventh plan period as compared to the afforestation of only 37 thousand hectares of land in the Sixth Plan period. During the Sixth Plan period, it is estimated that average annual rate of increase of industrial production was 10.3 percent. In the seventh plan period, annual rate of increase in industrial production is estimated to increase at 12.7 percent because of capacity utilisation of industries. already set up in government and private sector, because of commencement of production of industries under construction and because of setting up of new industries. Programme has been set to provide credit of Rs 2560 million in the form.of financial assistance to private sector entrepreneurs to establish industries and to aid in their capacity expansion and regular operation. This also includes Rs 120,million to be distributed through Agricultural Development Bank and an amount Rs 540 million to distribute through commercial banks for the development of cottage & small scale industries. Efforts have to be made for the gradual development of export and tourism sectors in order to lessen in future the dependence on foreign aid as well as to strengthen the balance of payments situation. For this purpose, programmes have been included in. the Seventh Plan. Targets have been set up so as to increase income from export sector by 10.7 percent and number of tourist arrivals by 4 percent annually. , Regarding the transportation sector, total length of road in the year 1984/85 was 5,950 km. and the seventh plan targets to increase its length to a total .of 7,940 .Km. by an increment of 34 percent. In case of the construction of suspension bridges, the number of suspensions bridges constructed in the Sixth Plan was 709 and 373 suspensions bridges are targeted to be constructed during the ensuing plan period. It is targeted to more than double the number of telephone to 40,920 and increase the number of post offices by 34 percent to 2540. In the education sector, it is targeted to increase the proportion of literate population from 28.9percent to 38.9percent till the fiscal year of the plan period. Under adult education programme, a total of 276 thousand adults were made literate during the Sixth Plan period. During the Seventh Plan period, programme has been formulated to make 1.5 million people literate. In the year 1984/85 primary education facilities were made available to 78 percent of children belonging to the age group of 6-10; and lower secondary education facilities were made available to 35 percent of children belonging to the age group of 11-12 and secondary education facilities were made available to 24 percent of the children belonging to the age group of 13-15. It is targeted to enhance the above proportion to 87 percent, 43 percent and 36 percent respectively in 1989/90, the final year of the Seventh Plan. Towards _the development of technical manpower, the target has been set to produce 14,677 students from higher technical schools. Regarding the extension of health services target\\' has been set to increase number of hospitals from 80 to 105, number of hospitals beds from),368 to 4,403 and to increase number of health posts from 794 to 1050. By the end of the Seventh Plan period the facility will be extended to 42.8 percent of the total population including 39.4 percent of rural and 86.5 percent of urban population. With regard to family planning services, during the Sixth Plan period 1.327 million couples were provided with permanent and temporary family plat1lling services. 1 \\tNet loan disbursed to agricultural sector by ADB and Commercial Banks. 2 \\tNet loan disbursed to industrial sector by Agricultural Development Banks, Commercial Banks & Nepal Industrial Development Corporation. 3 \\tOnly the constructions of Suspension Bridge Division. 4 \\tPercentage of literate population above 6 years of age out of total population. Allocation of Total Development-Outlay Though the amount to be invested in the public sector is Rs17.55 billion, total development outlay will be Rs 29 billion. Direct development outlay in the public sector will be Rs 27 billion as Rs 1 billion each will be provided to Private Sector and Panchayat Sector. Of this total development outlay, 65 percent is estimated to be spent in the form of investment. Total development outlay during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be Rs 50.41 billion, including direct development outlay of Rs 27 billion in the Public Sector, investment of Rs 2 billion in Panchayat sector and investment of 21.47 billion in private sector. Total development outlay is estimated to be allocated to social and economic sectors in public, panchayat and private sectors as follows: 1. Includes construction of houses and other miscellaneous development expenditures. 2. Includes Rs 1000 million development assistance from His Majesty\\'s Government to Panchayats. 3. Includes total financial assistance Rs 1000 million that is to be distributed by HMG through financial institutions and commercial banks to private sector which includes an amount of Rs 250 million each for industry and cottage as well as small scale industries and Rs 1500 million for the development of agriculture. District level development pro - grammes that have been conducted by HMG will be formulated and imple mented through District Panchayats. Besides this, financial assistance of Rs I billion will be made available from HMG in five years as grants to Districts Panchayats for local development programmes. An amount of Rs 1003 minion is estimated to be mobilized by panchayats by implementing Panchayats Development and Land Tax and mobilizing local lobour and resources from local taxes panchayat are authorised to collect by such laws. In this way, an outlay of Rs 2 billion is expected to be made available to the panchayat sector. His Majesty\\'s Government will provide Rs 500 million and Rs 250 million respectively to Agriculture Development Bank and Nepal Industrial Development Corporation in order to \\'provide financial assistance to private sector entrepreneurs to provide support for increasing investment in agriculture & industry. Besides this, refinance amounting to Rs 250 million will be provided by HMG through commercial banks for the development of cottage and small scale industries in the private sector. Balance amount of Rs 2l.10 million needed for the investment in private sector is estimated to be met from the savings \\'of the private sector. Investment in the private sector includes the investment to be done by. Government Corporation from their own savings also. Projection of Balance of Payments Situation The tendencies that were observed in the balance of trade and pay ment situation during the Sixth Plan period were as follows: (1) \\tExport could not increase in proportion to the increase in GDP. (2) \\tThe decisive role played by weather in the export trade has remained as it is because of the dominance of agriculture and agro-based commodities in total volume of trade, (3) \\tThough there has been some change in commodity-wise cons titution of export trade due to increase in the proportion of industrial goods, stability has yet to be imparted to export by improving quality, production & cost of production of such goods. (4) \\tBalance of trade continued to be unfavourable due to the increasing proportion of import in GDP. (5) \\tIncome from tourism sector has not been able to improve balance of payments situation. (6) \\tThe deteriorating balance of payments situation with overseas countries has a tendency to, affect the balance of payments situation with  due to an increment in imparts from that country. In the first year (1980/81) o,f the Sixth Plan, export increased abnormally by 38 percent due to, favourable climate over the unfavourable are in the. previous year. Improvement in. the export could occur after 1983/8.4. But .this improvement was due only to, the increase in valuation price in Nepalese- Rupees in. export statistics as a result of gradual devaluation of Nepalese currency in relation to, U. S. Dollar and inflation in the International Market. There is no, increase in the quantity of export and bas remained stable over the last 7 or 8 years. This kind. of status qua is estimated to persist even during the Seventh Plan period. As. such, during the Seventh Plan period effort has to be done to increase export at a rate of 2. 5 percent per annum at constant price. A total amount of Rs 11640 million will be accrued from export if the estimated increase in exports were achieved. Impart is estimated to, increase tremendously during the Seventh Plan period. To, contains the rate of import within an annual rate of 6 percent at constant price, measures to, adopt are suitable exchange rate, appropriate fiscal and monetary policy, and to, central impart of luxurious goods. If this increasing rate of import can be limited to, 6 percent, remittances for impart could be contained to, Rs 44640 million. in. the plan period. The total trade deficit during the plan period will still be Rs 33000 million. Tourism has remained a principal source of service income of foreign exchange and Indian currency, But during the Sixth Plan period, though number of tourists has increased, a decline is recorded in its income. This supports the fact that there is a leakage in foreign exchange earning from tourism. As such, it will be essential to, pay attention to check these leakages. Special steps will have to, be taken to, make programmes of tourism promotion effective to, increase earnings from this sector. During the plan period, income from. tourism sector is estimated at Rs 4620 million by increasing earnings at the rate of 4 percent pe r annum. Other source of service income included during the Seventh Plan period was local expenditure of diplomatic missions in  Since the constructions of big buildings i.e. \\'Works of high. cast of diplomatic missions have been completed, now it cannot be expected that there will be further increase in this amount. Therefore, during the Seventh Plan period, income from other service is estimated to increase at a rate of 6.2 percent per annum; making the total amount Rs 12920 million. Service payment is estimated to increase at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum making the total payment Rs 6450 million. In this way, net earning from. service income is estimated to be Rs; l1090 million. During the Seventh Plan period, it is estimated that there will be a rapid increase in payment of interest on foreign loans and at the final year of the plan, annual payment amount will be Rs 330 million. Since investment income is estimated to be Rs 500 millions, net payment during the plan period\\' is estimated to be Rs 670 million. Transfer income will increase at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum and transfer payment will increase at a rate of 10 percent per annum by bringing in an amount of Rs 3940 million net total income from this sector. Transfer income mainly includes remittance received from Nepalese working in foreign countries and transfer payment mainly includes income that foreign contractors send to their countries through earning in . This was estimated to be Rs 2840 million at the final year 1984/85 of the Sixth Plan. Total deficit amount of current account during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be Rs 18640 million. During the Seventh Plan period, the total foreign aid that will be received is estimated to be Rs 20480 million including grant assistance of Rs 10400 million and loan assistance of Rs 10080 million. As principal to be paid during the period will be Rs 820 millions, net foreign aid to be recovered will be Rs 19660 million. Tl.1is amount will enable to meet the deficit of Rs 18640 million of current account making it surplus of Rs l020 million in balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserve in Nepal Rastra Bank seems to be increased by Rs I billion by the fiscal year 1989/90 so as to meet import expenditure of at least four months. As such, balance of payment surplus of Rs I billion is essential during the plan period. Favourable or unfavourable balance of payment position in the Seventh Plan period depends mainly on whether or not income from export & tourism could be increased by 2.5 percent per annum and 4 percent per annum respectively and whether or not the rate of increase of import could be contained at 6 percent per annum. These growth rates are projected at constant price of 1984/85. Since price rise is estimated to: be 8 percent per annum, export & tourism earnings at current price have to be increased at annual rate of 10.7 percent and 12.3 percent respectively, and an annual rate of increase of import have to be contained at 14.5 percent. If these could not be done, hurdles will appear in development process due to balance of payment crisis. CHAPTER 4 PUBLIC SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND PROVISION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES Since the beginning of the Sixth Plan, scarcity of domestic resources has emerged as a main obstacle in expanding the public sector investment programmes. The amount of revenue surplus necessary for financing development expenditures had been on the decline due to the fast expansion of regular expenditures on the one hand and the failure of revenue growth rates to surpass the regular expenditure on the other. If this trend of revenue earnings and regular expenditures is to persist, the surplus is bound to become negative in the Seventh Plan. Because of the difficult government finance situation, the growth rate of development expenditures has been nominal since the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, and even has decreased in terms of constant prices. Size of Development Outlay and Sources of Finance In the context of the emerging financial situation, the size of the public sector development outlay has been limited to Rs 29 billion for the Seventh Plan Period. Firstly, the presently apparent indications of the slow growth rate of revenue generation points out the failure to take timely corrective measures in accelerating the growth of revenue generation. Though corrective measures have been taken presently, many years will have to be spent before the results are expected from these measures, and hence a significant achievement cannot be expected in the plan period. With the increase in the number of completed projects along with their cost of repair and - maintenance in regular expenditure is not unnatural It is essential to make adequate provisions for repair and maintenance. But it is not the only cause for the increase in the regular expenditure. Regular budget has not made adequate provisions for the repair and maintenance of projects, and implementation and maintenance cost of many regular works have been met from development budget. Specially due to the raise in the salary scales towards the end of the(Sixth)Plan period, the administrative expenses have been enormous and it will be difficult to check the increase of regular expenditure if the trend of overstaffing continues. Unless efforts are made to install cost-effective administrative machinery it will be very difficult to check this increase. Another cause for this increase in regular expenditure is the increasing burden of loan and interest repayment of domestic and external loans. In the Seventh Plan period, this kind of expenses is estimated to be Rs 4.79 billion at constant prices, which amounts to 25 percent of estimated total regular expenditure. Due to all these causes, immense cut in the regular expenditure is unlikely in the Seventh Plan period The third reason that necessitated to curtail the size of development outlay is the inability of the economy to utilise all available foreign aid. Though emphasis has been laid from time to time to enhance absorptive capacity, we have not succeeded enough in this front. As it will be unrealistic to seek the use of foreign aid beyond the absorptive capacity, the size of development expenditure has been limited from this view point also. In determining the size of development expenditure of Rs 29, billion for the Seventh Plan, it has been assumed that appropriate measures will be taken in these three areas-mobilisation of revenue, control of regular expenditure and improvement in the absorptive capacity. It has been estimated that Rs 22.06 billion at constant prices will be collected as revenue during the plan period assuming the average annual growth rate of revenue to be 4.4 percent due to the expansion of economic activities in the Seventh Plan period. The regular expenditure will grow annually by 7.1 Jpercent and will amount to Rs 18.79 billion. Thus the revenue surplus of Rs 3.09 billion will be available to meet development expenditures. It has been projected that Rs 20 48 billion of foreign aid would be utilized as a result of the gradual strengthening of the development administration. In terms of resources, Rs 2.57 billion will be available from these two sources, thus constituting 81.3 percent of total development expenditure of Rs 29 billIon. Deficit of Rs 5.43 billion (18.7 percent of development expendiure) has to be mobilised through the proper combination of measures like mobilisation of additional revenue and raising of internal loan. As a result, country\\'s balance of payments position and domestic prices deteriorated, culminating in serious economic difficulties. Efforts have been made to curtail th_ amount of deficit finance since 1983/84, but without any success and the cut in deficit financing has been at the cost of development expenditure. Greater reliance cannot be placed on internal loan due to three reasons. First, loan mostly from the banking sector has an expansionary effect on the money supply and adversely affects the domestic and external economic balance. Second since this measure calls for competition with private sector for financial resources, it goes contrary to the objective of the plan to encourge private sector participation in economic development. Third, tax revenue and loan have different impact on the budget. The tax revenue has not to be refunded whereas the amount mobilised from loan has. to be paid back along with interest. Keeping in view the increasing burden of debt services in the regular budget, financing through loans should be viewed only as a temporary measure to meet short term financial needs. Even at present the annual amount of internal loan that the government raises is very high compared to the annual revenue (It is estimated to be 35 percent in 1984/85). Keeping this in view policies of permanent nature in mq.bilising additional revenue and ,in gradually lessening reliance on internal loan are to be adopted to meet the deficit of the development outlys in the Seventh Plan. Accordingly, Rs 1.93 billion will be realised by changes in the tax policies and by strengthening the tax administration and the balance amount of Rs 3.50 billion to be raised in the form of internal loans. Proposed loan amount for the Seventh Plan is to be very minimal in comparision with such loan raised during the Sixth Plan period. Of the proposed loan amount, Rs 2.50 billion will be raised from the banking sector and Rs 1.00 billion from non-banking sectors. According to the forecast, development outlays will increase only by I . Thus only Rs 0.50 billion will be an increment ip. the development outlay within the five years of the Plan. Main reasons for die need to limit the development outlays are due to the need to meet increasing regular experditure from the additional revenue generated from regular growth and from new measures and due to the necessity of gradually curtailing the amount of internal loan. Another signlicant change in the financial position that the forecast indicated is the growth of foreign aid component from 61 to 70 percent in the plan period and the need to allocate significant part of additional scarde internal resources to meet the additional HMG contribution to utilise this foreign aid (on the supposition that the proportion of HMG contribution for the utilisation of foreign aid is 1.00 = 0.22). As such development programmes to be implemented from HMG\\'s own resources have to be curtailed Mobilisation of Internal resources Great efforts have to be made for the mobilisation of additional resources to meet the deficit internal resources for the public sector development outlay in the Seventh Plan. Specifically following measures have to be adopted: The base of the tax revenue is very narrow. Custom duties collected on the imported goods and sales tax have remained the main source of revenue. As tax revenue is mainly dependent on imports, it has made it difficult to remodel the import policy suitable to the country\\'s economic development and to frame a firm revenue structure. It is necessary to be less reliant on this source of revenue as there is a need to control the imports in the Seventh Plan period. Therefore, a need to explore alternative sources of revenue to enhance the level of internal, resources is more clearly felt. To moblilse more resources from agricultural sector, measures like revision of the rates and of structure of rent the identification of appropriate medium of direct tax on the agricultural income are necessary. Income tax from non-agricultural sector also has been systematically collected. Base of income tax has eroded because of weak tax administration and many concessions allowed thereto. After a thorough review of present tax structure, institution of low rates of income taxes with minimum of tax concessions in lieu of high rates will probably help reduce tax evasion and tax leakages too. Revenue collected from urban land holdings and housing properties is also limited. The main reasons for this are the concessions granted to the industries and hotels, the higher rates of such concessions, inability to update the assessment of land holding and housing properties and lack of strict follow up to collect such taxes after identification of evaders of such taxes. The base of indirect taxes like excise imposed on domestic production and sales tax is also narrow. Main sources of indirect tax revenue has been alcohol and cigarettes. Elasticity of tax revenue to national income is very low at present. Due to this reason, the increase in national income has not adequately been reflected in the generation of revenue. To enhance the elasticity of tax revenue, measures to replace -existing taxes rates based on quantity by advaloren taxes, wherever possible, can contribute to the increase in resource mobilisation. It is high time now to take steps to assess contributions to the revenue from these industries also, based on revision of tax facilities these industries are enjoying in accordance with the policy of industrial promotion. Additionally new sources of revenue should be identified. Sales taxes can be levied on the services offered by corporations like telephone, telecommunication, electricity, drinking water. It is necessary to determine appropriate rates of duty for the services charging low rates at present after the reassessment of such duties. Revamping of tax administration has been the priority issue for the .effective collection of revenue. Institutional and professional development of revenue administration should immediately be taken up. Only by doing so, system of revenue collection can be made effective and leakages, checked. There are still additional measures to be adopted to tap the net profit of the government owned-corporations and thereby, enhance their contribution level to government revenue. Despite steps undertaken to run these public corporations professionally and efficiently, it is now time that concrete measures be introduced to enhance their level of efficiency. It has become difficult to finance for additional development outlays as government failed to realise adequate returns from investment need in different sectors. The revenue collected from different services like irrigation, mini- hydel plants, transportation, drinking water projects, sewage, higher education, hospitals is not even enough to meet the cost of repair and maintenance, let alone the recovery of such investment. To continue further investment in the development of such sectors demand changes in this situation. For this, fixation of appropriate duties and their effective collection must be insured. In addition to above measures to achieve higher level mobilisation of resources, measures also must be taken to restrain the growth of regular expenditure. Specific control should be exercised on the recruitment of extra personnel in the government offices than these are absolutely necessary. Measures also should be adopted to close down or integrate unnecessary offices after the detailed study of work volume of each of these. Subsidy policies should also be reviewed and the budget releived of the pressure emerging from the increasing subsidies provided in the distribution of foodgrains and chemical fertilizers. In case the measures cited above for the mobilisation of resources and control of regular expenditure are not taken up in time, a great difficulty in the adequately mobilisation of internal resources would render the meeting of the targeted amount of outlay for the government sector extremely difficult. Utilization of foreign aid No specific imp rovement in the utilization of foreign aid seemed to have been brought about in the Sixth Plan period. Only 39 percent of total available foreign aid was utilized in that period. As of July 15,1985, balance of unutilized foreign aid including grants and loans amount to Rs 19.72 billion. Though a sharp increase in the foreign aid is unlikely due to the unfavourable international aid climate, it is expected that foreign aid to the tune of Rs 23.15 billion will be available for the Seventh Plan period. This is at the rate of Rs 4.63 billion annually at constant price of 1984/85. Thus it is estimated that the total foreign aid of Rs 4.87 billion together with the amount as of July 15,1985 and those to be available in the plan period will represent the total fund that should be utilized in the Seventh Plan. Thus, our problem lies not in the exploration of further aid but in failure to effectively use foreign aid already available. If the past experience of the Sixth Plan is any guide to future, it is doubtful wheter or not even 40 percent of available foreign aid could be spent. The requirements of foreign aid utilization in the Seventh Plan, however, is based on the estimate that 50. I percent of foreign aid or Rs 20.48 billion would be utilised. Unless there is a substantial improvement in our absorptive capacity, it will be very difficult to utilize foreign aid. As such concrete steps should be taken towards the solution of present obstacles (like delay in the approval of tender, weaknesses in administrative management and coordination, and impractical financial rules and regulations etc.) to enhance the absorptive capacity. In order to enhance the foreign aid utilization and to boost up production without loss of time, a substantive portion of foreign aid that will be available in the Seventh Plan should be channeIlised towards activities directly contributing to the increase in production. This approach will greatly aid in the speedy utilization of foreign aid and in attaining the objective of increasing production and of meeting the minimum 8 basic needs of people. Appropriation and Allocation of Development Expenditure As a great stride is unlikely in overcoming the scarcity of internal resources and in boosting the absorptive capacity, size of development expenditure for the Seventh Plan period cannot be increased immensely; Therefore, development expenditure has been limited to Rs 29 billion. At constant prices, development expenditure had shrunk to Rs 5.50 billion in the fourth and fifth year of the Sixth Plan. In context of total expenditure of Rs 25.33 billion during the Sixth Plan, the proposed development outlay of Rs 29 billion is bigger by only 14 percent at the constant price of 1984/85. Development expenditure is estimated to increase by 1 .8 percent annually during the plan .period. According to the estimates, development expenditure has increased by 8 percent in the Sixth Plan period at constant price of 1984/85. As the size of development expenditure cannot be increased beyond Rs 29 billion, the following investment policies should be adopted while allocating of development expenditure in the Seventh Plan. 1. To allocate resources to priority projects under construction for their early completion. 2. To chalk, out non-priority projects from the plan itself after reassessment of the projects programmes under implementation. 3. To take up new projects to the extent the surplus resources permit after allocating resources for the completion of projects under implementation. 4. While taking up new projects, to give first priority to projects and programmes that are helpful for the fuller utilisation of infrastructures already created with minimum of investment, thereby contributing to the increase in production and to place second priority to projects and programmes that will enhance production and help meet minimum basic needs as envisaged in the plan. Adequate statistics and materials have not been available to formulate five years programme in accordance with above policies. As such, efforts have been made to provide guidelines on the priority allocation to public sector investment programmes of different sectors according to the objectives of the Seventh Plan. At the time of formulation of annual development plan and budget preparation, practice of incorporating projects and programmes in the annual plan only after their detailed analysis will be pursued. In allocation of resources for public sector in the Seventh Plan, policy of allocating more resources to priority sectors will be adopted. Accordingly priority will be assigned to and more resources allocated for the development of agriculture, irrigation and forest sectors. For this sector, 30.6 percent of total development outlay has been earmarked. Emphasis has been laid on the development especially of cottage and small scale industries in the context of the industrial development. In power, emphasis has been laid on the completion of Marshyangdi hydro-electricity project, and on the extension of the transmission lines. For the social service and miscellaneous sectors 25.7 percent of the development outlay has been earmarked. In the social service sector, priority has been assigned to primary education, adult education, vocational and technical education, drinking water and basic health services. Emphasis has been placed on the qualitative rather than quantity on services in the development of education and health services. For the development of transport and communication, 17.7 percent of development outlay has been earmarked. In transportation, emphasis is placed on the completion of remaining part of western sector of East-West highway and on the construction of projects like suspension bridges to facilitate services of transportation. Of the development outlay of Rs 29 billion, amounts have been set aside to provide refinance of Rs 500 million for 19ricultural Development Bank and Rs 250 million for Nepal Industrial Development Corporation to assist private farmers and entrepreneurs for agricultural and industrial development, and of Rs 250 million to Commercial Banks for the development of cottage and small scale industries. CHAPTER 5 PROVISION OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS Introduction Construction Materials like cement, iron steel goods, bricks and development materials like pipes, petroleum products, coke & coal and chemical fertilizers play an important role in the development & construction projects. As such, an attempt has been made to estimate quantity, cost of construction & development materials and study supply provisions of these materials while formulating periodic plan. The Sixth Plan had emphasized the promotion of the domestic production of such construction and development materials, economising the use of imported materials and the research in the use of local materials in the Hill areas. Hetauda Cement Factory has reached the phase of trial production and capacity expansion of Himal Cement Factory is underway. If the production of iron rods has increased from industries of the Eastern and Central Development Regions, production of polythene pipes and corrugated sheets necessary for the construction of school and hospital buildings has commenced in the Sixth Plan Period. However, the proposed Arc Furnace in Parwanipur and Fused Magnesium Phosphate (F.M.P.). Fertilized factory in Kharidhunga could not be materialized in the plan period. Basic construction and development materials like cement, iron and steel goods, bricks, timber, polythene pipe, petroleum products, coke and coal, chemical fertilizers, paper, news print and explosives have been include& in projection of basic materials needed for the Seventh Plan. At the conclusion of the Seventh Plan, 63.9 percent of cement, 16 percent of iron rods, almost 100 percent of bricks, timber, polythene pipes, paper are estimated to be supplied from internal production, but cent percent of petroleum products, chemical fertilizers, newsprints, coke& coal, have to be imported. Objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan regarding supply of development & construction materials will be as follows: 2. Objective (i) \\tTo make supply system of development & construction materials effective. (ii) \\tTo be less dependent on imported materials, continued efforts will be made to replace imports by domestic production by establishing industries that are feasible and that are based on local raw materials. 3. Polices (i) \\tTo emphasize the full capacity utilization of industries producing construction materials. (ii) \\tTo adopt appropriate tax and import policies so as to encourage private sector in the import of construction materials, if in cases where there already is not an institutional unit specialising on the import of such materials. (iii) \\tTo adopt appropriate policies to\" promote the\\' domestic production of \\tconstruction materials. (iv) \\tTo emphasize on research towards production and improvements in the quality and techniques of use of local materials so as to encourage maximum use of local materials like stones, slates, lime, timber in the hill and remote areas inaccessible by modern transport, and (v) \\tTo emphasize on the up-date monitoring, by concerned institutions on balancing demand and supply situation of materials neces sary for the implementation of development and construction projects in each Development Region and on planning the supply, distribution and storage system of development and construction materials accordingly. 4. Demand and Supply Estimates of Materials It is estimated that 2,507,200 M. tons of cement will be required for the construction works in the public and private sectors during the Seventh Plan. Out of this 60 percent of 1,504,320 M. tons of cement is estimated for different development projects in the public sector and the rest for the private sector. If the Chobhar and Hetauda Cement Factories in the Central Development Region manufacture according to their capacity 1,602,200 M. ton of cement (63.9 percent of total estimated demand) will be supplied from within the country. Feasibility studies will be conducted for setting up of Cement Factories in other Development Regions also. The estimated requirement of iron -and steel materials like iron rods, strip steel, plates, sheets, sectional steel is _estimated to be 410,178 M. tons in the Seventh Plan period. Of the estimated requirement 267,769 M.ton (65 percent) is estimated to be consumed by public sector and the remaining 142,409 M. ton (35 percent) by the corporate and private sector. At present, the total annual capacity of industries producing iron rods is 11,500 M. ton. In addition to the capacity expansion of these industries, feasibility of iron industry based on local iron deposits will be reconsidered. 3. Bricks Thirty percent or 740million pieces of bricks and seventy percent or 1730 million pieces are estimated to be required for the public sector and private sector work respectively. Though all demand for bricks are met from domestic production, brick manufactures have not been able to produce the demand due to the scarcity of fuelwood and due to the difficulties in the import of coke and coal. In the Seventh Plan period, efforts will be made to overcome these difficulties 4. Timber Requirement of timber is projected to be 625,638 cu. meter in the Seventh Plan. Out of this 125,128 cumetre of timber (20 percent) is estimated to be expended in public sector works and the remaining 500,510 cu. meter, (80 percent) for corporate and private sector works. Supply of timber is being met from the fore sts within the country. In addition to the demand for timber, demand for fuelwood is also increasing, as a result of which forest acreage is on the decline, affecting the supply of timber, Emphasis will be laid as such on the development of forests. 5. Polythene Pipes As Seventh Plan has laid emphasis on expansion of drinking water facilities demand for polythene pipes is estimated to be around 8,300 M. tons. Of these, 7,055 M. ton (85 percent) and the remaining 1,245 M. too are estimated to be expended in the public sector and private sector respec tively. As production from industries in Balaju, Dharan and Kalaiya will meet above requirements it does not seem necessary to import polythene pipes. 6. Chemical Fertilizer The total requirement of Chemical Fertilizers is estimated to be 426,500 M. tons of nutrients in the Seventh Plan. Of the required nutrients, more than 95 percent will be needed for the private sector and the rest will be expended in the Government agricultural farms. As all requirements of chemical fertilizers are met from imports, emphasis will be placed on application and promotion of .local organic fertilizers and studies will be conducted as to assess the feasibility of chemical fertilizer industry to gradually reduce the dependence on imports. 7. Mineral Oil Products Under mineral oil products are included petroleum products like petroleum, high speed diesel, kerosene, furnace oil, aviation fuel, light diesel, light petroleum gas etc. These petroleum products are necessary for different sectors from day to day transport services to construction works, agriculture, industries etc. Though oil prospecting and exploration works are being conducted in the country, it will take several years before an oil prospect is identified, explored and drilled for oil production.. So the country has to depend on imports for all these petroleum products in the plan period. In the Seventh Plan Period, a total of 826,013 M. tons of petroleum products is estimated to be required for public and private sectors as presented below. 8. Coke and ,Coal Coke and Coal are beginning to replace the role of fuelwood in the domestic and industrial fuels. Especially in the, border areas where fuelwood is beginning to be s carce coal has, been the alternative source of fuel. With the establishme nt of new industries requirements of coal and coke has increased tremendously. In the Seventh Plan period, 743,712 M. tons of coke and coal might be required. As there are no good coal deposits in the country, all requirements of coke and coal except some lignite are met from imports.- With the increase in the price of oil, price of coke and coal has also increased. Emphasis will be laid in the Seventh Plan on the institutional set up to regularise imports and supply of coal under long term contractual agreement, 9. Writing and Printing Paper The maximum requirement of writing and printing paper in the Seventh Plan period is estimated at 75,768 M. tons. Part of this requirement will be met from the production of Bhrikuti Paper Factory in Nawal Parasi. Additionally the commissioning of Nepalgunj Paper Factory, will add to the domestic supply. But to meet the total requirements of paper in the plan period the country will still have to depend mainly on import. Of the quantities of writing and printing paper, it is estimated that 50 percent will be required for the public sector, and 50 percent for the private sector. 10. Newsprint Of this, 4,612 M. ton (75 percent) will be consumed in the public sector, and the rest 1,537 M. ton (25 percent), in the private sector. 11. Explosives It is estimated that 7,755 M. ton of gelatin, 5,940,750 detonators, and 8,400,375 metres of fuse wire will be required in the Seventh Plan Period. More than 97 percent of this requirement will be consumed by the construction works in the public sector and the rest by the private stone quarry workers. 5. Provision of Materials As a separate Ministry of Supplies has been set up, projection and supply of development and construction materials except the explosives has been the explosives has been the responsibility of this Ministry. Among the development and construction materials, supply and distribution of cement, iron and steel goods, writing and printing paper and newsprint are managed by the National Trading Ltd. and private traders; timber by the Timber Corporation of Nepal; Mineral oil products by Nepal Oil Corporation; and chemical fertilizers by the Agricultural The liberal approach will be adopted to encourage private traders to import cement, iron and steel goods, coke and coal. All requirements of Coke and Coal in the public sector will be met by institutional import arrangements under long term contractual agreements. Among development and construction materials that will be made available under quota allotments from  and under aid-in-kind from other countries, the policy will be to assign Agricultural Inputs Corporation to import. Different development and construction materials that will be needed (or the Seventh Plan are listed in the table below. It is estimated that the cost of these materials will be 19 billion and 360 million rupees at the constant price of fiscal year 2041/42. It is estimated that only for the petro leum products, the cost will be Rs 3 billion and Rs 700 million. CHAPTER 6 PROVISION OF TECHNICAL MANPOWER 1. Background As skilled and trained manpower is essential for effective implementation of periodic development plans of the country the provision manpower is utmost necessary. In fact, quantitative as well as qualitative growth manpower is quite necessary as is the growth in financial investment for the achievement of the plan targets. At present, lack of trained administrative personnels and technicians has been a great obstacle in the speedy use of investments in the country. As a result of previous years\\' efforts, there has been a good deal of success in increasing supply of medium, and basic level technicians to some extent, yet high level technicians are still estimated to be in short supply, Non-availability of required labour force in the market on the one hand and inability in mobilizing basic level technicians of local villages effectively for lack of trainings on the other are among main reasons that are hampering the supply of manpower in accordance with the need for the effective implementation of the programmes as set in the plan. Similarly lack of effective management in providing internal and foreign training to personnel as needed is also hampering the supply of required manpower. Since it takes along time to produce such technicians, it may adversely effect the implementation of periodic development plans in future. Hence, efforts are to be made further for extending various educational facilities, in the country and for the management of many more scholarships for higher education board so as to increase the supply of manpower in the deficit areas. But the revised supply situation is estimated to be 30,674 persons only, thereby being shortfall 8788 persons. In this way, a shortage of 8788 technical personnels is estimated by the end of Sixth Plan whereas by the end of the Fifth Plan whereas by the end of the Fifth Plan it was only 4,893 persons. 2. Objectives In view of development objectives of the Seventh Plan, the objectives of manpower planning has been set as follows: a. To utilize the available technical manpower to the maximum b. To maximize productivity and employment prospects of technical manpower. c. To strike out a balance by removing disparities between demand and supply of manpower. 3. Policies Following policies shall be adopted to meet those objectives: a. To determine the number of students’ enrollment in technical institutes in accordance with the projected demanded projection for technical manpower, b. To extend capacities of technical institutes and if found necessary, establish new additional institutes so to enhance quantitative as well as qualitative level, c. To obtain more scholarships from abroad and send people for training and study abroad so as to increase supply of particular type of high level technicians. d. To extensively conduct appropriate formal and informal training in the country to meet the shortage of medium and basic level manpower and to make necessary arrangement for the mobilization of basic level local skills by making them more efficient , e. To help mobilization and utilization of technical manpower by means of modification in their career development, benefits, facilities, and recruitment procedures etc. f. To ensure the employment of technicians in related fields in which they have got training or have studied, and g. To secure of foreign advisors only in those areas where Nepalese national are not available, 5. Classification and Level of Manpower Technical personnels for the implementation of manpower development schemes for the Seventh Plan are divided into five sectors which are as follows: (1) Engineering (2) Health (3) Agriculture (4) Forestry & (5) Scientist and Technicians. Those technical personnels- are divided into three levels (1) High Level (2) Medium Level and (3) Basic Level. High level includes all gazetted officials of His Majesty\\'s Government and similar other officials; Medium level, all non-gazetted 1st class and similar other personnel and Basic level the non-gazetted 2nd class or similar other officials. Out of these, Engineering sector is further classified into four sub-sectors namely Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and others; Health sector is reclassified into seven sub-sectors in the high level namely Doctor; Nurses, Radiography, Pharmacy, Ayurved etc, eight sub-sectors in the high level and sub-sector in the basic level. Similarly the Agricultural Sectors has been broken into three sub-sectors namely Agricultural Sciences, Animal Sciences & other. General Forestry, Forest Research , Soil and Water Conservation, Wild life and others in High Level and Rangers. Lab Technicians, Saw Miller, Loggers and allied in the Medium Level and Basic level are separately classified under the  sector. But Scientists and Technicians are not further divided into any sub sector since that sector covers a lot of subjects. 6. Demand for manpower Since more programs will be launched with more investments in the Seventh Plan that in the Sixth Plan, it is clear that the demand for manpower required for the public sector during the Seventh Plan period is made. In Engineering sector, it is estimated that there will be total stock of 12667 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85. The total demand projection for the Seventh Plan in this sector is estimated to be 7880 persons among whom 2827 persons were taken as shortfall during the Sixth Plan and 5053 persons as additional requirements for the Seventh Plan. Thus keeping in view the pattern of plan investments and on past experience, the total estimated personnel required by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 is projected to be 20547. The present projection shows that the demand for the all level of technical manpower will increase remarkably as in the past. During the Seventh Plan period demand for civil engineers at the high level is prominent but the same for medium and basic level technicians will increase in all categories. The demand projection for Engineering sector manpower is shown in Table 1. In Health, 5588 persons are the total estimated stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85. The total demand projection for the sector during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 3502 persons. During the Seventh Plan while demand for doctors is note worthy at the high level, demand for staff nurses, health assistant radiographers, pharmacists and lab technicians will be prominent at the medium level. The demand projection for Health sector manpower is shown in Table No. In forest manpower, the total estimated stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 seems to be 2372 persons. Deficit of forest manpower during the sixth plan period, were 204 persons at high and medium level, while there was surplus of 180 people at the basic level. Thus in this sector, the total deficit of 24 persons during the Sixth Plan along with the additional requirements of 649 persons during the Seventh Plan totals to 673 persons as total demand projections for the Seventh Plan period. The total stock of the sixth plan along with the total demand projections of the Seventh Plan makes the total 3045 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90. As in other sectors there will be remarkable increase of demand for manpower in this sector also General forestry at the high level and forest ranger at the medium level will be remarkable in this increase in demand. The demand projection for forest sector manpower is shown in Table No. 4. In Scientists and Technical manpower, there will be a total stock of 2696 persons with a deficit of 174 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85. Demand for the basic level manpower will be more than the demand for manpower at other level. The demand projection for Scientists and Technicians is shown in Table No. 5. As mentioned above, there will be a total stock of 30,647 technical persons in all of the five sectors by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85. Among the projected figure, the highest demand 9110 persons at the basic level, while the required medium and high level manpower are 7867 and 3881 respectively. Similarly, the total estimate required positions by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 at the high, medium, and basic levels are 9207, 17890 and 24435 respectively making a total requirements of 51531. The demand projection for total manpower is shown in Table No. 6. 7. Supply of Manpower The supply projection of manpower for the Seventh Plan rely upon the supply from the outcome of the educational institutions and technical institutions under  of the country along with the arrivals of those who have returned from the abroad after completing the study and enrolled in the public sector during the plan period. The estimates of promotion of manpower to the higher post are also made and thus included in the projection of internal supply. During the Seventh Plan period the supply from the internal production and that from the returnees from abroad after completing the study are estimated to be 4,265 persons and 536 persons respectively making a total supply of 4,801 by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90. Civil engineers will be the highest supply among the productions from the educational institutions in the country during the plan period. Similarly civil engineers also seem to be the highest among the returnees from abroad. The supply projection of Engineering manpower is given in Table No.7. During the Seventh Plan period the supply from the internal production and that from the returnees from abroad after completing the study are estimated to be 2,282 persons and 168 persons respectively making a total supply of 2,450 persons. In medium and low level, almost all types of personnels are expected to be supplied equally from the internal source. Only high level technicians are supposed to be the returnees from abroad and among them M. B. B. S. doctor will be the main in number. The supply projection of Health manpower is given in Table No.8. During the Seventh Plan period the number of outcome from the internal supply and returnees from abroad after completing the study is expected to be 3,458 persons and 550 persons respectively making a total supply of 4,008 persons. According to the projection, Agricultural Science seems to be the highest in number among the total outcome of the country as well as among the returnees from abroad. Similarly, supply of all the medium and basic level manpower are estimated to be met internally. During the Seventh plan period the internal supply from the educational institutions in the country and the returnees after completing study from abroad are estimated to be 832 persons and 114 persons respectively making a total supply of 946 persons. The numbers of enrollment in the public sector among the total productions from educational institutions of the country during the Seventh Plan are estimated to be 1,267 persons thereby making a total stock of 3,963 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90. According to the projection, the highest number of enrollment in the public sector among the production from educational institutions comes to the order of Basic, Medium and High level technicians. The supply projection of Scientist and Technical manpower is shown in Table No. 11. As mentioned above, the total stock of technical manpower in all the five sectors by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 is estimated to be 30,674 persons. During the Seventh Plan period the total internal supplies from the educational institutions and the returnees from abroad after completing their study is estimated to be 12,104 persons and 1,368 persons respectively making a total supply of 13,472 persons. Among the internal supplies, while the highest number consist in the basic level having 5,732 persons, the supply in medium level is estimated to be 5,085 persons. But there will be internal supply of 1,287 persons only in the high level. Similarly, the returnees from abroad after completing study will be only in the high level. In this way, the total stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 is estimated to be 30,674 persons and this figure along with the additional supply of 13.472 persons during the Seventh Plan makes the total estimated stock of 44,146 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90. The supply projection of total manpower is shown in Table No. 12. 8. Demand and Supply Position According to the information stated above the demand and supply of Engineering Manpower during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 7,880 persons and 4,801 persons respectively, the shortage being 3,079 persons thereby. In this sector, Doctors are the main area of shortage in high level and in medium and basic level shortage is estimated in almost all areas. During the sixth plan, there was an estimation of 71 and 442 persons as deficit in high and basic level respectively but with a surplus of 1,380 persons in the medium level making the total surplus of 867 persons thereby. The main reason behind the estimation of the shortage of 538 persons in middle level during the Seventh Plan in spite of estimated surplus of 1380 persons during the sixth plan is due to the increase in demand in middle level in the sixth plan with a sufficient supply thereby making a shortfall of 585 persons during that period and non-supply of manpower in the Seventh Plan also in accordance with the need. The demand and supply position of Health manpower is presented in Table No. 14. In Agricultural manpower, the total demand and supply during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 7,140 persons and 4,008 persons respectively making a total shortage of 3,132 persons. Out of the total shortages the highest shortage is 1,447 persons in middle level followed by 1,280 persons in basic level and 405 persons in high level. Agricultural Science is subject where the highest shortage is estimated to be found. But as supply will not be, made available in accordance with the need due to limited areas and resources ,the shortage of manpower in this sector is expected to be huge, The demand and supply position of Agricultural manpower is presented in Table No.15. In Forest manpower, while a big shortage was expected in high and basic level but with a huge surplus in the medium level by the end of the sixth plan, the actual revised estimate has been some few shortage in high and medium level but with some more surplus in the basic level because of large supply in that level than needed, by end of the fiscal year 1984/85. As a result there shall be no need of additional supply to be made in the basic level during the Seventh Plan period. While supply in the high level is expected to be the same as is demanded there will be surplus, in the medium level because of excess supply during the Seventh Plan. The demand and supply position of  manpower is presented in Table No. 16. In Scientist and Technical manpower, there will be total supply of 1,267 persons out of 1,645 persons demanded making a total deficit of 378 persons. The demand and supply position of Scientist and Technical manpower is presented in Table No. 17. Thus, the total demand and supply of all types of technical manpower mentioned for the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 20,858 persons and 13,472 persons respectively thereby making a total deficit of 7,386 persons. Among them, there will be shortage in all levels of all sectors except in the medium and the basic level of forest sector where there will be few surplus. In this connection, the high level experts required under foreign aided projects will be met by means of supply through the concerned government and International organizations. Besides, more efforts will be made in obtaining more scholarships in the effected areas and send people abroad to meet the deficit. Necessary arrangements, will also be made in making more efforts for the development, reforms facilities, appointment systems etc. for technical personnels engaged in technical profession in different Institutes of Tribhuvan University. In spite of these best efforts it is expected to take more than four years to produce high level technicians like engineers and health specialists, and three to four years to produce like agricultural specialists. Hence arrangements in hiring foreign technical experts will be made available to meet the immediate requirements. Among the basic level manpower during the Seventh Plan period there will be huge deficit in Engineering and Agricultural sector and arrangement in meeting the deficit will be made by implementing various programmes like medium level as stated above. While arrangements will be made in providing better trainings to the local skills available in the villages and thereby mobilizing them; arrangements will also be made to provide useful short-term trainings to local people and ex-military man as and when necessary through Government project related office for the additional supply of manpower in the basic level. These arrangements will make a great contrib ution in meeting the deficit of basic level manpower and hence to developmental works. It is clearly understandable that the exercise regarding manpower planning should be made in a managed and scientific way so as to delete the imbalances and problems that occurred between demand and supply. Similarly at present, exercises are being done only for the manpower that are needed for the development projects to be operated by the government and no exercises are being done in the private sector. Since private sector also plays a vital role in the economic development of the country the manpower exercise in that sector also is quite necessary. During the Seventh Plan period, more efforts will be made in making managed & scientific performance in collecting data and information and analytical works regarding formulation of manpower development planning in the government as well as private sector and attention will also be given to make manpower planning more reliable and practicable. NATIONAL LEVEL POLICIES FOR THE SEVENTH PLAN CHAPTER 7 POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT POLICY 1. Population Position a) Population Growth: Though population census were undertaken every 10 years since 1911 a census based on international standards was completed only in 1952/55. In 1952/55 the population was only 8473,478 and it increased to 15,022,839 in 1981. Thus between 1952/55 and 1981, the national population increased by 6,649,361. The rate of population growth from 1952/55 to 1981 is shown in Table 7.01. The census of 1981 exhibits population growth in an indirect way. During this period population growth is 30 percent as compared to that of 1971 and the annual growth rate is 2.66 percent. It is assumed here that this growth rate will remain valid for the period 1981-84. At this growth rate the population of  will reach 30.00 million within the next 23 years. b) Number of Families: The population of 15,022,839, according the census of 1981 has been grouped into 2,585,154 families. Thus one family consists of 5.80 members in the average. Population distribution according to the development and geographical regions is given in Table 7.02 and Table 7.03 respectively. c) Birth and Fertility Rate: The main reason for the fast growth of population in the recent years is that the birth rate is still remaining high whereas the death rate has declined. Various studies have indicated that the crude (approximate) birth rate has remained at 41.57 per thousand. Likewise the fertility rate of woman according to census 1981 is 6.3. The fertility rate in the age bracket of 25-29 is high. That between 20-24 years is still higher. The fertility rate of the women in the rural areas is higher than that of the urban areas. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics the fertility rate at the end of the Sixth Plan is expected to be 6.1. d) Death Rate: Compared to various Asian countries the death rate in  is still high. Though during the last few years this rate has dropped remarkably. The fast growth of population has a direct bearing on the drop of death rate. In 1980 the crude (approximate) death rate was recorded at 19 per thousand. Now this rate is 16.57 per thousand. Similarly child mortality has come down to 115.2 per thousand from 150 per thousand in 1980. e) Age Composition: In the census 1981 population belonging to the age group 0-14 years was 41.40 percent, 15-59 years 52.90 percent and above 60 years 5.70 percent. On the one hand, the burden of bringing up of 41.40 percent of the population falls on the population in age group 15-59 years while on the other, because of the higher proportion of population in the age group 0-14 years high fertility population will increase in the future. Table 7.04 presents this picture clearly. f) \\tRegional Distribution of Population Between 1971 and 1981 there has been a change (in percent) in the distribution of population. The annual growth rate at 1.50 percent in the Himali Region and of 1.60 percent in the Hilly Region; and with 4.20 percent growth rate in the Terai Region population has grown excessively there. The population density of the country was 79 persons per sq. km in 1971 which increased to 102 persons per sq. km in 1981. In 1981 population density in Himali Region is 25. 10 persons per sq. km in Hilly Region 116. 80 persons per sq. km and 192 persons per sq. km. in the Terai Region. g) Rehabilitation: Distribution, composition and growth of population has a direct bearing on migration. If the process of migration from the Hilly Region to Terai Region and from rural area to urban areas has speeded up, bigger migration has been taking place. According to 1981 census, 929,585 persons migrated between 1971-1981 on the basis of geographical regions, Table 7.06 shows the migration taking from Himali Region and Hilly Region to Terai Region. On analyzing the statistics of migration based on census 1981, 14,784,246 persons, or 98 .41 per cent of the total population of 15,022,839, have been found to have been born in  while 234,039 persons, or 1. Since people are the resource for development and at the same time receiver of development fruits, projection of population is highly desirable to judge the impact of its growth in national development activities. In order to bring down the annual growth rate of population to 1.2 percent and the total fertility rate per female, to 2.5 in accordance with the long term population strategy, it has been necessary to bring down the growth rate of population to 1.99 and total fertility rate per female to 4 during the Seventh Plan. Keeping in view the experience gained in population control activities and the trends of population growth during the past few years and also in terms of the calculation of the total fertility and mortality rate the annual population growth rate is expected to reach 2.61 during the Seventh Plan. Whereas the first projection is based on the target of reducing the annual population growth rate to 1.99 and the total fertility rate to 4 percent, the second projection is based on the above tendency of the expected annual population growth rate of 2.61 and the total fertility rate of 5.8 during the plan period. The annual population estimate during the Seventh Plan period on the basis of the first and the second projection are presented in Table 7.07 (a) add 7.07(b). ♣ The economic and the physical targets of the Seventh Plan, has been made on the basis of 2.66 annual population growth rate. Age wise Classification of Projected Population. Effect of Population Growth on Various Sectors Increase in population tends to have adverse effect on various development sectors. Achievements in the field of economic development, on per capita basis appear to be extremely low. On the one hand, average agriculture production could not increase as expected in spite of the various measures for increasing per capita food grain production to meet the needs of the growing population, on the other hand extension of cultivable land is limited because of the mountainous native of the country. Adverse environmental situation has been created in the Hilly Region and Terai Region by extensive felling of trees for housing, extension of cultivable land and for other uses. The qualitative and quantitative development of education has been hampered because of the increasing number of students, caused mainly by the growth in population. In spite of various measures taken in the field of health services to upgrade the general health standard of the people, no significant improvement has been recorded in the health indicators namely the morbidity, mortality and the average expectancy of life. 3. Population Policy in the Seventh Plan It is universally known that the ever-increasing population pressure cannot be solved by short term and one-sided programmes. Therefore, long-term objective and multi-faceted national population policy was adopted in the mid-term of the Sixth Plan keeping in view the growing population. A fifteen-year population target covering a period between 1985-2000 was fixed according to which annual population growth rate is to be reduced to 1.20 percent and fertility rate per woman to 2.5. Assuming this target is fulfilled the projected population will reach 26.00 million in the year 2000. This national population policy when viewed against the background of technical difficulties and of public opinions towards population control, appears to be ambitious, however, it has become essential to increase the standard of living of the people by maintaining a balance between development and population growth. To fulfill the target fixed under this national policy, multi-faceted strategies covering family planning services to contain the population growth rate; integrated population programmes based on ecology, forest, agriculture and rural development activities; women development programmes, mobilization of indigenous resources including the involvement of non-government organizations and migration have been adopted. The objectives and policies related to population in the Seventh Plan based on the above strategies are presented in the following paragraphs. Objective To maintain a balance between population growth and economic development by minimizing the adverse effect of the pressure of the uncontrolled growth of population on its shape and distribution. Policies The following policies will be adopted in fulfilling the above objective: 1. by extending the family planning services the current unfulfilled demands will be fulfilled. 2. to unify all activities related to population in the development projects keeping in mind the inter-relation between economic development and population. 3. to give priority to all programmes related to women because the status of women in the society, female education and employment opportunity for women all affect favorably in controlling population growth. 4. to increase participation of panchayat, social organizations and non-government organizations in all programmes related to population. 5. to control the ever-increasing rehabilitation. In carrying out the above policies the following operating policies for different sectors will be adopted. 1. Family planning services will be unified with the health services, 3. To impart ways of propagating the knowledge on family planning and population education in the development projects. 4. The output of all the development projects should be computed on the basis of per capita. 5. To provide training programmes to the employees who are associated with the planning and execution of development projects for the execution of programmes meant for propagation of different aspect of population. c. \\tFemale Education and Employment 1. To increase the number of admissions of women in the formal and informal education and to organize motivating programmes through appropriate institutions. 2. To increase the number of admissions in skill development training courses and in trade schools. 3. To provide additional opportunities to the women for higher education. 4. Efforts will be made to increase the employment opportunities to women in the specified fields. d. \\tActivating Local Panchayats, Social Organizations and Non-government Organizations: 1. To make arrangements in availing the support of these organizations for promotion and publicity of the activities and problems related with population and the programmes related with family planning. 2. To promote and publicize vital registration system through these institutions and organizations. 3. To activate the central population assistance committee which has representations from the non- government organization as well. 4. The government institutions will associate non-government associations in training courses and seminars related with population. e. \\tControl of Rehabilitation 1. Persons crossing international boundary will be encouraged to register their personal information including citizenship at the entry points. 2. To make arrangements to make it obligatory to have work permits from the local panchayats (village or town) for taking up work. 3. Training will be organized widely within  for developing skills. Training programmes organized by the trade schools, ministries and departments of HMG will be increased and their implementation speeded up. 4. On-the-spot training programmes will be conducted in big projects. f. \\tExtension and Consolidation of Vital Registration System. 1. Registration of birth and death will be extended gradually in all the districts. 2. Arrangements will be made to utilize the collected statistics for analysis and project planning. 3. Registration of birth and death will be made more effective through Panchayats. g. Population Education and Training. 1. Courses on population will be included in the formal and informal education and also in higher education. 2. Courses on population education will be included in the higher level courses for training of teachers. 3. Short and medium term training courses will be organized for the employees associated with the population programmes and necessary institutional arrangements will thereby be made. 4. Employment Policy a. Employment Promotion: Manpower is one of the major resources of the country. Population of is increasing at the annual rate of 2.66 percent. It is natural that economically active population also grows along with the overall population growth. It is therefore essential to involve the increase of active population in the productive employment. Various measures were launched in increasing employment opportunities in the previous plans. If agricultural tools were made available so were the irrigation facilities extended in order to increase the employment opportunities for the small farmers. Employment opportunities were made available to the unemployed and semi-employed rural population by launching rehabilitation programmes. Creation of employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sectors such as industry, construction activities and services, were attempted in order to divert the additional burden on agriculture by the added labor force. In spite of all these efforts, the problem of unemployment and semi-employment has not been much affected. Between 1971 and 1981 economically active population has increased 2.00 million and at the rate of 200,000 per annum. Because employment opportunities did not increase adequately in the non-agriculture sectors, the increasing economically active population had to depend upon agriculture for employment. The problem of semi-employed is very critical and at the same time educated unemployed is also increasing. If the need is there for the utilization of unemployed and semi-unemployed labour force as a resource for development, so also is the need to create production employment opportunities in order to raise the standard of living of the people. Therefore, creation of production employment opportunities is one of the basic objectives of the Seventh Plan. b. Shape of Labour Force: Though the international convention is to take the population over 15 year as the labour force, in  a big segment of the population of age-group 10-14 years, is also included in the economically active labour. Table 7.09 presents the shape and participation rates on the basis of census of 1971 and 1981. The total population of  is estimated to be 16,625,439 in 1985 and 18,913,718 in 1990. During the Seventh Plan period the total population is expected to increase by 2.888 million. Accordingly, population of 10 years and above is expected to increase by 1.585 million. On the basis of the expected increase in the participation of the population age group of 10 years and above, the economically active population will be 7.814 million in 1990 the number of economically active population will increase by 1.041 million, and hence, it is necessary to create employment opportunities for this additional increment in the labour market. 91.30 percent of the economically active population according to 1981 census is engaged in agriculture. This demonstrate the fact that it has not been possible to shift the portion of population dependent on agriculture to non-agriculture sectors. Without changes in the vocational (professional) make-up of the labor force, people depend more on agriculture for employment. Only 3.30 percent of the economically active population is engaged on industry, and 3.80 percent on service industry. In the Sixth Plan, target for employment opportunities was set at creating 1,772,829 man years in government, panchayat and private sectors. Of this 1094,826 man years of employment were to be created in government sector, 414,062 man years in agriculture and forest sector, 60131 man years in industry and electricity, 372,130 man years in transport and communication and 248,503 man years in social services. It is not possible to assess in full to what extent the Sixth Plan target was fulfilled. Employment opportunities could be created because the government and private sectors investment lagged behind the planned targets. Lack of improvements in agriculture and industry did not bring about any change worth mentioning in the semi-employment opportunities for the maximum utilization of population remains a Herculean task. c. Population Related to Increasing Employment Opportunities 1. For increasing employment opportunities, productivity oriented programes in agriculture sector will be executed. Implementation of multi-crop system with irrigation facilities introduction of latest techniques for increasing agriculture production will be publicized and promoted. 2. Self-employment activities will be expanded for increasing the employment in the rural areas. Promotion and publicity of cottage and village scale industries and of production activities related to the traditional skills will be encouraged. 3. Labour oriented techniques will be encouraged for industrial production and construction of infrastructures. Creation of employment opportunities will be an important base for the establishment and expansion of industries. Nepalese labour will effectively avail the employment opportunities created by construction works. 4. Regional development policies will be directed to reduce number of unemployed and semi-employed labour after studying their regional characteristics. 5. Execution of regional programmes utilizing local materials and skills will be promoted for the creation of employment opportunities. 6. Priority will be given to associate educated unemployed in industry, trade and in social services. Various facilities will be given to the educated unemployed to enable them to play a meaningful productive role. 7. Priority will be given to encourage the participation of women by implementing programmes which will create new employment opportunities for the unemployed rural and urban women. 8. Training programmes in developing technical and vocational skills conducted by existing institutions to equip the manpower with different levels of technical skills will be expanded as employment opportunities created by development projects mostly demand technical and vocational skills. Short-term, on-the-spot training camps will be organized in project construction sites. Women also will be associated in the skill development training programmes. 1. Keeping in view the need for creating employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sector, agro-based small and medium scale industries will be established at the rehabilitated areas under rehabilitation programmes. 2. All industrial organizations will be required to run training programmes for developing skills of Nepalese labour Apprenticeship training will be developed as a medium of industrial training. 3. Institutional arrangements will be made to coordinate the activities of institutions which carry out vocation and skil1 development programmes. 4. Competent government agencies will be requited to carry out surveys on regular basis to monitor the situation of employment labour force. Periodic records of the works from foreign countries engaged in industries, construction works and other employment will be maintained. CHAPTER 8 WATER RESOURCE AND FUEL POLICY 1. Water Resource Development Water resource in  is an inexhaustible resource whose harnessing will strengthen the economy of the country. In fact, the prospects for a bright future of  largely depends upon the development of water resources. Harnessing this resource will support the all-round development efforts of the country as especially in the fields of electricity, general irrigation drinking water, fishery, tourism industry, transport based on electricity, export development capability, and so on. Greater efforts are still required for realising the multi-purpose uses and development of water resource for long term economic development. a. Electricity i) Generation of power: The achievement gained in the field of power development is very negligible. Various studies conducted so far reveal that generation of 25,000 Megawatt is economically and technically feasible even though the potential exploitable estimate is 83,000 Megawatt. As of the end of the Sixth Plan the total installed capacity of power generation in the country is only 129.60 Megawatt, which is 0.16 per cent of the total potential power and 0.52 per cent of the commercially exploitable power capacity. At the end of the Sixth Plan per capita power consumption in  is estimated to be 22 units whereas in the neighbouring least developing countries, it is significantly greater. Inadequate studies and shortage of financial, technical and managerial inputs have been responsible for this state of affairs so far. From table 8.01 it is also clear that expected success has not attained in the past. For the want of knowledge, lack of technology and dearth of technical skill progress attained in this sector in the six periodic plans is 4.85, 13.84, 33.27, 70.12, 31.80 and 60.50 per cent of the targets of those plans respectively. This certainly cannot be considered encouraging. 02 presents the installed capacity of power generation as of the beginning of the FY 1984/85. ii) \\tDistribution of Power: Installation of transmission lines was only 18. 10 percent of the Sixth Plan target. Distribution of power, already generated has not been possible to different parts of the country for want of consolidation and expansion of transmission lines, which is illustrated by the fact that only 51 per cent and 48 percent of the total annual production of Kulekhani power was consumed in 1982/83 and 1983/84 respectively at a time when economic development programmes like lift irrigation, small and large scale industries are facing serious problems for want of electricity in other parts of the country. This situation can be attributed to the imbalanced development of power generation transmission and distribution. Table 8.03 presents the picture of power generation, its import and export and consumption in  for the last few years. iii) Power leakage: Table 8.03 clearly presents the real situation of industrial and commercial consumption against domestic consumption and leakage of power in . Higher consumption of power has to be encouraged by fixing appropriate power charges for industrial and commercial users as well as for the domestic users. The situation of power leakage is also grave and is presented in the Table 8.05. Revenue from power is dwindling. Hence, necessary steps have to be taken in making all the measures, so far taken, effective in the control and elimination of power leakage. For the economic development in the remote hilly areas where it is difficult to install transmission lines, launching of micro hydro power projects is essential. While it is desirable to integrate irrigation and drinking water activities with the imp lementation of such micro hydro projects it is equally desirable to encourage the use of local labour, skills and resources in construction of the projects. Power generated from these projects can then be used for cottage industries, lift irrigation and other productive activities. 2. Irrigation and Meteorology a. \\tIrrigation greatly contributes to agriculture development. A total of 2.65 million hectares of land receive irrigation facilities 1.40 million hectares by big rivers, 70010 00 hectares by small rivers and underground \\'water in the terai region and 550,000 hectares in the hilly region. The achievements of the Sixth Plan are presented in Table 8.06. By the end of the Sixth Plan 338,672 hectares will receive irrigation \\'facilities through the government efforts. This is only 13.03 percent of the total irrigable land. This sort of low irrigation facilities after 6 periodic plans can not be considered encouraging. Moreover out of this total, only 42.00 per cent or 5.47 per cent of the total irrigable land will receive irrigation facility effectively. Greater efforts are, therefore, called for increasing the effectiveness of already created irrigation facilities in the irrigation sector the progress achieved vis -a-vis the specified target in the first to the sixth plan was only 15.40, 46.53, 5.45, 65.30 and 40.32 per cent respectively. In this situation, it is essential to have efficient and time-bound execution of irrigation projects, planning of projects to increase the integrated acreage, efficient operation of the completed projects and their maintenance including the regulation of related legal problems. b. \\tScarcity of foodgrains in the Hilly Region is a major problem for the country. This is the main cause for necessary rehabilitation of these areas. Feasible surface, lift and pond irrigation projects have to be implemented for making the hilly region self-reliant. c. \\tSurface and underground water development projects must be implemented on a priority basis to utilise the water resources of the country. But the progress so far has not been satisfactory. Sikta, Babai and Bagmati projects are the examples of slow implementation. The call of the day is to utilise the indigenous economic resources in harnessing the water resources by depending less on external resources. If benefits derived from irrigation projects ca be permanently maintained, their utility value will increase and thus, enhance the agricultural production of the country. Because of the different constraints, irrigation projects of the previous plans could not be properly maintained. Therefore, in the Seventh Plan, special attention will be given to supervision and maintenance of the completed irrigation projects in order to make available properly managed and reliable supply of irrigation water to the farmer without adversely affecting the agriculture programmes of the Seventh Plan. Necessary steps will also be taken to encourage participation of the farmers in such projects. d. \\tAs development of command areas was not up to the mark, the need now is to develop such projects which will have a definitive command area. Duplication will be comp letely avoided while designing and executing irrigation projects in the plan for providing irrigation facilities. e. \\tSince irrigation water, supplied to the farmers, will increase their agricultural production, proper maintenance of projects constructed at a big investment can possibly be carried out only if the farmer pays irrigation water tax. Such taxes will help service the foreign loans and, at the same time, any surplus can be invested in the new projects. f. \\tWeather forecas t can help the farmers to determine the time, place and type of crops for plantation in advance. Though some studies have been conducted on this field there has been no substantial progress. Meteorological data of  is available only for 25 years, for effective forecasting 100 years data are required and so attempts will be made to compute such data in the Seventh Plan. Also collection of data from the neighbouring countries has been initiated for supporting weather forecasting in . g. \\tLand erosion has posed itself as a national problem. Timely control of floods and prevention of erosions is extremely essential and these activities have to be carried within the limited economic and technical capability of the country and with the participation of the people. 3. Drinking Water a. Easy availability of pure drinking water is the basic necessity for the good health of the people. has, been designing and imple menting health programmes in line with the United Nations programme of providing good health to all the people of the world by 2000. b. Table 8.07 presents the situation of drinking water facilities on the basis of population at the end of the Sixth Plan. c. \\tEfforts are in full swing to supply drinking water through pipes. Still lack of studies, lack of commodities, transport problems, lack of technical manpower, inexperienced contractors, etc. are some of the major obstacle to successful implementation. Hence, it is necessary to consider supply of water by wells, stone taps, etc. with the participation of people as an additional alternative in addition to the supply of water through pipes. Drinking water projects have to be made more economical in order to supply drinking water to a larger segment of the population as it is a basic necessity. d. \\tDrinking water is not accessible to all the population in the urban areas. The purity of water supplied to these areas is also not property maintained. It is highly desirable that distribution system should be improved in order to supply pure drinking water and in plenty too. e. \\tSo far, attention has centered around supply of drinking water through pipe only while the purity aspects have not received due consideration. However, there are several indications to suggest that leakage of drinking water is a serious problem. So necessary studies have to be conducted to assess the quantity of this leakage and revise ways and means to stop it. g. \\tTo hand over the drinking water project to the local institutions such as Panchayat for the supply of water and maintain the water projects in proper order in the rural and urban area. If local Panchayats can be associated during the construction stages its effectiveness will also increase and this also needs serious consideration. 4. Alternate Fuel Development 94 percent, of which is met by traditional fuel and 6 percent by commercial fuel. Fuel supply is met mostly by timber, firewood and imported petroleum products. Unceasing deforestation and ever-increasing prices of commodities not only put a brake to the development works but also adversely affect the balance of payments. Fuel problem is magnifying itself and is having an adverse effect on the ecology itself. In the immediate future, programmes for the development of alternate sources of fuels, and for protection and preservation of forest have become a necessity. In the Sixth Plan, it was foreseen that research of alternate fuels and providing assistance and encouragement to the organisations which produce alternate fuels was a necessity but no programme worth mentioning has been launched. b. For the protection of the forest and the propagation of the community forests and related programmes, afforestation programmes were carried and improved Chulo (indigenous heater) were supplied widely. The contribution of RECAST in the development and distribution of improved Chulo is worth mentioning. Ltd. established water heaters and solar driers but increased initial cost and lack of publicity limited their use. Similarly surveys were conducted in Mustang, Manang, Lamjung and Syangja on air-power development but no implementation has taken place. If the government can assist the private sector organistions specifically involved in the research, development and uses of bio-gas plant, gober gas plant, improved chulo, improved water-mill, solar energy and air power economically and technically, use of those equipments and methods will increase with less pressures on the traditional source of fuel. Programmes launched by the private sector have not been very effective, but even then, these have their own importance. Special efforts are, therefore, required for development of alternate fuels in the Seventh Plan. Objectives For strengthening the national economy by harnessing the water resources effectively for basic- services such as, electricity, irrigation, drinking water, etc. and for development of alternate fuels, the following objectives are set: 1. The main objective will be to execute projects for multipurpose use of the inexhaustible water resources for activities like electricity, irrigation, drinking water, flood control, etc. 2. The secondary objective will be to replace the traditional consumption of fuels by making use of possible sources of alternate fuels. 15. Constant effort will be made to seek mutual assistance among the countries of the region for expediting the execution of relatively big multi-purpose projects like Karnali (Chisapani). Since a few decades there has been a big change in the ecology of the country. High population growth rate, dependence of over 90 % of population on agriculture, non-availability of other employment opportunities, and fast and unbalanced execution of development and construction activities are the main causes for this destructive change. In the absence of employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sectors and in view of the increasing demand for foodgrains for population likely to double within the next 26 years, extension of land for agricult ure cultivation is very likely to increase substantially without any attention to the productivity of land, cultivation of the marginal lands, excessive felling of trees, excessive use of forest products and over-grazing, there can be considered the agrarian characteristics of the country. Fertile soil is being washed out by small and big rivers. Production is dropping inspite of greater efforts of the farmers. It is estimated that every year a layer of 1.70 mm. of fertile soil is washed away. Denudation, floods and landslides have been on the increase since a few years and desertification process in the mountain area is gaining speed. Desertification of about 10,000 hectares in Dolpa and Mustang districts has started and is spreading in other areas as indicated by deteriorating of ecology. It has been estimated that 47 %of the denudation and landslide are of natural causes whereas the rest is man-made. People from the hills are migrating to terai because of denudation, floods, and landslides there and forest in the terai area has been depleted very fast since the last two decades. Out of the total land area of 147,181sq.kilometre of the country, 18% is agricultural land and only 37.60% in forest land. The pressure is clearly increasing on the forest because 81%of the fuel required by the people is met by the firewood. This will continue for sometime till altern2.te fuels are developed, the ecologists estimate that 43 %of the total land should always be covered by forest. 94% of the population still depends on agriculture. In meeting the daily necessities of man and animals 50.00 million tons of green grasses required. If the present rate of consumption of forest products and productivity is allowed to continue, forests in Terai and interior Terai will be exhausted in the next 20 years and in the hilly region in the next 10 years. protection and development has become a. big challenge. Irrigation facilities, electrification, roads construction and industrialisation are essential for economic and social development of the country but these activities are increasing the pressure, directly or indirectly, to the national resource base and air, water and sound pollution is continuously increasing. Though use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides for increasing foodgrain production is a must but their unscientific application not only adversely affects the agriculture productivity but also endangers the ecological balance. Old and condemned vehicles have increased air pollution in the urban areas. Strong indication are being visible now that the ecology of the  is greatly affected by industrialisation process. Physicians are of the opinion that use of firewood without improved chulo produce smoke which not only pollute air but also make women of the rural areas more vulnerable for attack by various diseases. Drinking water is being supplied to urban areas but people in the hilly region have to walk several miles for a pitcher of water because of depletion of forest there. Physicians opine that water pollution is the cause of about 50%of the prevalent diseases. has not experienced sound pollution as yet. Vehicles blowing horns unnecessarily and the evil practice of using pressure horns by buses and truck on top of natural horns is increasing. Without adequately providing drinking water, drainage and sewerage and electrical supply, uncontrolled and ill-managed urbanization has increased a lot of dirt which have polluted water, air and sound and so variety of diseases is increasing. Development projects carried out without proper studies have affected the ecology of the place adversely. Hilly roads and highways which \\'are constructed without proper studies are increasing the ecological problems. If there is a need of natural resources for the execution of various development projects for the economic and social well-being of the people, preservation of natural resources and ecology is equally essential to give them comforts of life, nutrient food, pure air and water. Scientific land users equally important because ecology and land ale well interdependent. Objective Once the ecology is badly effected it is extremely difficult to bring it back to its original state even if huge amounts are invested. Although this problem cannot be tackled in full, however, plans for curtailing it can be considered from an \\'early stage. The objective, therefore, is to maintain good health, security and well being of the people by protection, preservation, consolidation and total management of the ecology. Policy As a means to solve this problem necessary arrangements will be made to shift people engaged in agriculture to agro and forest based industries. Encouragement will be given to convert the marginal land to forest and grazing fields for the best use of the land. 4. To collect statistics, conduct studies and research related to ecology in fixing the national minimum level of pollution. 5. Courses on ecology will be included in the formal and informal courses and by giving due importance to ecology education through exhibitions and publicity and promotions. 6. Special attention will be given to encourage the non-government organisations to participate in the ecology oriented protection and propagation activities. Accordingly Panchayats, class organisations and social organisation will be encouraged to be more active. 7. Taming of rivers with the participation of the people to control and erosion and to encourage afforestation and forestry programs will be given special attention. In addition efforts will be made to consolidate the process of balancing weather and water resources by controlling the land erosion in the watershed area. 8. To develop tourism without any harm to the natural resources and the cultural heritage. 9. Rehabilitation, urbanisation and development programmes will be implemented by scientifically classifying the land composition and land use. 10. Activities related to ecology involve forest, agriculture, electricity, irrigation, industry, commerce, road construction, population and public health. Necessary steps will be taken to coordinate the activities of different organisations in order to make them effective, keeping in view the fact that solution of ecological problems demand multifaceted and multi-organisationapproaches.2. Land-use Various studies have produced important statistics about the land use. It has been possible to determine the statistics of the area of cultivable and of the country at random. Demarcation of plots in many districts have been completed. According to Land Resources Mapping Project (LR.M.P. )report, statistics of land in 59 districts is in the final form. The area of the cultivable land of the remaining 16 districts can be estimated from the statistics available so far though estimation of production on the basis of estimated cultivable land area is not really desirable. On this basis, the cultivable land area of the country is 2,653,300 hectares. According to the National Agriculture Census of 1981 (sample survey) the land used by farmers totals 2,463,700 hectares. Though these two figures differ the cultivable land area of 2,653,300 hectares is computed by identifying the summer crop area and winter crop area and hence this figure has been recognised as the valid one for the purpose203\\'of the Seventh Plan. This statistics differs from the one which was estimated for the Sixth Plan. As presented in the Sixth Plan, forest area was 4,823,000hectares in 1974 and it dropped to 4,100,000 hectares in 1979. Because of realignment of the international boundary the total area of the country has increased from 141,059 sq. kilometer to 147,181 sq. kilometer. M. P. statistics clearly indicate that the present area of forest can be taken as reliable. According to the preliminary estimate by that project, forest covers 5,533,488 hectares of the total area. Though this statistics is bigger than the statistics published in the past, the methodology applied by the project being more scientific and the estimate being the latest available, this figure has been accepted for the purpose of Seventh Plan. According to the estimate referred to above. Land composition of the total land area of the country on the basis of different types of land-use is shown in the Table 9.01. The objective and policy on ecology and land use policy are enumerated as follows Objective To use the land asset of the country more scientifically to maintain the natural beauty and ecological balance, Land-use policy 1. To stop the cultivation of non-productive and marginal land. 2. Suitable land for cultivation will be identified and afforestation in the marginal land will be implemented. 3. Policy will be adopted to develop suburban areas by providing necessary amenities in lands except productive lands which will be utilised for agriculture. 4. To execute programmes which will increase agricultural production from the cultivable land around the densely populated urban areas and firewood and grass production from the forest areas in order to meet the requirement of the population. 5. For increasing green vegetation in the naked hills, afforestation will be carried out or encourage commercial crops wh ich do not disturb the soil condition. 6. To adopt scientific techniques to protect soil for cultivation on the slopes with more than 30 percent gradient. 7. In steep slopy land, interior terai and base of the hills of the interiorterai, afforestation will be effected, which will preserve underground water. 8. Programmes related to taming of rivers will be launched with the participation of people for protecting the cultivable land and villages. CHAPTER 10 EXPORT POLICY 1. Introduction The population growth is increasing the demand for consumable goods and the in crease in capital investment for development is increasing the requirement of capital and construction goods. Unfavourable balance of payments have negative effects on the economy of the country and slower pace of industrialisation and weather-oriented agriculture production have caused dependence on imports. Limited quantity of exportable goods, uncertainty, low level quality, lack of know-how on international marketing, land-lockedness and non-competitive capability due to transport cost are the prominent factors affecting \\'s export. On top of these, inspite of the steps taken for developing the competitiveness of the exportable goods, there are grievances of the exporters\\' inability to receive the benefits in a simple and smooth manner due to complications in the administration of export encouragement schemes. The challenge now is to increase exports and earn and save foreign exchange by minimizing the negative balance of payment. It is essential to launch various programmes with pragmatic policies and sound procedures in order to stimulate economic development by giving export trade a high priority. 2. Assessment of Sixth Plan As the weather was bad in the final year of the Fifth Plan, exports increased in an extraordinary manner in 1980/81 followed by a sharp drop in the next 2 years. From 1983/84 even though there was no quantitative increase of exports, the income in monetary terms has increased. Exports did not increase quantitatively mainly due to the following reasons. failure of exports to increase in the same proportion as the national production. agricultural goods dominated export composition and production of agriculture depended on weather. no indication of improvement in the production of industrial goods, their costs and quality level. If exports are not increased during the Seventh Plan, the balance of payments will not only continue to be negative but will also bring grave consequences to the national economy. In the Seventh Plan the aim is to increase exports earnings by a minimum of 2.50% at constant prices. If this aim is fulfilled earning from exports will be Rs11.64 billion at constant price during the plan period. In the Sixth Plan there was a characteristic fluctuation of production and exports of exportable goods. According to Table 10.01 production of all goods except raw jute increased in FY 1984/85 as compared to that of 1980/81 but production of all goods in the first three years did not increase uniformly. Production of rice, maize and leather decreased in 1982/83 and increased from 1983/84. Production of raw jute decreased continuously in the past years and is estimated to have increased only in FY 1984/85. Production of carpet increased from 82,000 sq. meter to 3000,000 sq. meter (366%), ready-made garments from Rs 25.40 million to Rs 32.50 million (28.00%) wooden parquette from 219,449 sq. foot to 300,000 sq. foot (36.00%), jute goods from 15,905 metric ton to 20,000 metric ton (25.00%) and leather from 12.90 million sq. foot to 18.90 million sq. foot (47.00%). During the Sixth Plan period, total exports from 1980/81 to 1984/85 reached Rs 7.902 billion of which overseas exports amounted to Rs 2.751 billion. In the area of annual exports, exports to India is estimated to have increased from Rs 992.00 million in FY 1980/81 to Rs 1.128 billion in FY 1984/85. Exports to  has doubled in this period as compared to that at the end of the Fifth Plan. Overseas exports, instead of expected growth, dropped in the first four years but some increase in exports, in the fifth year is estimated. In the first year (1980/81) overseas export earnings recorded Rs 616.00 million, in the second year Rs 497.00 million, in the third year Rs 289.00 million, in the fourth year Rs 529.00 million; and in the fifth year the estimated export earnings will amount to Rs 820.00 million. The trend of export trade shows an increase in earnings of Indian Currency but not in the earnings of foreign exchange. A high power Exportable Goods Development and Export Promotion Council was established with the aim of launching a well-conceived programme for enhancing export trade in realization of the fact that the situation did not remain satisfactory upto the third year of the Sixth Plan. This Council has chalked out a well-conceived plan and has, in addition implemented a separate plan of action for FY 1983/84 and FY 1984/85. A 9-point programme was also launched under which cash subsidy was given for overseas exports. The results of 1983/84 and 1984/85 show that the new trade policy implemented during the mid-term of the Sixth Plan providing physical and other facilities boosted exports. In the meantime, fixing foreign exchange rates under a basket of currency system and the appreciation of US Dollar in the international market has encouraged the Nepali exporters. Net earnings from foreign trade cannot be considered to be increasing significantly because importing goods from overseas need adequate US Dollars savings, buying power of Nepalese Currency against US Dollars is decreasing and price of US Dollar against other currencies of the world is increasing. The important fact is that there should be a balance between foreign exchange requirement for import and export earnings, which in reality has not taken place. Increase of imports is directly related to the increase in development activities and so increasing development activities has to depend largely on imports at this stage. Against this background export trade is an important and strong medium for economic development. The following will be the objectives of export policy of the Seventh Plan: Objectives 1. To improve balance of payments by increasing exports, 2. To expand and diversify the export market by enhancing the competitiveness of the exportable goods with adoption of high technology and skill development. 3. To increase national production and employment opportunities by developing export trade. Working Policy 1. Unified commodity development programmes will be planned for increasing exportable goods from agriculture, forest, industry, mining and from other sectors. Production and quality development programme will be implemented for wool, raw jute, cardamon, rosin and turpentine, hand-made paper, cane and bamboo, parquette, woolen carpets, leather, stone, semi-precious stones, magnesite, lead, zinc, etc. from production stage to shipment stage. Appropriate measures for enhancing competitiveness, quality level and value added in commodity development will be adopted. 2. To coordinate the activities of different organisations engaged in export, promotion especially within a view to further identification and selection of exportable commodities, development of selected commodities, exploration of markets conducting studies and looking for large importing houses abroad. For t~is Export Promotion Council including its committees like commodity development committee and export trade management committee will be activated. Nepalese missions in foreign countries will be strengthened and activated in expanding export of Nepalese goods in external markets. Organised activities will be further consolidated and made more efficient for exchange of information, and related agencies and oranizations will be encouraged to participate in national and international fairs, exhibitions, seminars, etc. organised by government and non-government agencies. 3. Periodic improvements will be effected on existing Jaws, by-laws, foreign exchange rates and promotion policies on the basis of assessment of the trends of export trade. All procedures related to exports will be simplified, preparation of documents be systematised and the number of contact offices will be minimised. 4. Maximum utilization of facilities will be encouraged in reducing the transport cost of exportable goods. Additional attention to warehouse facilities at Tribhuvan International Airport, Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairawa and Nepalgunj and development of other physical facilities, efficient operation of clearing and forwarding activities, and improving the existing system of transport will be given. Model containers will be used in opening up different routes to simplify and to make effective use of the transport processes under bilateral transit agreements. Insurance system also will be simplified and made more effective. 5. Necessary steps will be taken to evaluate the comparative profit and loss position through both direct and indirect ways in rewarding and encouraging exporters. 6. Evaluate trends for smooth execution of export trade and consolidated existing institutional systems further to provide necessary information services to the exporters. 7. Expand production activities for the approved agricultural, industrial and mineral goods in order to make the balance of payments with neighbouring countries favourable to  and to avail of the facilities provided under bilateral agreements with these countries. 8. Special programmes will be launched for increasing production and export of light and high-value products on a priority basis by identifying such export-oriented products. Necessary arrangements will be made to establish export process zones after proper feasibility studies. CHAPTER 11 DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION POLICY 1. Introduction Since administration has an effective role to play in the all-round development of the country, development administration has to be effective efficient and austre. If administration can be made efficient to the required level for execution of the development activities, it will then be feasible to fulfil the set objectives. Coordination among consolidated, clean and honest administrative environment, development activities and development administration is desirable and essential. Therefore, administration must be made timely and effective, and be projected as the ma in axle of development. It is a well known fact that attention had been given to enhance the effectiveness of administration from the beginning of planning in . The policy of bringing timely improvement in administration has been recognised in every plan. But improvement in administration could not take at a desired level because of lack or pragmatic programmes, shortage of skilled manpower, lack of dedication in implementation, etc, Even though different measures for bringing improvements on an experimental basis were adopted by observing execution of different programmes according to the complexities associated with growing number of organisation and in different forms, it has been found, at the stage of implementation, to be non-effective and the desired objectives were not fulfilled. It is, therefore, necessary to create an atmosphere where skill and genius of\\' all can be exposed for development works by taking up improvement in administration as an integrated approach in a definite area of activities, against the background of existing style and procedural system, as a sample which will produce a clear and gainful results having a favourable impact on other fields. As compared to the Fifth Plan, although different government agencies have improved the respective capacity to utilize development funds in the Sixth Plan, there is still enough scope for improvement. In many development projects, timely decision making process is yet to be established inspite of the fact that measures for improvement were adopted for making administrative procedures development oriented and simplification was introduced in the decision making process, Though salary of the employees was increased during the plan period willingness and morale on the part of the employees have not gone tip as desired. If there is a need to increase salary in line with consumer price index, it is equally important to clearly define the authority and accountability of the civil servants, to evaluate their performance properly arid to have a system of reward and punishment. This will not only upgrade their morale but will definitely have a positive effect On the execution of development activities. Against the foregoing background the following policies are adopted on short-term and long-term basis in order to make the development administration more effective and execution- -oriented during the Seventh Plans. 2. Plan and Programmes The implementation aspect is very important for a successful plan but if the plans and programmes are faulty from the planning stage implementation becomes equally faulty resulting in the non-fulfillment of the objective. Similarly evaluation of the project under construction against the set objective, policy and target is an inseparable part of the processes. The policy will, therefore, be to carry out the following activities. a. An atmosphere of coordination among National Planning Commission Ministry of Finance and the concerned ministry for preparing plans and programmes will be established. Clear-cut working system will be prescribed in encouraging the concerned institutions to participate more actively while preparing the periodic and annual plans and programmes. This will help eliminate from the stage planning of plans and programmes. b. \\tProgramme oriented budget will be introduced while planning development programmes. This system will introduce the practice of showing the relation of budget with estimated expenditure of the programme while preparing tile budget and sanctioning it which will check the Practice of budget requests with and releases being made by the concerned authorities without adequate Justifications. With the aim of implementing programme oriented budgets, outlines of the feasibility studies investment estimates, benefit forecasts (benefit as a percentage of investment), implementation schedule, manpower requirement, commodity requirement, etc, will be carefully in preparing development projects. c. \\tStrong steps will be taken to make the proposed planning and evaluation units In the ministries which to deal on development programmes effective according, to the objectives of the Plan. Under this programme various activities such as organising task force, employing personnel (having required subject, skill and expertise) in the planning and evaluation units, discourage frequent transfers, assign jobs of the concerned units only, honour the decisions of the , ministries which have to handle development projects directly, etc. will be carried Out. Besides, professional know-how in the planning units in the ministry and department and in the National Planning Commission will lie developed. 3. Administration It is essential to bring about changes in the policy of personnel, administration in order to make development administration more development oriented. In line with the changing situation, necessary changes have to be made on recruitment, transfer, promotion and punishment rules for personnels involved in development administration. The following considerations will be given in the field of personnel administration. a. So far, educational qualification is the only basis in recruitment of personnels. This situation will be improved by according proper weight to those attributes of appropriate candidates which are consistent with the needs of the project concerned. b) \\tIn the field recruitment of technical personnel, the technical ministry will be given, the responsibility of hiring such personnel to minimise the time involved in procedural rnatters. c. \\tNormally, transfer of personnel from development projects will be discouraged if the concerned projects are likely to be adversely affected by such transfers. d. \\tPromotion, reward and punishment are important factors which influence the ingenuity and dedication of the personnel. The success of project implementation largely depends on the diligence and dedication of the personnels. The basis for promotion, training,, reward and punishment should be based on the jobs executed by them and on the basis of work progress than on the basis oil their experience or their educational qualifications. c. \\tAs long as the minimum requirements of the persons in fixed income brackets are not fulfilled, capability and dedication will, in practice, remain utilized. Improvement in the salary and allowance structure of the employees on the basis of consumer price index will be effected at regular interval. 4. Decision Making Process Decentralisation and delegation of authority are important place in making development administration more effective especially in view of the existing geographical situation and of the transport and communication system developed s o far. Against this background the following policies will be adopted. a. To develop the mechanism of implementation and evaluation of development programmes by establishing regional offices of the ministries handling development projects in. all the five regions. Ministries associated with the development projects have to consolidate their respective regional offices. In the Seventh plan, the following policies will be adopted in the field of economic administration. a. The present system normally awards contract for construction works for development projects to the lowest bidder after proper invitation of tender application. Past experiences suggest that inexperienced contractors who have received the contract awards on the basis of lowest bid either do not execute the contract and even if they do case of execution they dropped away midway fearing loss, even execute the contracts, their work standard is generally of low quality. In this background, institutional development will be encouraged among the local or national contractors by scientific classification of the contractors and by the practice of informing them on the estimated amount of the work while inviting tenders. Economic rules and. procedures related to contract award and classification of contracts will be accordingly amended or improved. b. Projects executed by His Majesty\\'s Government fall into two categories. There are projects executed under departmental supervision and project-, run by development committee, corporation, centre, company, etc. Ministry of Finance all such requests of ministries, departments and other offices. However, this has led to this process sanctioning of the regular budget being simplified whereas budgetary release process of development budget has not changed much as a large share of the development budget comes from the foreign aids and loans and releases on which sanctioned only after the aid portion is deposited at the centre. Hence only projects having definite financial commitments will be included in the annual programme by introducing effective improvement in the tradition of providing resources from the planning stage of such projects. This will help simplify the process of budgetary releases. Management oriented accounting system will be introduced which will produce data for the purpose of plan formulation, execution and evaluation. A task force will be formed to recommend on necessary improvements on budget sanctioning process and accounting system and steps will be undertaken to implement these recommendation 6. Foreign Aided Projects The following points will be considered as the guiding factors for projects to be implemented with external assistance. a. While preparing the projects or programmes for external assistance. Priority should be given to the policy and objectives set by the National Planning Commission. b. Projects under foreign aid will be included in the annual programmes only after the project agreements are signed. c. \\tSteps to identify and solve problems related with coordination and with projects execution will be undertaken to enhance the capability to utilize the available resources in full. 7. Revenue Administration Revenue administration is very important in mobilization of internal resources for the implementation of development programmes. Therefore, different steps related to organisation, training, improvement, study and administration will be undertaken to make the tax system scientific, simple and effective. 8. Special Effort for on--the-spot Support to l1evelopment Projects If projects are not formulated with proper consideration to technical aspects, chances are that the essential services will not reach the project site and chances are that such projects will not be successfully implemented. It is therefore necessary to collect information on the list of personnel supply of manpower, receipt of budget amount, supply of development commodities and distribution, authority for expenditure and sanctioning, etc. at the project site in time for execution of approved projects. Hence, it is desirable to have the plan of providing the administrative services for feeding the essential logistics to the project sites ready along with tile approval or tile pi objects. A system of joint approval of projects will be introduced after proper consultation among Ministry of Finance, looking into the financial resources and their source, National Planning Commission, looking into the various aspect of development projects, and Ministry of General Administration, looking into the aspects of manpower, which preparing for the budget discussions or drafting of project agreements. Supply of manpower will be made by introducing the pool system. Delegation of authority to the Secretary and other Chief Officers is given by administrative and financial rules to a certain extent. Unnecessary delays have been observed not only due to non -uniform delegation of authorities but also from inadequate delegation. Jobs, duties and authorities will be clearly defined by regulations from the secretary down to projects chiefs. Supply of construction materials throughout the country because of landlockedness and geopolitical factors, is taking the form of a big challenge. Most of the projects are not completed in time mainly because construction materials are not available at time due to several bottlenecks. Therefore, for tile supply of essential goods to the projects, time -bound improvement will be introduced. It has become necessary to follow the scientific methodology in new constructions such as airport, roads, buildings, channels, canals, dams, etc. Regulations have to be framed for awarding contract, fixing conditions, defining, limitation, etc. Attempts will be ma0c to introduce construction codes which should accompany the designs showing all technical inputs. 9. Improvement According to the principles of decentralisation, plan formulation, execution and evaluation will be carried out by town, village and district panchayats. It is essential to encourage the staff of those institutions in upgrading their administrative capability by teaching the methods of formulation, execution and evaluation of the plans. Hence, these staffs will be trained. The centre will also be required to delegate more authorities to the district level offices according to the necessities. The concerned offices will be made more efficient during the plan period. 10. Miscellaneous a. \\tLabour and Local Skill Mobilisation of Nepalese labour will be given top priority and maximum utilisation of skill, technology and the capacity at the local and national level will be taken as guiding factors for adopting this policy. b. Upgrading the Capacity at Non-government Level Non-government organisations have equally important roles to play as the government organisations in strengthening development administration. Well managed organisations in the non-government sector can contribute a lot in carrying out non-government sector can contribute a lot in carrying out feasibility studies, surveys, designs, estimates and socio-economic surveys. Necessary support to these organisations for their development, promotion and expansion will be provided during the plan period. This will not only stop the outflow of capital but help to develop the capacity within the country c. \\tCoordination and Support Lack of coordination or assistance within the same organisation or between ministries has taken the form of a major problem in making development administration effective. Attention will be given to develop a practice of understanding or collecting opinions at different stages by a process maintaining coordination, consultation, and comments on plans, programmes or projects. CHAPTER 12 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY 1. Introduction Use of science and technology is essential for rapid economic development of the country. If use of science and technology can increase production and productivity of agriculture on the one hand, it can also increase employment by utilising the local resources on the other hand. The need of the hour to-day is to recognise on science and technology as an important resource of the country which is to be used in full in a planned manner as an inseparable part of the development process. Various scientific instruments have to be used in the course of national economic development. Technologies which are not available in the country have to be imported from the international market. Imported technologies may directly be used in the workfloor without any adjustment and technologies related to industrialisation and water resource development can be utilised as they are imported. Articles such as hand made paper, radhi, suspension bridges, construction of irrigation canals, curios, Karua, Khukuri, utensils of copper and clay, cane and bamboo basket (Doka), bags, etc. have been using indigenous techniques. These traditional skills must be developed and changes, if necessary, be introduced in these techniques according to the need of time. Imported technologies should be studied and evaluated on the basis of their adoptability to ascertain whether changes are called for in local adaptation. Search for necessary techniques and their development largely depends on the capability of science and technology of the country. It is, therefore, obvious that developing the capability of science and technology of the country has to be given priority and definite programmes have to be worked out accordingly. While search is going on for the new international economic order for bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries, economic aid alone is not the solution. Country like  should expand the know-how, skill and resource in the field of science and technology, should lay more emphasis on the search of international technical aid lather than economic aid for developing the capability for self-reliance. Publicity and promotion in making the people conscious and Interested on the use of science and technology for economic development of the country is most essential, It is necessary to upgrade the capacity of science and technology, to arouse people\\'s interest on it and to associate it in the overall development of the country during the Seventh Plan Period. The policy of science and technology was clearly spelt-out in the Sixth Plan. Attempts were made in all the previous plans to develop science and technology but it was only in the Sixth Plan that the basic prerequisites were developed. of Science and Technology was established in an effort to solve some of the problems related to the development of science and technology in the Sixth Plan. There has been a quantitative growth in the number of professional organisations involved in the development of science and technology. of Science and Technology has contributed significantly in exchange of research information among scientists and technologists by organising national science and technology fairs, and by other such activities. At the same time, these efforts have helped scientists and technologists to identify areas for research and innovations. A number of books were also published highlighting the -rate of science and technology. Several studies and research works were carried out on subjects related to development in His Majesty\\'s Government research laboratories in areas like agriculture, drugs, mineral, food and pharmaceutical. In addition, research works in the field of science, agriculture, forest, engineering, medical science, etc. were also undertaken in different campuses of . The Applied Science and Technology Research Centre of Tribhuvan University introduced an information services on development and expansion of appropriate technology. During this plan period, high level manpower in the field of engineering, medical science, agriculture and forest has been produced conforming to the aim of self-sufficiency in technical manpower. High level research activities have also been conducted in the campu ses of  on basic sciences. Efforts are underway to consolidate middle level science education. The progress, though satisfactory, is far from being adequate. The situation calls for the need to bring awareness in the people and arousing interest in them on the utility and use of science and technology and for a continuous search for appropriate technology from foreign countries by bringing coordination between His Majesty\\'s Government, Tribhuvan University and other organizations in developing indigenous technology. The crux of the problem is that an appropriate environment is yet to be created for the development of science and technology in the country. Lack, of mobilization of scientific and technical manpower, low national investment on science and technology, low level of standard of educational activities, lack of respect for scientists and technologists, lack of reliable statistics for drawing up plans and the lack of physical facilities for conducting research works are the major impediments in creating such an environment. The objective of science and technology policy in the Seventh Plan- will be to develop programmes for solving these problems gradually. Objective 1. To fulfil the national objective of the Seventh Plan by developing science and technology in the same pace as that of economic and social development of the country. 2. To upgrade the capability of science and technology of the country by developing scientific and technical manpower, execution of research and development activities, transfer of know-how on science and technology and by proper organizational development and management. 3. To expand the use of science and technology by bringing awareness to the people on its utility and value. Policy equipment etc. which are required for execution of research and development works related to science and technology in meeting the short-term and long-term national requirements. In following the above policies the programme of science and technology will be directed in the following manner: a. Determining Priority in the Field of Science and Technology Priority in the field of science and technology for its utilisation in fulfilling the needs of the country will be determined on the basis of short -term and long-term considerations. Emphasis will be laid on the effective development of science and technology by establishing a system of plan formulation, monitoring and evaluation. b. Research and Development in Science and Technology Research and development in various fields will be initiated for meeting the immediate requirement of science for developing technology. Necessary amendments or changes will be introduced into the imported techniques to suit the local conditions. Likewise, science and technology information services for dissemination of development technologies and scientific results will be strengthened. Efforts will also be made to coordinate the research and development activities carried out by different institutions in the country. c. \\tDevelopment of Science and Technology Manpower Training Educational institutions will be provided with modern facilities for upgrading the standard of training in the field of science and technology and for its uses in the development works, and arrangements will be made to teach new subjects which are important for the country by bringing in necessary changes in the syllabus. To produce standard science manpower, additional laboratories, workshop, etc. and educational materials will be supplied and training will be given for development of skill. Institutions related to science and technology will expand the know-how on inter-related subjects by providing science education on technical know-how and development of skill and technology education for strengthening the base of science for promotion of both the fields. To further strengthen the educational activities, researchers will be encouraged to use their experience in education. Opportunities for career development will be given to increase productivity of the available scientists and technologists. Modern education materials and laboratories will be established in the schools in order to improve the standard of science education from the lower level. d. \\tDevelopment of Different Aspects in the use of Appropriate Science and Technology Inter-sectoral technologies will be developed for adoption of different aspects of science and technology in connection with the development of the country. Indigenously developed technologies will be further tested for promotion. Use of tested technologies will be widened. Economic, technical and other forms of assistance will be extended to institutions engaged in the development and expansion of such technologies. 5. Publicity and Promotion People will be informed about the concepts, utility and importance of science and technology to the day to day life. Promotion and publicity will be carried out through different media (such as exhibitions, publications, talks, radio, essay competition, etc.). Professional organizations engaged in such activities will be made more active by providing more facilities. Seminar, workshop, etc. will be organized among the science and technology groups for the exchange of results of research and development and research achievement from different institutions. Publication of scientific and technological magazines will be encouraged and for making such publications regular and of standard quality necessary assistance will be provided. URBANISATION AND HABITATION POLICY Urbanisation in  as compared to that in developed countries, though negligible, has been increasing continuously from the day the concept of planning for economic development was adopted. The concentration of population in the urban areas testifies to the rapid process of urbanisation. The urban population and its annual growth rate has been increasing since the last few decades. In the census 1952-55 urban population was 237,000 i.e., 2.80 percent of the total population. In the census of 1961 it increased to 336,000 which went upto 462,000 or 4.00 percent of the total population in 1971. The latest census (1981) shows that the population of the town panchayats has hit 957,000 which is 6.38 percent of the total population. By 1985/86, the population of 29 town panchayats is estimated to reach 1.360 million or 8.20 percent of the total population. If the habitation of 5,000 or more people residing at one place besides the town panchayats is to be included in urban population, this will mean that 20.00 percent of the total population live in the urban areas. The population of town panchayats in the past few years and the average annual rate of growth of urban population is shown in Table 13.01. The growth rate of town panchayats indicates that it has far exceeded the national average rate of growth. If the national population annual growth rate between 1971 and 1981 stopped at 2.66 percent the annual growth\\\\ rate of the urban population shot up by 7.00 percent. On analysis of t he urban habitation of the population it is found that thirteen out of twenty three town panchayats having 46.05 percent of the total population are in the Terai Region. If inner terai is to be included, the number of town panchayats increases to 16 and their population is 53.29 percent of the total population. Similarly the population of the three town panchayats of the  is 3.80 percent and the remaining town panchayats in the Hilly Region have 8.71 percent of the total population. The high growth rate of population in the urban areas is not only because of the natural growth of population but because of migration from villages and other areas to the town and also due to the increase in the number of town panchayats. The number of town panchayats which are the main base of urban areas has increased substantially in the last 3 decades. Before the initiation of the First Plan there were only 7 town panchayats (Biratnagar, Janakpure, , Lalitpure, Bhaktapure, Birgunj, and Nepalgunj) in 1951 - 55. In the population census of 1961 the number of town panchatyats reached 11. Thus Dharan, Rajbiraj, Pokhara and Tansen were added to the first seven. Similarly in the population census of 1971 the number of town panchayats reached 16. Ham, Bhadrapure, Hetauda, Butwal and Siddharthanagar (Bhairawa) were added. The latest population census in 1981 increased the number of town panchayats to 23 by addition of seven town panchayats namely, Dhankuta, Lahan, Bharatpure, Tribhuvannagar, Birendranagar, Dhangadhi and Mahendranagar. At present there are 29 town panchayats in the country and is presented in the Table 13.04. Keeping in view the urbanisation of the last decade, population growth did not take place only in the declared town panchayats but the process of urbanisation started by habitation along highways, inner terai and hilly headquarters also. All these trends show that the pace of growth of urban population and population density will be still faster. With this trend, increase in the labour force also increase the pressure on the urban facilities. According to the Family Budget Survey 1973 - 75, it has been found that most of the families in big towns like , Biratanagar, Lalitpure, Siddharthnagar have found it difficult to avail the minimum residence facilities. Organised sewage system is available only in . Special attention has to be given towards maintenance of roads in the big towns where the vehicle density is increasing rapidly. Attempts have to be made in expansion of telephone services and while doing so, improvement of operation, qualitatively, has also to be considered. While observing the population situation of the last decade, economic condition and current activities of the hilly region, situation of employment, characteristics of migration, Increasing population pressure in the urban area and its growth rate, rehabilitation problems, etc.,- it is clear that review of the major policies of the Sixth Plan is very essential. Urbanisation and habitation policy has to be adopted on a national scale by looking into the characteristics and process of temporary or permanent migration from the hilly and rural areas to urban areas for employment, spatial problems in course of development, and extension of general services in the urban area according to urbanisation plans and their coordination, increasing habitational problems, etc. against the background of all-round national development. This sort of national policy for urbanisation will contribute substantially to national development and help derive maximum benefit by proper utilisation of the investment of limited resources. Objective On the basis of analysis of the current situation of the urban areas, there is a need for a national policy for its development. For a well-conceived process of urbanisation, the following objectives have been set based on a multi-sectoral approach:- 1. \\tto develop a well-conceived and properly managed urbanisation plan of the country. 2. \\tto create opportunity for productive employment and increased income with increased level of urbanisation. The following working policy will be adopted to make the objectives and policy effective: 1. Classification of Urban Area Existing urban centres will be classified into different categories for the formulation and execution of economic programmes according geographical situation and shape of the urban areas, population and their functional characteristics and economic resources and development potentials. 2. Role of Local Panchyats a. According to the Decentralisation Act, local panchayats will play an important role in urban development. Internal resources will be utilised to the maximum extent in the formulation and execution of urban development programmes. b. Arrangements will be made to provide central level technical support and related training facilities, etc. to the local panchayats for different aspects of formulation and execution of urban development. 3. Institutional Arrangement a. \\tOrganisational improvements will be brought about on the basis of studies of central institutiol1s like Town Planning Central Committee, Housing and Physical Planning Depaitmel1t, Town Development Committee, and local level institutions for making them effective for development of different urban areas . In the country. b. Necessary organisational improvement will be effected with an aim to develop , which is taking the shape of a metropolitan city of the country, in a planned manner. c. \\tRenovate the central parts of the urban area like old , Bhaktapure and Lalitpure, prepare master plan for roads, drainage, drinking water, general services for big towns of the country. with commercial and industrial importance and to execute in accordance with the master plan by coordinating the activities of the government and non-government institutions. 4. Investment Programme a. Investment patterns will be determined by formulating long-term and short -term development programmes for different urban centres. Necessary steps will be taken. to encourage participation of the private sector for execution of these programtl1mcs. b. To maintain the standard of different types of general services and facilities available according to the economic status of the urban area against the available limited resources. 5. Employment and Skill Development a. Necessary steps will be taken to activate government and non-government institutions which will support the creation of productive employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sector in the urban areas. b. Necessary arrangements will be made in conducting skill oriented training programmes by formulating investment programmes for ,creating employment opportunities in the urban centres. 6. Development Centre Consideration will be given to gradually develop the towns which are functioning as a development centre of the Development Regions in an orga nised manner. Special attention will be given to create an atmosphere whereby the private sector is encouraged in expanding necessary physical prerequisites and other general services for the creation of productive employment opportunities. 7. Development of Towns and Sub-tow ns a. Necessary steps will be taken on the basis of studies to be carried out with the aim of developing sub-towns or towns at crossings of  - under construction for connecting different development regions and hilly sections- and north-south link roads in order to rehabilitate the migrated population from the hills to the terai in a well managed manner. b. \\tCons ideration will also be given to provide minimum facilities required for towns in order to develop existing urban areas or important habitation for rural development as well. Through the process of urbanisation, financial sources and different services for development will be distributed to the whole of the country. 8. Development of Housing Area a. With the aim of solving the housing problem specifically for low and medium income group, steps will be taken for housing development. b. Active participation by the private sector will be encouraged for formulation and execution of investment programmes in solving housing problems. c. \\tSpecial arrangements will be made to extend loans to the private sector for constructing of houses under housing programmes in the urban areas. Construction companies or financial organisations in the private sector will also be made active for such programmes. CHAPTER 14 DECENTRALISATION POLICY 1. Introduction After the introduction of the Panchayat System, village, town and district panchayats have been established and thus the whole of the population has become a part of the Panchayat institution. With the belief that this institution, with its capacity to mobilise the local resources, can substantially contribute to the development of the country, a third sector called \"Panchayat Sector\" was added from the Third Plan to the two sectors, namely, Public and Private Sectors of the previous periodic plans. In the Sixth Plan, collection of plans of village, town and district panchayats was compiled as a separate volume titled as Part II of the national plan document to reflect the aspirations of the local people by giving Panchayat Sector broader importance. Similarly, with the aim of meeting the local needs as quickly as possible development subsidy was increased to Rs 56.00 million for investment in Panchayat Sector. Integrated village development projects have been an important programme of Panchayat Sector. Elaborate arrangements were made while formulating the Sixth Plan on the objective, policy and priority of integrated village development activities in . Various steps were described in the Sixth Plan to bring about improvements in the condition of majority of farmers by bringing changes in the rural economic and social pattern\\', create self- sustaining development process for the rural areas, develop leadership quality by encouraging majority of the farmers to participate in the decision making process, increase the productivity by giving employment to the large unutilised rural labour force, unify and coordinate all the activities related to village development which are interdependent and complimentary to each other, and wipe out existing poverty in rural areas through the medium, of complete programming. In order to fulfil these objectives, various policies were defined and the need for giving priority to fulfil the minimum amenities like education, health, drinking water along with the efforts of rural development to increase production and employment was described. Though integrated rural development projects were started in the past elaborate efforts were made for the integrated rural development during the Sixth Plan only. Eight such projects in 23 districts are under implementation through the joint efforts of His Majesty\\'s Government and different donor organisations. These projects helped in increasing production, rendering social services and in creating necessary infrastructure but failed to reflect the objective, policy and priorities of the Sixth Plan, especially when these projects were formulated. At the moment, there are wide gaps among these projects and these gaps are primarily visible in the areas and subjects covered by them, in priorities given in their organisational structure and in operational systems. In all these projects some common problems are prominently found. First, different activities covered by these projects have not resulted in operation of programmes in an integrated manner and as complementary to each other. Formulation of projects at the local level according to local needs, expectations and feasibilities have not actually translated into practice. Although the primary objective of rural development is to eliminate rural proverty\" investments in these projects do not seem to have made much progress in this direction. Clear-cut line of demarcation of responsibilities and coordinated relations, as expected, do not exist among differe nt levels of administration and between project management and central institutions, especially in tasks like project execution, follow-up and evaluation. Consequently, greater efforts have to be put by the project management in using the medium of personal relations to secure minimum of successes in the formulation and execution of programs every year, As can be expected in such a situation, physical achievements are much below the target. The policy of the Sixth Plan not being reflected in different rural development projects at the stage of their formulation is a major cause to the above situation. The other cause is that different conceptions on rural development among different donors, expressed and articulated at the time of project formulation, dominated the execution stage as well. Attempts were made earlier, and in the Sixth Plan to introduce the practice of formulation and execution of project in an integrated manner in different districts of  in addition to integrated rural development projects. In 1974, attempt was made to formulate integrated district development plan at the district level in conformity with the district administration plan. [n 1978, integrated rural development attempts were made in some districts through the medium of integrated panchayat development forms. The objective was to formulate on integrated plan at district level as an inseparable part of central level plan in the Panchayat Sector giving prominence to the coordinating function of the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development. Attempts have continued to encourage the formulation and execution of plans at the local level according to the wishes and ingenuity of the local populace for local development. New Background of Decentralisation The compelling need for adopting the decentralised system in planning and execution for social and economic development in line with the expectations and aspirations of the rural populace was learnt from the experiences gained in the field of rural development. As a result, the Decentralisation Act 1982 was promulgated for implementing the decentralised planning. Thereafter, in 1983, in course of formulating the basic principles of the Seventh Plan, the policy of formulating decentralised plan at the district level was fixed. This has heralded the system of formulating periodic or annual district level development projects at the district itself. With the implementation of the Decentralisation Regulations 1984 (from December 1984) a new background has been created for local development in the country. The attempt of Decentralisation has set up an elaborate modus operandi for local development. An organisation and institutional format was set-up for devising the process of formulation, execution and evaluation of plans based on the extensive participation of the populace for local development according to their wishes, ingenuity and feasibility. The objectives thus fixed will require that the local populace initiate and be self-reliant for the all- round development by maximum utlisation of local resource\\' according to the capacity of the local community for development of the district through the medium of local leadership and organisation. This will not only uplift the economic condition of the local communities rapidly but will also support the development of citizens capability of following democratic practices and carry out the responsibilities on their shoulders at the local level. Necessary organisational arrangements are made for formulation and execution of plans according to the above objectives. First, periodic or annual plans of village, town and district are formulated by Decentralisation of the. process of formulating plans for the maximisation of the local\\' resources by reflecting the wishes, and needs of the local people in the national plan; Emphasis is laid on institutional development by establishing local organisations which consists of panchayats and consumer committees in order to make the development projects long-lasting and meaningful ,by using ,the resource of the population and management capability~ Normally, nine service, centres will be established in a district in order to support the formulation; execution and evaluation of the plan in different areas at the village and town levels. Technicians from different disciplines will be employed in each centre. Similarly, at the district level institutions related to development will be converted to branches of district panchayat and will be assigned the job of formulation, execution and evaluation of unified plans. District panchayats and district assemblies will determine, the necessary policies and priorities for formulating the plans and approve them accordingly and review their achievements. Necessary central guidelines with regard to mobilisation of resources and their uses will be communicated in time to make feasible the formulation of plans based on local needs and ingenuity. Then periodic and annual plans will be prepared for district, town and village by including the resource from the local panchayats. Thus, the main base of development of district, town or village will be the formulation and execution of development plan at that level. In this effort His Majesty\\'s Government will function as an observer. His Majesty\\'s Government will assist in securing the resources from the central level and support from the national level plans. 3. Form of Rural Development Project and Policy This arrangement will create a basic ground work for the rural development in  and will help ease problems in this field. This decentralised system will enable every district of Nepal to formulate its own periodic or annual development plans. Various resource and programmes will be mobilised in an integrated manner under one institution and they will be complimenting each other. The policy in the Seventh Plan will be to make the process of development self-reliant by widening the base of local resource mobilisation with the use of increased resources, production and employment oriented programmes against the background of existing poverty and backwardness in the villages. The policy of securing aid from friendly countries and international agencies will also continue. Selection of locations for such investment will be guided by the principles of regional balance, feasibility of productive investment and a judicious distribution of resources. This sort of investment will lay the foundation works of the process of progressive development by eliminating the adverse situation in the economic, social and environmental areas in different parts of the country. The main objective of all these efforts of development in Nepal is to increase production, to increase employment opportunity, to upgrade the standard of social services and achievements and to promote favourable environment steps to institutionalise the formulation of decentralised and unified plans and to develop a process of execution and, follow-up to increase\\' the development efforts for maximum utilisation of local resource quantitatively, to widen the base of local resource for its development, to maximise the use of local technical capacity and to develop it and to develop complimentary relationship in the formulation of local and national level plans, will make the process of development at self-reliant. From the experience of small farmers development project and integrated banking programmes it has been observed that small farmers benefit more from development efforts through the programmes executed through them in small groups because small and poor farmers are in majority and hence this approach has to be given priority., This will enable the small farmers increase their production and productivity and will thereby influence the national productivity favourably. This will be a very important approach to economic development and to judicious distribution of fruits of development. 4. Some Important Conditions for the Process of Decentralised Development a. It is essential to fulfil some important conditions for the success of the efforts of local development on the basis of decentralisation. First, for the effective formulation and execution of the plan at the local level, the capacities of the local institutions have to be improved. Specifically, collection and analysis of local level basic information is essential to determine the target of the village, town and district and to develop the capacity for formulation, execution and regular evaluation of necessary programmes. National Planning Commission and its regional offices will play the necessary roles with the help of concerned institution. b. Though the authority and responsibility have been decentralised to the local panchayats on the basis of the Act and the Regulations, it has become necessary to delegate authority and responsibility within the government organisation to fulfil the intention of the new system after its introduction. This will enable the centre to pay greater attention to the national level policy and programmes without being entangled in local problems. 3. The centre will give institutional support with respect to economic, policy, technical and other necessary inputs for successful formulation and execution of plans by mobilising maximum resource in the local level. Regular follow-up of successes and failures cropping up at the local level will be necessary. In brief, formulation and execution of decentralisation is an important milestone for the rapid economic and social development of . For its success continued political commitment is necessary. It is also extremely essential that people\\'s representatives and workers and employees alike must have full confidence on its values and conceptions. PUBLIC ENTERPRISEPOLICY As long as the private sector investors do not take a leading role in the rapid development of the country as desired, the role of the government corporation becomes very important especially in term of developing the infrastructure, extending social services and increasing industrial production. Against the background of lack of investors, lack of entrepreneurs, lack of management skills and limited professional knowledge existing in the private sector, the government corporations contribute substantially in the economic development of the country. So long as the private sector does not come forward in meeting increasing demand for consumer goods for increasing population, in supply of development and construction materials, in developing minimum facilities to the people, government corporations have to undertake these activities. In fact, the establishment of corporations has been the primary base for development in . Corporations (59) established by the end of the Fifth Plan are adequate in quantitative and functional requirements. The conception of making the process of development effective, in the initial stage, through the medium of government corporations gradually changed and the policy has been adopted to improve the qualitative, skill and professional capacity of the corporations already established. Fifty three corporations which were in operation in the Sixth Plan fall under commercial, industrial, service- oriented and infrastructure-oriented categories. Among them, 43 corporation belong to first generation (100% equity participation by HMG),l joint ventures and the rest belong to the 2nd generation (equity partly by HMG and partly by other corporations). Bhrikuti Paper Industry, Lumbini Sugar Factory, Nepal Paper Industry, Butwal Textile Factory were the new corporations established in the Sixth Plan. Under the consolidation programme, corporations of similar 441 natures such as Nepal Electricity Corporation and Eastern Electricity Corporation, and Balaju Textile Factory and Disabled Welfare Centre have been amalgamated. Similarly, National Rice Mill was liquidated and Chandeswori Textile Factory and Nepal Churie Ghee Factory were sold to the private sector. Attempts are underway to make Nepal TeleCommunication Corporation, Nepal Electricity Corporation, Nepal Oil Corporation and Nepal Food Corporation commercially viable. Steps are being taken to amalgamate Timber Corporation of Nepal, Fuel Corporation and Forest Products Development Committee into one corporation and amalgamation of other similar corporations into one organisation is under serious consideration. With all these effeorts for increasing the commercial capacity of the corporations financial situation has not improved as expected, and the financial liability of HMG has been continuously increasing. During the Sixth Plan, the flow of funds from HMG to the corporations has been increasing regularly, (Table 15.01).In 1979/80, HMG sanctioned Rs 175.60 million only and in 1983/84 Rs 963.90 million. This represents an annual increase at the rate of 76%.As of 1983/84, equity investment by HMG in the corporations is estimated to reach Rs 2.20 billion. Besides, HMG has to provide in the annual budget every year more than Rs 1.00 billion as equity, loan and subsidy to the corporation~. By the end of 1983/84, additional liability has increased by Rs 700.00 million from loans to corporation against HMG guarantee. Funds paid by the corporations to HMG has increased only by 18%. In 1981/82 only, the flow of funds from corporations was in favour of HMG while the following years, it was unfavourable. This way, government corporations are becoming a big liability to the HMG. While analysing the activities of the government corporations it is found that their net investment has increased by 9.00%, (Table) 5.02) but returns to investment has dropped by 4.60% in 1982/83 as compared to that (3.00%) in 1979/80. In 1983/84 it increased by 1.00% thereby showing some improvements. Though the returns to investments in Commercial corporations have been negative, the returns from financial institutions have been positive. The contribution of the government corporations to the total national product in the first four years of the Sixth Plan has not increased. In 1979/80 it was 2.30% and it remained at the same level as well, thereby suggesting an estimated annual average growth rate to be 2.10 %. There has been no markedly visible increase in the sales of corporation products and so the net income has gone down. Collection of dividend during the Sixth Plan from the government corporations ws estimated at Rs 400.00 million but at the market price Rs 413.00 million has been collected by the end of 1984/85 and the trend suggest that about Rs 500.00 million will be collected. If the contribution of dividend from the Nepal Rastra Bank is not compiled on the basis of constant price it is not possible to raise even 25.00% of the declared dividends. The financial situation of the government corporations, as a matter of fact, is in a very poor shape. In addition, plenty of short-comings in management, commercial skill and in creation of scientific organisational structures exist in the government corporations. If the corporations were to control the creation of fixed assets in time and thus check the downward trend of the returns on investment, them the cumulative loss which reached Rs 850.00 million in 1981/82 and which is 40.00% of the total equity of the corporations could possibly have been avoided. This dismal picture can be attributed own functions on the one hand, and the negative effects of the practice of fixing price by government, on the other. In view of the rising production costs, it is likely that the situation will get worse if freedom price fixation is not allowed to these corporations. The following are the principal causes for the present state of affairs of the government corporations. 1. Lack of clear-cut and result-oriented objectives. 2. Inability to make the management fully res ponsible to fulfill predetermined objectives. 3. Inability to develop skilled management cadre. 4. Making the board of directors more active and responsible by checking undue interference from the government. 6. Inability to adopt planned measures to encourage the corporations to fulfill the objectives by regular follow- up with scientific evaluation system and to implement effectively the system of reward and punishment. 7. Inability to make the top management fully responsible and accountable. If the required improvements can be brought about in the present state of affairs, the corporations will still have an important place in a developing country like  for developing the country\\'s economy and in fulfillment of the needs of the people. His Majesty\\'s Government has been investing increasingly in these corporations with the view that they will prove to be meaningful and permanent medium in bringing about dynamism in the process of development and in the use of national savings for the welfare and rehabilitation of the people. If these corporations are left as they are, they will not be in a position to improve their commercial viability and will be a burden to the government. HMG has to bear the responsibility of providing minimum services, supply of consumer goods and creation of infrastructure and on top of it, has to provide financial assistance to the corporations already established. The present conditions of the corporations must be checked and efforts have to be made in the Seventh Plan to make the government corporations play a more effective role for national economic development. 1. So long s the private sector is not prepared to produce necessary import -substituting goods and undertake the expansion of infrastructures, government corporations will be developed as a major medium for producing such goods and services. 2. Since it is the responsibility of the HMG to supply the essential goods and basic services to the people, they will be done through the medium of government corporations in an organizes manner. 3. Encouragement will be given to private sector participation in the management and investment of Government Corporation and gradual transfer of ownership to them will be affected. 4. Steps to mobilize sources from the private sector will be intensified and the participation of the sector, through saving generated, will be encouraged in Government Corporation. The following policies related to public enterprises will be adopted to fulfill the above objectives: 1. Such corporations will be amalgamated more effectively. 2. A list of unnecessary of financially unviable corporations will be prepared and the process of amalgamating similar corporations, or liquidating them or transferring their ownership to the private sector will be affected. 3. Keeping in view of the general economic condition, level of remuneration and salary scale of similar systems, boards of directors of the government corporations, companies, bank and committees will be given full freedom to make decisions on their own on determination of salary, allowances and other facilities, appointment and promotion of employees, fixations of price of their products, capital investment, etc. based on their financial resources, economic conditions and annual profits. 5. With a view to safeguard the national and consumers\\' interest, policy will be formulated and steps initiated to control the quality of the products of corporation which have a monopoly right in productions. 7. Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Supplies will prepare a supply plain jointly and initiate steps to ensure supply of goods essential goods in an organised manner every years during the Seventh Plan period as the primary responsibility of the government corporations is to import and distribute in an oranised manner such essential goods for development and for the people . 8. Priority will be given to establish such enterprises in the industrial sector which will contribute to the goal of self - sufficiency. 9. Shares of government corporations will be floated widely for mobilising the savings of the people. 11. If some of the decisions taken by HMG in view of the overall national interest cause any loss to the concerned corporation, HMG will extend financial assistance to compensate the loss. 12. A separate unit will be established within the concerned ministry for necessary control, direction and for providing active support to the government corporations in addition to strengthening corporation coordination division of the Ministry of Finance. 13. Depending on the nature of the public enterprise, especially on the basis of whether it was established to earn profits, or to run at a break even point or to run purely on subsidy, a set of functional objectives will be developed and government enterprises will be classified accordingly. 15. Provisions will be made to award incentives to managements which maximise profits and minimize wastes against set targets. The board of directors will be made jointly responsible for its decisions with respect to the fulfillment of the annual objectives and monitoring of monthly progress reports. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY 1. Introduction The projects will be centred around the location where the means and resources are abundant if they are executed by giving priority to the conception of increasing national product only and there is a probability of having less attention to different means and resources in the geographical regions (Himali, Hilly and Terai) and the gap in the distribution of the fruits of development will widen which will create an imbalance and increase inequality in different regions. It is essential to have a regional conception in the national plan for utilising the resources of the regions and sub- regions in order to unify the national economy by spreading the wave of development to the towns, villages suburbs etc. adopting people oriented development process in order to reduce the gap and to make the people of remote regions participate in the development activities. With the aim of eliminating the regional imbalance His majesty divided the country into five development regions and accordingly development centres were established. The formulation of a regional policy has been necessary to unify the socio-economic development in the geographical region sub-region by considering the feasibility of development for the people of such places east-west and north south while allocation the development investments nd execution of projects. The need for long-term projects for eliminating the imbalance be tween regions in addition to the provision of assistance for national economic development has been recognised. Institutional development also is necessary for the execution of the policy matters while preparing the policies for regional development plans associating the locational aspects in the investment for topical programmes under the national topical plans. Since the decentralisation plan is to begin from the Seventh plan there is a necessity of proper understanding about this plan and regional development policy. Proper mobilisation of the existing means and resources has a big effect on the different regions for the national development. Since the shapes of regional development will indicate the direction of development of the country important policy aspect of the regional development will be to mobilise the means and resources on the basis of local capacity necessity feasibility and skill. The main objective of the regional development will be to mobilise the local means and resources for eliminating the regional imbalance. 2. Review of the Efforts of Regional Development. The stem of planned development was initiated with the aim of increasing production providing employment and raising the standard of living of the people. The Third plan gave prominence to regional aspect in the national development plan by dividing the country into watershed regions of Karnali Gandaki and Kosi with aim of balanced development by utlising the available resources of the country. More importance was attached to the regional plan in reducing this imbalance and the principle of development alignment was abopted by selecting alignment of proposed north south roads along the traditional trade-route of Karnali Gandaki Bagmati and Koshi regions in maintaining a cordial relationship between the hills and terai. This has given a definite direction to the Fourth plan. But the proposal related to regional development being presented as annex could not receive recognition as expected. As this proposal was based on the principles of development alignment it did not become easy for the national development to attain the set target. In 1972 after His Majesty\\'s announcement dividing the country into four development regions along with four development centres, that sort of unwanted and controversial situation was cleared a way. The division of these development regions became the basis for regional investment allocation and regionalisation of some topical programmes, but it did not help other as pects as expected. Accordingly the ojbective of the regional development policy is to increases national revenue by widening the foundation and boundary of development by utilising the resources in the particular region and community through the medium of appropriate methodology. Therefore in the Fifth plan the objective of the regional plan was to bring uniformity in the income by increasing the income of the majority of the population based on social justice in maintaining economic and social unification and by the mobilisation of local resources. The objective was fixed in the Fourth plan to execute small area integrated development programme by fixing the development alignment and giving priority to the backward areas different development programmes have to be executed by maintaining necessary coordination. The basic policies set in the Sixth plan are in line with the policies fixed in the fifth plan. But in this plan period also development regions were brought into the sense for investment allocation only. The previous far- western Development Region was further divided into two separate development regions. According to the conception of regional development integrated village development programme was also executed, Bu these programmes were formulated within the limited boundaries of some predetermined regions. It is possible to widen it throughout the country by gradually implementing in other regions. The need now is to formulate the guidelines of a definite regional plan and programme by synthesizing the policy conceptions and guidelines of the regional plans developed in the previous plans. Accordingly the policy and programmes of regional plan has been defined in the Seventh plan. Objective and policy The objective of the regional development will be to involve the resources And means available in different parts of the country for the national economic development to continue the efforts for balanced development by galvanising the national level periodic plan with the local aspects implement the plan effectively distribute the fruits of development equitably. To fulfill this objective the following policies will be adopted. 1. The utility and justification of the regional development is to develop the national and regional resources and means as infrastructures for regional development by reducing gradually the inter-regional socioeconomic imbalances. 2. To frame up the pattern of regional investment on the basis of development of resources and means available in different regions and sub region by mobilising them properly. 3. The basis of gradual reduction of the existing regional socio-economic imbalances for determinin g regional investment will be adopted. 4. Inter-regional socio-economic imbalances of the five development regions only will not be looked into as regional imbalances special priority will be given to the imbalances of the geographical regions Himali Hilly and Terai-also. 5. The development programs of the existing development regions will be executed as a basis for the feasible process of development and consolidation of north -south unification in the future. 6. The regional programmes have an important and long term role for this feasible process. The main objective of the regional programmes will be to use important plans and programmes from national point of view for the purpose of development concrete use of regional resources and means for the potential regional development initiation of the process of unification and its consolidation between inter-sub region socio -economic differences under the inter-geographical regions and development regions . 7. The long term utility of the regional plan will be to develop the system of planning including the national priority on the basis of regional plans in the national plan. 3. Situation of regional Imbalance From the analysis of the situation of the regions about population. agricultural wealth and development investment the situation of regional imbalance still exists. In fact because of the existing inequalities in population distribution agricultural wealth and development investment migration is taking place from the hills to the terai and effort s for increasing On the other hand problems like population increases, deforestation uncontrolled habitation in the Terai Region are taking a very ugly shape. On the one hand because of inequality in the distribution of population and agricultural wealth problems like migration land erosion deforestation and uncontrolled habitation are taking the shape of a national problem on the other because of the policy of centralization in the past few plans development investment was centered around a few places where there was adequate resources and means which resulted in one sided growth of a few places and the imbalance between such places and others widened ; and due to lack of complimentary production mutual exchange of goods could not take place the total economy has been terai oriented creation of problems strong and efficient system inter regional exchange of work procedure interdependence was felt and though there has been some solutions it still remains to be a problem. Of course due to efforts in some plans regional imbalances have been greatly reduced in social services like education health postal services drinking water etc . Development in health services is very encouraging. Also the gap in the geographical regions is almost very small in this field. Similar situations are appearing in other social services .But in other sectors the regional imbalance still clearly exists. Not only the mobilisation of resources and means but also the regional imbalances demonstrates the necessity and importance of regional development. 4. Spatial Outline of Regional Plans a. Basis of spatial outline: Determination of spatial outline of the regional plans as a supplementary to the sectoral development according to the main objective of the national plan is a must. Regional plan is an inseparable part of the national plan. Development programmes to be formulated for each region will be on the basis of national programmes. In order to make the proposed development programmes more pragmatic and effective it is essential to determine the level-wise regional development. Regional plan is a long term plan. Determination of level-wise spatial outline is essential for executing the long term programmes according to the objectives of the national plans formulated at different stages. b. Objective for the determination of level wise spatial outline: Determination of level wise spatial outline is more business-like when different regions are complimentary to each other and inter-action is more probable. For this consideration most probably it is desirable to have the upper level development regions cover the north south sections of the country. The degree of feasibleness of the inter action among Himali. Hilly and Terai as it exists is not found in east west direction of the same geographical region. Therefore, when different levels are determined it is desirable to have north south land masses for the regional work areas with different environment and means for the regional plans. Along with this it is necessary to define level wise spatial outlines with the regional imbalance of the east west in mind. Also keeping the existing imbalances in the geographical regions. Teral Hilly and Himali in mind spatial outlines will be determined. c. The existing five development regions have special characteristics of their own. Even thouth in these five development regions development alignments are fixed for east west division of the country the purpose is to bring regional unification by connecting the north south regions. Since sentimental attachment has been developed about the utility of these five development regions successful execution of the development programmes is possible. These development alignments of the five development regions follow the historical north south trade routes. Hence these alignments can be made more business like. It is necessary to create small businesslike sub regions covering north south geographical regions. In fact these sub regions will be the very workplace in the implementation of the plan. It will be more pragmatic for such sub region to cover Himali Hilly and terai . Formulation of the present district development plans in line with the decentralisation policy as a basic objective of the national development can be taken as the form of regional development plan. The sub regions will be determined by recognising the existing Zones. Since there are more than four districts in one Zone a district will be defined as a Third level Development Region, Physical development of towns will be done in a particular manner based on the priority required of increased urbanisation. This sort of development will be an inseparable part of the regional plan. a. Importance of development centres and service centres. These centres will play a very important role in the execution of development programmes in the Zones and districts as a sub region of different development regions. These centres not only provide the necessary facilities and infrastructures to the concerned regions but also are the centres for economic and social services . These centres will circulate blood in the life of the development regions sub regions and districts and development and inter action greatly depend on the role these centres will play. Without the development of these centres none of the regions will be business like. Hence the regional urbanisation of the country will be a supplement of the regional plan. b. Tier-wise development and service centres Establishment of development and service centres according to levels of regional development is desirable. If bigger centres are required for the development regions smaller centres will be adequate for the sub regions and districts . Developing three tier regional institutions for development and service centres of the three tier regional development plan are desirable. c. Role of development and service centres There are five development centres in five development regions. Necessary system and infrastructures will be developed for enabling the development centres to play their assigned roles in all the development regions. Minimum of one development centre will be established in the sub regions in each development region. For all practical purposes market centres or towns as covered by the development alignment will be developed as sub regional development centres. To bring rapid results in the concerned sub regions development oriented business will be concentrated in the development centres. Necessary arrangements will be made to have the regional development centres by road transport. Service centres will be developed in each district as a supplement to the spatial outline for the execution of development programmes in the districts according to the policy of decentralisation. These centres will be mostly service oriented. Such centres will provide the support to the development activities along with that of sub region or Zone development enters. The establishment of development and service centres will be determined on the basis of definite facts. The effectiveness of the roles of these centres will depend mostly on the nature of establishment. If these centres are not properly established they will neither develop themselves nor can support the development activities of the concerned regions. Various aspects have to be considered while such centres are determined. Because of the larger investments in regional development centers are determined. In majority of the places feasibility studies are to be conduced .Because of the larger investment in regional development centres though some centres are properly established it inessential to make them more active even if special programmes and additional facilities are to be given to them. The following factors are to be considered in the establishment of the development and service centres. a. central locality b. convenience in movement c. population of the catchment area physical area d. resources in the catchment area e. difference in market prices f. geographical situation e. Professional basis of the development and service centres : The professional basis of the three tier centres will differ substantially. professional and service oriented general and administrative institutions which will influence the regional level will be concentrated in the regional development centres. General and development oriented institutions and effective commercial and service oriented professions will be developed in the sub regional development centres. Normally service oriented activities like education health post office police station agricultural extension programmes cooperative market will be carried out in the service centres. Thus all the centres will be developed as a part of the total whole by developing different professions in the centres of different levels. All the service centres will come under the catchment area of the subregion development centres which will then be under the catchment area of the regional development centre. 6. Role of Regional Development Centres It is essential to analyse the regional means and resources and develop regional economics in a planned manner for the formulation and execution of the regional plans and programmes opne the on the spot outline of the regional development is formulated according to the above objectives and policies. Only in this way the objectives of the regional development on the whole will be fulfilled .Upgrading the capacity of the regional development offices in the development centres is more necessary. Development of manpower and expansion of other facilities in the regional development offices must be effected for coordinating the programmes and plans of all the regional level institutions established in the development centres. Therefore regionl planning offices will be gradually strengthened for effective formulation and progress review follow up and evaluation of the plan and their coordinating roles during the Seventh Plan. 7. Feasibility Study of the Regional Development Keeping in mind the fact that proper evaluation of the existing resources and means of the development regions have not been done so far it is essential to conduct elaborated surveys of agriculture forest land use livestock village industries and fuel in the initial stage of the Seventh plan in order to clearly identify the development potentials. This way by the end of the seventh plan long term plans will be ready whereby formulation and execution of the programmes can be effected. Regional investment will be made on the basis of the utility of development of the available means in different regions and sub-regions. In the field of social services even though the inter development regional imbalances are narrowing similar inter development regional and inter geographical regional imbalances still exist in the undeveloped development regions of Himali Hilly and Western Nepal and hence development programmes should be executed by giving to them with an aim to reduce the imbalances gradually. The objective of the development programmes of the sub region or Zone within the set limits of regional development programmes is to formulate and execute the integrated and unified development programmes and they will be formulated and executed in an integrated and unified manner on the basis of means resources and needs. One integrated and unified development programme will implemented in each development region in the Seventh Plan in addition to the existing integrated rural development programme. By the end of the Eight Plan such programmes will be implemented in all the sub regions and Zones. Within the authority delegated to the districts under the Decentralisation Act for formulation and execution of development programmes formulation and execution of the district development programmes will be carried out within the set development framework for the sub region. In the districts of the sub region or Zones where integrated and unified development programmes are not implemented, all the coordination of the development programmes will be carried out by the local development offices. COMPUTER POLICY 1. Introduction Computer technology was introduced to  in 1971. National Computer centre was established in 1974 to cater to the increasing demand of computer services. ICM 1410 with its limited capacity could not cope up with the increase in demand for computer services and hence, the Centre installed a more modern and larger fourth generation computer ICL 2950/10 in the first half of the sixth Plan. Because of increasing utility of the computer, use of computer technology in the private sector has been increasing in an encouraging manner. As a result, micro -computers are in extensive use in the country. Though the use of computers has increased remarkably within a limited time period, instances abound where a number of organizations have not taken full benefit from them. Mainly because of factors such as lack of skilled manpower, problem of repair and maintenance, inadequate knowledge of computer technology, shortage of appropriate software, this technology has not been used to the full extent. However, it is certain the use of computers will increase much more rapidly in the future. For tackling the existing problems associated with the use of computers, installed or to be installed, in the government, semi-government or private sector it is essential to adopt a policy for the development of computer technology in the country. 2. Review of the Progress of the Sixth Plan Through there was some progress in attaining some of the specific targets laid by the Sixth Plan, there is little room for satisfaction if the progress as a whole is considered. Various training programs have been conducted for developing manpower on different aspects of computer technology for the promotion of its use in the country. At the same time, workshop, seminar and exhibitions were organized in the last few years to make computer technology more adaptable. But even through the most modern fourth generation computer is installed in the  there is still a lot of scope for improvement in its functioning . In the Sixth Plan, private sector has also been active in the use and promotion of computer technology (mostly micro-computers). The private sector has been able to contribute to a certain extent in conducting training programmes for subjects related to micro -computers and to develop software package accordingly. 3. Objective of Development of Computer Technology The main objective of developing computer technology in  is to make available reliable statistics and information in a short time frame by the use of computers. Policy The following policies will be adapted to fulfull the objective set above: a. Effective use of computer facilities and capacities will be made by coordinating National Computer Centre and other organisations involved in computer technology. i. Proper studies will be carried out for adopting financial policies in encouraging production of computers with the country and for appropriate transfer and import of such technology. 4. Important Programmes Areas The following will be the prominent programme areas for the development of computer technology. a. Computer Training : A unit will be established for conducting training programmes on computer technology under the existing institutional arrangement with the aim of producing trained manpower for future development and expansion of computer technology in the country. b. Software development and research : Imported software are very costly and at the same time not appropriate in the socio-economic context of the country. Hence useful software will be developed within the country itself,. Also necessary arrangements will be made to export software if feasible for earning foreign exchange. c. Repair maintenance and improvement of computer: It is extremely necessary to repair maintain and improve the imported computers in time for their optional use. For this necessary physical means equipment and facilities will be provided for the repair and maintenance unit of the National Computer Centre. d. Formation of computer development committee. A high-level computer development committee will be established with the participation of private sector for recommending suitable measures by reviewing the existing policies and programmes as and when necessary in order to regularise the development of computer technology. National Computer Centre will act as the Secretariat of this committee. PRICE POLICY In the fourth year of the plan, 1983/84 because of the drop of prices of the food and beverages consumer price increased by 6.20% only. Thus the average price increase in the first four years of the plan is 11.00% per year. Both internal and external factors were responsible for the rapid increase in price during the plan period. Among the internal factors a sharp increase in money supply because of growing government deficit increase in prices of the goods and services provided by the government corporations increase in the rates of import duty sales tax and excise duty are the prominent ones. Among the external factors international currency situation and the fast price rise in the friendly country , which has a lion\\'s share ofthe foreign trade of  have adversely affected the price situation. 2. Price policy in the seventh plan Price policy plays an important role in supporting the policies and programmes of economic development as my be directed by a periodic plan. If the increase in price is too high not only the internal and external balance get disrupted but obstacles will be created in the economic development and social grievances will also be created. If unnecessary government interference takes place in the market price disturbance in the process of production and investment in the private sector will take place and the purpose of interference in the price instead of being fulfilled will be defeated and the situation will worsen. Since the economic activities of the producers investors and consumers are guided by the market prices it is necessary to determine what sort of price policy has to be adopted for rapid and balanced economic development. Keeping these in mind the following price policies will be adopted in the seventh plan : a. Monetary and fiscal policies will be devised and implemented.1 Accordingly the aim is set to limit the average annual money circulation at 13.00 % at the predetermined prices during the Seventh plan. To fulfil the aim efforts will be centred around the medium of revenue mobilisation for the increasing resources requirements of the government sector and dependence on deficit will be gradually reduced. b. Since production and investment activities of the farmers and entrepreneurs are affected by the general process of the market mechanism prices will have to be allowed to function as the correcting factor in case of economic imbalances and distortions. Government inferences will not be allowed in the market prices except in extraordinary circumstances. Even if the prices of certain goods increase due to unnatural shortages encouragement will be given to meet the supply by imports without resorting to price controls. CHAPTER 20 POLICY The following trends are distinctly visible in the financial situation of His Majesty\\'s Government ofNepal: 1. \\tincreasing dependence on external resources, 2. \\tincreasing deficit in the HMG budget because of inadequate mobilisation of internal financial resources, increasing dependence on the  eficits to finance the budgetary gap. It is clear that the existing tax policies need to be reviewed during the seventh plan period in order to tackle the above mentioned problems. In previous plans there was no indication on the framing of a tax policy. With this at the background tax policy will be fra med for the first time in the seventh plan, and accordingly necessary steps will be taken to guide the efforts of raising taxes for the mobilisation of internal resources. The main objectives of the proposed tax policy are as follows:- Because of these reasons there will be a strong pressure on the tax administration to mobilise additional resources during the seventh plan period. It will be necessary to generate maximum revenue savings for meeting the Development expenditure, for which a three pronged attempt have to be made as mentioned below: 1. To increase tax and non-tax revenue, 2. To control Regular Expenditure within the specified limit 3. To make the operations of the government and the government owned corporations more effective. The policy will be to maintain the annual growth rate of money supply at a maximum of 13.00% at the pre set price to keep the internal price and balance of payments of the country within a balanced limit. 7. Steps will be taken to execute the savings in the field of banking and to make their services more effectively. POLICY OF WOMEN\\'S PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT In the process of economic development women\\'s participation is important. It would not be out of place to accept the socio economic standard of women as an indicator of development of the country because women constitute half of the population of . According to the population census of 1981 out of the total population of 15,022,839 it is estimated that male population is 7,695,336 and women 7,327,503 It is evident that only an active involvement of the women a huge labour force consisting of 48.80% of the total population can accelerate the pace of development by ncreasing production. Necessary opportunity and appropriate environment must be created to make women participate on the same footing as men do in the process of development of the country. The women of  have not been able to fully take part in the development activities because of their uneducation ignorance and poverty. The superstitions prevalent in the society and negative thinking have been major obstacles in mobilising women to participate. National policy on women\\'s participation has been adopted from the sixth plan period to increase women\\'s participation by eliminating the obstacles apparent in the process of all round development of the Nepalese society including the women community. In connection with the celebration of 1975 as the Women\\'s Year throughout the world at the call of the United Nations the world women\\'s convention in the city of Mexico decided \"each nation has to carry out in the government or non government sector development activities in a planned manner by formulating a national work plan on the basis of the needs and demand of the country in order to execute the national work plan on development of women\" Accordingly National work plan for women\\'s Development was formulated under the convenorship of women\\'s services coordination committee by collecting suggestions through various channels about the feasible and practical programmes to be implemented through different HMG institutions and non government sectors for the women\\'s development in Nepal. With the aim of increasing women\\'s participation in every field in the socio economic development this National work plan has presented basic objectives problems and steps related to administrative and policy matters by allocating different fields such as education health employment agriculture cooperatives forest for women\\'s development . Though the programmes presented in the National work Plan have had concurrence in principle by the government and non government institutions for gradual implementation on the basis of practicability no substantial achievement has taken place so far in their implementation aspect. Nepalese women are employed in agriculture sector private industry cottage industries different HMG Institutions Corporation and non government organisations. Also the contribution of rural women in devoting their time and labour for agriculture and domestic work is equally important from economic and monetary consideration. But because of the present practice of evaluating only the economically active women statistics related to women\\'s participation in the total national product is very low. If it is extremely necessary to properly evaluate the active women labour force from economic consideration it is equally important to widen the limited opportunity for women\\'s participation in the process of different levels of decision making. The thinking is that in all the development projects which will be formulated and executed during the seventh plan the role of women will be increased and they will be encouraged to participate more in each social and economic field. The following objectives and policies will be adopted in increasing the women\\'s participation in development activities. Objectives 1. Proper opportunities will be provided for development of women a reservoir of huge labour force and make them efficient in their participation in each field of development in the country. 2. To upgrade the social and economic standard of women for their all-round development. 3. To make the women gradually self reliant and productive by utilising their skills and ingenuity. Policies 1. Women population must be educated and skilled in order to carry forward the process of development in a balanced manner because education is the basic infrastructure of the all-round development of the country. Since the literacy rate of women is still 12.00% only majority of women are ignorant and uneducated. Therefore special opportunities will be provided to get women educated. Several motivating steps will be taken to increase the admission of girls in the formal educational institutions by fixing quotas in addition to the special programmes to be launched in the areas which are considered backward from the educational viewpoints. Women will be made forward looking by providing necessary facilities and by giving them training tin the field of technical and non technical subjects such as health education agriculture and engineering. Employment opportunities also will be increased for such trained women labour force. Vocational adult and informal education will be provided to the women in addition to the formal education. Improvement will be brought about in the environment and physical facilities for this. 2. Statistics about he health and level of nutrition and mortal age of the women reflect the standard of economic and social development Special efforts are necessary to bring improvement in women\\'s health who have low mortal age and deficiency in nutrition as compared to the women of other developing countries. Hence maternity welfare programmes will be launched as a priority project of health in the seventh plan. But more serious problem is that they are ignorant and do not have the general knowledge on health. since good health and proper nutrition of the family members depend on the mothers it is extremely necessary to have women actively participate in all the programmes in the field of health. In the seventh plan opportunities for providing basic health services will be increased and more women will be participating in the nutrition programmes and health education. To control the population growth rate according to the target of the seventh plan women will have to play an active role. Women will be more involved in family planning and maternity programmes in addition to launching of programmes which will provide opportunities for education and employment for upgrading socioeconomic standard of women. 3. \\tNepal, being an agrarian country, has more women involved in agriculture. Full participation of the women power is highly necessary in agriculture programmes like agriculture publicity and promotion training use of imported seeds and chemical fertilisers improved farming techniques crop survey techniques etc executed for increasing productivity by involving the women in agriculture sector effectively. Hence participation of women will be increased, by determining the quota if necessary in various programmes such as training programmes and increasing production and productivity in the field of agriculture development during the seventh plan. 4. Participation of women will be increased in the field of forest also in addition to agriculture. Their participation in conservation development and growth of forests will be increased. Women will be made more aware and conscious about the many sided benefits to be derived from the well managed forest resources. Because women can contribute remarkably in the cooperative services their participation will be increased in different services to be provided by the cooperative organisations and in all types f training cooperative movement. 5. Nepalese women have limited employment opportunity in non agriculture sector and are employed in low salary jobs only . Appropriate steps will be taken to create more employment opportunity and skills and training will be given in order to improve the socio economic condition of the rural women and low salaried women in particular. Since semi employment is widely prevalent in the pre and post cultivating seasons the women will be properly briefed about the training and employment opportunities for encouraging them to get involved in cottage and village industries in maximum numbers. Vocational training of different industries will be given for increasing their employment and necessary facilities with respect to capital and market will be made available to them and encouragement will be given to carry out these activities through cooperative organizations. 6. Necessary facilities and appropriate training will be given to the limited educated women labor force employed in the government and non -government sectors in encouraging many of them participate in the process of policy formulation. 7. Necessary facilities will be extended to encourage active participation by the non-government sector in addition to the government sector for institutional effectiveness in the programmes related to women development. Since Nepal Women\\'s Association and Women Services Coordination Committee have been playing the important roles with full responsibility for the welfare, protection and upgrading the women community, their contribution will be made more active and time bound. Attempts will be made to extend the participation of Panchayat and non-government organisations in the activities of Women development by activating the Nepal Women\\'s Association units from the village level to the national level. 8. Necessary amendments of acts which make the women participate in the development activities difficult are to be made and in order to upgrade their socio economic standard and necessary arrangements will be made to execute them. CHAPTER 23 Children are the future backbone of country. If all round development of the children takes place from their childhood they will be capable citizens from physical, mental and intelligent consideration in the future. Development of children must be considered at the national level. According to the population census of 1981 child population of age group 0-14 years is 6,211,973 of which 3,227,012 are boys and 2,984,960 are girls. According to this census child population is 41.00% of the total population. Different studies about the situation of children conducted so far points out that child population support the family income by way of important child labor and majority of children have no access to education, health and other facilities and suffer from unbalanced diet. Infant mortality rate is estimated to be still 150 for years 1,000 which is higher as compared to that in other developing countries. Bringing the programmes within the sphere of the plan is very essential to coordinate inter regional programmes which are to be launched under the policy to be framed at the national level for effective implementation for the overall development of the children. The national policy for the development of children will be to provide all at he possible facilities from the stage of womb to grown-up stage for their physical, mental and social development. All facilities will be provided to the children of the country by promoting and gradually developing nutritious food, health, education and other social and economic services. The policy to be adopted for the development of children within the Seventh plan will be as follows. Objectives 1. To develop the children physically, mentally and intellectually. 2. To develop good behavior from the childhood for making the children loyal to the crown, patriotic, disciplined, moral and efficient citizens. 3. To develop the sentiments of the children attached to the recognition of the values based on Nepalese culture and heritage. 4. To make necessary arrangement of protecting the interest and rights of the children. Policies 1. Since the bright futures of the children depend on the parents and guardians, the parents must acquire the first hand knowledge and skill which will be imparted to the children. Publicity and promotion will be carried out for educating the parents for upgrading their knowledge and skill through short -term training, posters, pamphlets and bulletin s for care, health and education of the children and such programmes will be included in health worker, child hospital and maternity welfare programmes. Since child care in not only the responsibility of the parents alone but of the community also, efforts will be made to have public participation in such programmes. 2. A healthy mother gives birth to a healthy body. Since formation of a baby takes place in the womb of the mother, pregnant women need periodic health check, medical care and nutritious food. attempts will be made to make the currently executed programmes for free medical care and child care in the village accessible to pregnant women and mother of newly born babies. 3. Since infant population of age group 0-5 years is vulnerable to diseases and children of this age-group have to be injected against epidemic diseases, D.P.T., B.C.G., vaccinations and polio vaccine and feeding programmes will be expanded and made effective. 4. Essential medicines like gripe water and others will be made easily available at the local health posts for improving health of the rural children and special observation will be carried out about the situation of health and nutrition of the children through the community health workers. 5. Nutritious food directly affects the protection of the health and physical development of the children. For improving the existing nutrition level of children treatment of children having under-nutrition and sales and distribution of nutritious food at proper price for making nutritious food available to the children will be organised. Since programmes related to nutrition are multi-faceted and health, agriculture and education programmes are primarily involved, coordination will be maintained among the concerned institutions. Promotion and publicity activities on priority basis will be carried out through poster, documentary and radio in dissemination the information about nutrition. 6. Expansion of appropriate and properly managed medical services will be effected for the health car of the children on the basis of nutrition system. 7. The system of free distribution of course books to the school children along with the establishment of schools at the appropriate places for providing free primary education will be further organised. Studies will be made to identify the factors which cause the students of the pre-primary and primary schools dropping out and necessary steps will be taken to discourage such actions accordingly. 8. Proper care is essential for the well being of the physical and mental condition of the basis. At the moments the number of such centres established in the urban areas is negligible and hence they will be opened in the urban areas and gradually spread to rural areas in the Seventh Plan. For opening the day child care centres the basis of 25 worming women in one organisation in the industrial estates and in other areas according to population density and the HMG regulations. In the day child care centres babies of 45 days to 3 years of age will be taken care of and nutritious food, primary health facilities and educational toys will be provided. Non-government sectors and private sector will be encouraged to participate more in opening of the day child care centers. 9. Books, magazines useful for the children will be published for propagating national feeling, national festivals, culture, language, customs and other activities in addition to teachings for bringing out the latent ingenuity of the children. 10. Children library, educational child documentary and children swimming pools will be opened for the development of physical and intellectual capacity of the children. Libraries in the primary and middle schools and swimming pools based on the children density will be established. 11. Orphan children will be given skill oriented vocational education in addition to general education in order to make them capable citizens of the country. Bal Mandir, S.O.S. villages, Paropakar Organisations will be improved and expanded to take proper care of the orphan children. 12. Disabled and insane children will be provided with free education and supplied with free course books by giving them skill-oriented programmes in order to rehabilitate them under special education progammes. 13. to safeguard the welfare and security of the children by law child legislation will be formulated and existing acts will be accordingly amended. 14. Government and non-government organisations are involved for running the programmes related to children development because they are many sided. Since there is no coordination among the various projects Project to project and inter-regional-under one institution to the exten required project are passing the buck to each other and programmes have not been executed in other areas. 15. Internal and inter-regional coordination will be maintained effectively by adopting unified process of programme execution in the planned development activities for children development. 16. Special attention will be given to encourage non-government social organizations actively participate in the execution of programmes which are useful to the children and for the welfare of the children. CHAPTER 24 AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT There are indications that the national production target of agriculture sector in the Sixth Plan will be fulfilled. But weather is still playing a direct role in target fulfilment and the situation demands that efforts to increase production should be made all t he more extensive in view of population growth and its impact on consumption. Since agriculture accounts for almost 53 percent of national production and it has still to continue providing employment opportunitie s on a massive scale, the need to assign priority to agriculture sector from national point of view remains conspicuous. 1. Review of the Progress of the Sixth Plan Fulfilment of target is very important in view of the fact that agriculture is the main means of livelihood for the majority of population an it has major contribution to national earnings of the country. Production of major food crops is presented in the Table 24.01. Among food crops the production of paddy exceeded the target to a certain extent. The production of wheat far exceeded the target. . The production of maize is 89.00% of the target, millet 785 barley 86.00% and pulses 88.00%. The productivity of food crops is shown in the Table 24.02. It becomes evident from an analysis of the productivity situation of agriculture crops that is has fallen short of the target of the Plan. But compared to the productivity during the year preceding the commencement of the plan period, paddy, wheat and berley have recorded some increase in productivity whereas maze and millet have lagged behind. It has, therefore, become indispensably necessary to emphasize the urgency of arresting the downward trend in the productivity of common man\\'s main food items, i.e. maize and millet. Though the sales and distribution of the agriculture inputs have increased as compared to the initial years of the plan, they fell far behind the target during the plan period. The main reason for this is that the production inputs and services did not reach the farmers in time. as per schedule because of the weak management and shortfall in irrigation as compared to target. There is plenty of scope to increase production if irrigating facilities along with production inputs can be provided to the farmers in time. The progress in the distribution of improved variety of livestock is presented in the Table 24.08. Distribution of ox, he-buffalo, goats, sheep, exceeded the target in the field of improved livestock .But distribution of chicks, yak and pig fill short of the target . On analysis of the progress situation of the Sixth Plan and obstacles observed during development o agriculture the following points desire consideration :- 1. Improved seed was not widely used and its supply was not made in time and according to target. The objective of development planning is to increase production as far as possible through the maximum use of limited resources and means and the available infrastructure. The government sector has an important role in encouraging the large number of farmer families of the country in role in encouraging the large number of farmer families of the country in influencing the decision making process for the mobilization of resources in the private sector. The field of production has to be classified on the basis of feasibility of increasing agriculture production by concentrating the use of the limited resources and means in foodgrain crops, fruits, vegetables, fish, livestock in feasible areas. Programmes should be launched as a campaign by giving foodgrain top priority and by dividing the arable lands into production blocks for fulfilling the needs of the increasing population and production services and other facilities should be made available to the production block for encouraging the farmers. It is possible to increase production if technical services like distribution system of irrigation water, chemical fertilizer, improved seeds, agriculture loan, crop protection, etc. which support the production programs, are made available to the production blocks according to the needs of the farmer and in time. Though irrigation has been re cognized as one of the important requisites for increasing agriculture production intensive farming has not been able to move ahead because of delay in the expansion of irrigation facilities and the use of the available techniques. Development of all the feasible sources of irrigation as a campaign has been essential. Increasing production by the use of available techniques widely in the areas where irrigation facilities are available is necessary. It is also necessary to give additional attention to supply agriculture inputs by reconsidering the sales and distribution of improved seeds throughout the country through institutional channels responsible for supplying improved seeds to the farmers according to the requirement. The improved seeds sales and distribution must be encouraged by producing the seeds at the farmer level. It is essential to organize the technical services such as agriculture extension, crop protection, soil test, crop technology services and seed inspection and certification in order to execute the agriculture program for producing seeds in a systematic manner and on a wider scale at the farmers level and to make the agriculture research simple, practical and target oriented . Keeping in view the fact that farmers have not been attracted for additional investment in the absence of proper market and price incentives system, and production and productivity have increased wherever improved techniques were used, it is extremely necessary to provide reasonable prices and marketing facilities. Even through production of milk, meat, eggs, fish, fruits has been estimated to be good, their import to a certain extent still exists. Programmes have to be executed in producing those goods for self sufficiency according to the need of the market by discouraging their import. It is necessary to provide required services and facilities for commercial production by developing specific areas for fruits and vegetable gardens by fixing the areas for fruits and vegetables. Execution of programmes to produce fruits of citrus family widely is necessary keeping in view he feasibility of producing fruits in the central hilly area. It has become necessary to give emphasis on increasing production of grass in central hilly areas by silvi-pasture in order to solve the problems of pasture in the northern areas and to reduce the potential pressure on the forest land in view of pasture land becoming a problem for animal feed. For the development of livestock, it is necessary to create proper atmosphere in terms of developing systems for proper price and market for fish, meat, milk and milk products. If it is necessary to give special emphasis to give commercial touch to the fruits and livestock business in order to improve the decaying economic condition of the hills and for strengthening the inter-relation of hills and terai on the basis of geographical feasibilities for increasing agriculture production, it is equally necessary to enhance self -reliance by increasing the foodgrains production in the hills by utilising feasible hill bases to the maximum because transport problem will not be solved in he immediate future for supplying the foodgrains to the Hilly Region. Executions of programmes for increasing national earning is extremely essential for increasing production in the Terai Region because this area is more feasible for foodgrain and industrial crops. Land reform programme should be formulated and so directed that it will create atmosphere for attracting investment for increasing production because utilisation of agriculture land has a major influence in agriculture production. In spite of the fact that land owner exceed the land tillers in number, farming has not taken the shape of commercial farm. Since regional balance has not been maintained by diverting the savings from agriculture to industrial sector, the land reforms programmes should be carried forward in order to develop institutional farming by encouraging the arming on contract, etc. It won\\'t be possible of attain the target in the absence of the systems which will scrutinize plan and programmes and projects for fulfilling various production targets, their execution according of the target within the deadline, obstacles and problems during execution, achievements, forms of future plans and programmes. The process of evaluation and monitoring should continue and this process should cover from the project level to the national level on a regular basis. In order to make the evaluation and monitoring of plans effective it is essential to integrate it with the reward and punishment system. By mobilisation of the local leadership agriculture programmes can be executed in a more effective manner because agriculture programmes are the programmes of farmers\\' clear cut participation. Formulation, execution, follow-up and evaluation of agriculture development programmes to be executed in each district should be done at the district level by organising a production group consisting of representatives from all institutions related to agriculture in each district and also system of execution, follow-up, evaluation of agriculture programmes through the service centres by the production group should be introduced from the district level itself. 3. Objective of the Seventh Plan Keeping the above background in mind the objectives of the agriculture development for meeting the needs of the country will be as given below:- a.Production of food will be increased on a steady basis to meet the demand of the continuously increasing population and also or increasing the consumption level. The target of production of foodgrain has been fixed by including quantity of foodgrain required for population growth rate, increase in income and also for export. The existing per capita consumption of foodgrains of 159Kg. will be increased to 174 Kg at the end of the Seventh plan. The production target of foodgrain, cash crops, fruits, fish, meat milk and major agriculture production is presented in the Table 24.09 and Table 24.09(a) 1. Crop programme:- Keeping in mind the increasing internal demand and quantity required for export, the following special arrangements will be made in order to launch the production programme for main foodgrains like paddy, maize and wheat in the form campaign 1.1 \\tProductive inputs like ferilisers, seeds, insecticides, agriculture loans, etc. will be delivered at site in the production spots in the special and pocket regions according to the priority of the programmes for increasing the production. In other areas these inputs will be supplied to service centers before the farming season. For this purpose distribution of production inputs will be carried on in different areas under the following classifications:- large areas with irrigation facilities will be called special areas, small and scatterd areas with irrigation facilities will be called pocket areas, and those without irrigation facilities and dependent on monoon where increase in production is feasible will be called general regions. Areas that can not be directly served under the programme will be classified as other regions, for crops other than paddy, maize and wheat in the special, pocket and general areas agriculture inputs and services will be allocated area-wise on the basis of feasibility. Paddy Production Programme As there is no room for increasing the area under paddy cultivation the predominant foodgrain of  emphasis will be focused on increase in productivity. Hence the target for production o chaite/bhadai ya and summer paddy is fixed at 3.40 million metric tons from an area o 1.334 million hectares for both crops. From this paddy production will increase by 667,000 metric tons as compared to the base year For attaining this target the overall productivity of 2.01 metric tons of paddy per hectare will be raised to 2.50 metric tons per hectare. The following arrangements will be made in executing this programme : a. The paddy production programme will be implemented by dividing the areas into major irrigated area minor irrigated area partial irrigated area or the area dependent on monsoon water sources and other areas dependent on weather into special pocket general and other areas respectively. Available means and resources will be utilised in these areas on a priority basis. Similarly summer crops should be so selected that these crops do not adversely affect winter crops in the areas where winter crops will be planted. For the supply of sees government farm stations will produce 700 metric tons of foundation seeds during the plan period. Seed breeding programmes and seed inspecting and certification services will be made effective for increasing the supply of seeds at the farmer level. Institutional distribution activities will be concentrated on the seeds which will increase production. For propagating the popularity of improved seed techniques mini-kit distribution programme will be executed. ii) \\tChemical feritlisers - Chemical ferilisers will be extensively used in the areas where continuous irrigation water is available. In order to maintain the quality of soil the use of compost fertiliser will be encouraged in the irrigated areas and other areas. Emphasis will be given on the use of chemical fertilisers in specials and pocket areas. Use of proportion of Nitrogen phosphorous and potash will be gradually increased o a level of 60:20:20 under special programmes 40:15:15 under pocket programmes and 30:10:10 under general programmes. se of ferilisers in other areas also will be encouraged. Social emphasis will be given to increased use of zinc and agri-lime in order to increase the effectiveness of ferilisers. iii) \\tIrrigation water - Water distribution working groups with the public participation will be organised for distribution of irrigation water through the irrigation drains / canals keeping in mind the fact that only timely supply of water can improve productivity. Necessary arrangement will be made when government irrigation projects are regular repaired and maintained to see to agriculture works are not adversely affected. By completing tube-well boring and small irrigation works and drain construction works additional irrigation facilities will be provided to 20,000 hectares of land every year. e. \\tThus 560,000 metric tone of paddy under special programmes 595,000 metric tons under pocket programmes and 839,000 metric tons under general programmes add up to 1,994,000 metric tons from the areas covered by those programmes wih 1,406,000 metric tons from other areas not directly influenced by those programme s this makes a total of 3,400,000 metric tons of paddy. Annual break-down of the target of paddy production during the Seventh Plan is presented in Table 24.10 Maize Production Progamme Maize occupies the second in the overall production o foodgrains in the country. There is no room for expanding the area of maize crop also and so emphasis has to be given or the increase of productivity in particular. To execute the maize production program as a campaign the target of producing 936,000 metric tons from 556,000 hectares is fixed for the plan period. As compared to the base year this programme will produce additional 73,000 metric tons of maize . For fulfilling this target the existing productivity of maize of 1,52 metric tons per hectare will be increased to 1.65 metric tons per hectare. To increase the maize production according to the target from this programme the following steps will be taken : a. Maize crop development also will be executed by dividing programme into special pocket general and other programmes . Special program will be implemented in valley maize area in the hills and winter and spring season maize areas in the Terai. Similarly in hilly and terai areas where transportation facilities exist summer maize will be cultivated under pocket programme and in other areas in the hills services will be provided by the programme to 216,000 in the hills services will be provided by the programme to 216,000 hectare under general programme and he remaining areas under other programmes. Available resources and means will be mobilsed according to priority under special pocket general and other programmes. b. While implementing the programme this way in the areas under special programme production of 2.79 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 3.40 metric tons per hectare under pocket programme 1.68 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 1.62 metric tons per hecare and ndr other programme 1.44 metric tons per hectare will be raised o 1.45 metric tons per hectare. c. \\tUtilization of improved seed chemical fertilisers and crop protection materials which have a direct bearing on the increase of maize production will be carried out as follows: The required quantity of seeds for the general programme will be supplied by the private sector by supplied by the private sector by supporting the seed breeding programme. 20% of the certified seeds required by the seed men programme. Other seeds will be supplied by farmers them to seed breeding programme will be carried out under seed processing and development programme. Maize mini-kit programme will be implemented in order to popularise the use of improved seeds and techniques. ii) Crop protection - Crop protection services will be made more effective because maize production is greatly affected by insects. Crop protection units and service centres will be made active in saving the losses for increasing the production by observing the use of chemicals in the soil prior to farming and when the plants grow. Priority will be given to the use of chemical fertilisers in connection with soil nutrition according to the intensively of the programme. In the special areas the proportion of nitrogen and phosphorous will be 90L\\\\:45 kg. for he Terai Region and 60:30 kg per hectare in the Hilly Region. Similarly under normal programme nitrogen will be supplied at the rate of 23 kg per hectare to a minimum of 50% of programme area. Special programmes will be implemented o encourage the use of compost fertiliser to maintain the quality of soil . In other regions use of compost fertilisers will be emphasized. d. \\tIn the Terai Region extension of tube-well irrigation to 50,000 hectares and other minor irrigation to 10,000 hectares will bring a minimum of 12,000 hectares for winter and spring maize and raise production by 36,000 metric tons. Fro m the above mentioned approach under special area 86,000 metric tons under pocket area 89,000 metric tons under general programmes 351,000 metric tons and under her programmes of 390,000 metric tons making a total of 916,000 metric tons of maize will be produced during he plan period. The target of this production according to development regions and geographical sub-regions is given in details in the Table 24.13. Wheat Production Programme Wheat occupies the third place in the overall production of foodgrains in he country. In the campaign for raising production of foodgrains production of wheat also has to play a significant role. target is fixed to produce 900,000 metric tons from 563,000 hectares by raising both the area and productivity in the plan period. Accordingly 300,000 metric tons of additional wheat will be produced during the plan period. For his production growth productivity of 1.37 metric tons per hectare in he base ear will be raised o 1.60 metric tons power hectare in the final year of the plan period. To increase the wheat production according to the target from this programme the following steps will be taken :- a. There is enough room to expand the area under wheat cultivation and additional production can be attainder 126,000 hectares which may be added by the new irrigation system. b. Since the need to increase productivity has to be empasised as expansion of area alone would notadequately increase production, in the special area the base year productivity of 2.95 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 3.20 metric tons per hectare in he final year of the plan period in he pocket area productivity of 1.70 metric tons will be raised to 2.30 metric tons per hectare in the general area 1.38 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 1.46 metric ones per hectare and in other areas production will be raised from 0.58 metric tons per hectare to 0.66 nitric tons per hectare. i) \\tImproved seeds Emphasis is o be given for selecting new varieties and their uses because continuous use one variety of seed brings deterioration in quality and vulnerability though improved seeds are mostly used in wheat cultivation Rs 29 has aided a big popularity. Bu the decline in productive and resistance capacity of this variety compels its replacement. For the Terai Region emphasis will be given in he use of varieties like Tribeni Lumbini Vinayak Vaskar and Siddhartha. Use of UP 262 and Tribeni will be emphas ised in the hills. In he higher altitude use of term 52 because of its popularity will be encouraged mini kit programme will be implemented for he wheat also in order to populraise the use of new seeds and techniques. Major portion of the seed supply will be met by the private sector by making seed inspection and certification services active through the seed breeding programmes. Emphasis will be given to encourage seeds through institutional seed distribution when old variety of seeds have o be replaced. Since it is not possible to produce adequate quantity of certified seeds in the government farms alone during the plan period selected seed producing farmers will be associated in the production of seeds. This way 5,000 metric tons of certified seeds will be produced at the central level. ii) \\tChemical fertilisers Special emphasis will be given to encourage use of adequate wuantity of chemicl fertilisers in improving productivity. Awareness will be brought for continuous use of compost fertilisers for maintaining the quality of soil. In the special area the use of nitrogen phospherous and potash will be gradually increased to reach 80:40:20 kg per hectare during the Sevenh plan period. in the pocket area 60:30:20 kg. per hectare in the general area 50:25:0 kg per hectare andin other areas effors will be made for increasing the use of fertilisers. iii) \\tIrrigation water Wheat crop does not need continuous suppl of water but water is needed at rhe right time. Hence water users groups will be organised with the participation of the people in order to make the effetive distribution of water from te irrigation project . Coordination will be brought aout between irrigation programme and agriculture programmes to avoid hampering the farming during the period ofrepair and maintance of irrigation projects. In additionto normal irrigation programmes since the aim is to irrigate 40,000 hectare by construction of small irrigation schemes in th hills and irrigate additional 60,000 hectares by tube well boring and constructio n of small irrigation projects in the terai Region in winter wheat crop will receive 25% of water from the construction of irrigation projects and 60% from the tube well . In the additional irrigated lands providing production services facilities in a package from to the farmer will help support the efforts for sel reliance by producting additional 14,000 metric tons of wheat in the hills and speeial contributionwill be masde in increasing production by producing additional 40,000 meric tons in the otal target of the terai. c. \\tWith this production programme prodction of 272,000 metric tons from special programme 241,000 metric tons from pocket programme and 256,000 metric tons from general programme will make a toal of 769,000 mtric tons.Adding 131,000 mteric tons to this from the areas not receiving the services the total will be 900,000 metric tons. The target of annal production of wheat during theSeventh plan period is persented in the Table 24.16 Table 24.17 and Table 24.18. d. \\tMillet/Hog Millet Production Programme e. \\tMostly millet / hog millet used by the low income group as a daily food are clutivated in less fertile arcas in the hills. Since improved techniques have not been developed for this crop its productivity has been dwindiling. Hence assuming that the area will not expand during theplan period the traget is fixed at produce 120,000 me5ic tons from 124,000 hectares of land. The following steps will be taken to increase the production :- a. Production inputs and services required or millet crops will be supplied under e general programme through the nearest service centres in a package from. For executing the programme successfully planing monitoring evaluation and other measures will also be taken for this crop as necessary. b. By the third year of the plan new variety of seeds will be selected and programme will be implemened from the fourth year. d. \\tTesting will be conducted at the farms for seed breeding b selecting improved seeds presently recommended and varieties recommended for the hilly regions. Insecticides to stop wire worm and army worm found in this crop will be used. f. \\tA separate unit will bee stablished for development of hilly crops like millet hog millet braley buck wheat etc. under crop development programme . This unit will concentrate on developmen of techniques for millet / hog millet crops. g. \\tProgrammes for cultivation of amaranthus which has not been used as foodgrains so far but contains more nutritious elements and gives high yields in the marginal lands and hilly areas will be implemented after necessary studies. h. \\tSince no technique has been developed for the use of chemical fertiliser compost fertilizers will be encouraged. Annual production targets of millet according to millet production programme during the plan period is given in the Table 24.19. Barley Production Programme Barley also is one of he crops cultivated in less fertile land. There has been no improvement in the area, production and productivity of the erop because improed techniques have not been applied to this crop so far. Assuming that there will be no expansion of land production target of 25,000 meric tons is fixed from the area of 25,000 hectares. For this production programme base year productivity of 0.90 metric tons per ecare will be rised to 1.00 metric ton per hectare during the plan period. The following steps will be taken to fulfil the production target :- a. Necessary prodction inputs and services for this crop will be made available under the general programme through the nearest sevice centres in coordinated way. b. By the third year of the plan selection of improved seeds will be completed and emphasis will be given to use the selected seeds as much as possible. Selected seeds will be tested approved by the farmers at the farmer\\'s levels. Parent seed required for this and the certified seeds will be produced by the government farm and stations. Mini-kit programme will be implemented for popularising te use of recommended seeds. c. \\tHilly crop development unit will be helpful for development of bck wheat barley etc. d. \\tTo protect the crop from rust disease and black smut use of disease resistant seeds will be encouraged . e. \\tSince techniques have not been developed for the use of chemical fertilisers for this crop use of compost fertilisers will be encouraged. f. \\tEvaluation monitoring and incentive system for the program will be designed or the crop as necessary. g. \\tProgramme for increasing production of malt variety ofbarley used by the growing breweries of hecountry will be implemented The annual production target of the barley production programmes is presented in the Table 24.20 Prodction Taget of Barley in the Seventh Plan Pulses production programme The contribution of pulses is rather significant in providing ehe nrtiritious elements to the population. it is extremely necessary to give special emphasis on increasing production of certal crops because of the wide use of pulse in the dali food and the increasing contribution of lentil in the exportable pulses. In view of the fact, base year production of 88,000 metic tons of pulses will be rased to 95,000 metrication in the Seventh plan. Area of 226,000 hectares will be expanded to 230,,000 hectares. Thus productivity of 0.68 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 0.74 metric tons per hectare. a. Tea production programme will be clssified into special and general programmes. Thus 28.00 metric tons of pure honey will be produce from the programme areas in the plan period. Technical services and agriculture implements required for the proposed programme will be provided through the nearest service centres under the supervision of the district production team. a. Emphasis will be given to the production of ginger in Bhaktapur Palpa, Syangja, Tanahun, Kaski, Salyan, etc among the important spices. Purification process at Biratnagar center will be strengthened for providing collecting services at Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari , Saptari, Siraha and Hetauda center for providing collecting services at Dhanusha, Mahotari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara, Parsa, By increasing the grazing areas making water supply available and preserving the hay production area near the villages grass production in the rainy season will be increased. 1. Supply of improved seeds will be made prompt in cases where the supply is made through institutional channels for use of new variety and for replacing the existing low quality seed by improved variety. 2. Private sector will be made active for increasing production by providing seed technology and certification services for marketing and distribution of proven improved seeds . For the seeds required for the areas covered by the district programme will be supplied by making self-sufficient with increased production at the farmer level by providing agriculture programme services. 3. Foundation seed required for increasing seed production will be supplied from production of different agriculture farms and stations for shortfalls. if any the selected farmers will been courage to produce certified seeds by providing necessary services. The existing practice of subsidy and loans which are being made available for promoting storage in the hilly areas is emphasized by foodgrains production programme for storage of seeds for supporting the supply of improved seeds at the local level. The institutional marketing and distribution and seed breeding programme according to different main crops for the proposed production of improved seeds will be as presented in the Table 24.63 / 25.64. 3. Supply of Fertilisers It is very necessary to use fertilisers to maintain the level of nutrients in the soil because these nutrients in the soil have major contribution in increasing productivity of the agricultural crops from the limited land. Because of t he weightage of the production programmes the crops consume the nutrients very fast and recouping these nutrients by compost fertiliser being slow it is essential to maintain the fertility of the soil by the use of chemical fertilisers. In this context in the areas which are given priority by the integrated farming or in the special and pocket areas use of chemical fertiliser will be given priority. Use and supply of fertilisers in the Seventh Plan will be as follows :- Emphasis will be given to increase the availability and use of compost fertiliser in all the programme areas because its use not only maintain the quality of the soil but also vive nutrients to the crops. Against this background where chemical fertilisers are becoming costly publicity and promotion of techniques for preparing and use of compost fetiliser will be carried out for enriching the soil by nutrients by the use of compost fertilisers. Establishment of compost fertilisers plants will greatly support the marketing and distribution of quality compst fertiliser. Transport subsidy on the basis of recommendations of the technical committee will be given for maximum use of quality compst fertiliser and qanimal fertiliser by reducing the imported fertiliser. 2. Use of Chemical Fertiliser Since chemical fertiliser is not produced in the country and there is less possibility of producing it in adequate qnantity in the near future, it is essential to use it in the most judicious manner to gain maximum benefit from limited supplies. Hence marketing and distribution of chemical fertilisers will be undertaken in right quantity in order to attain maximum production. The policy ofgiving transport subsidy will be adopted according to the production programme for increasing production from the areas which do not have transport facilities. In the special and pocket areas where irrigation facilities exist provision will be made for supplying chemical fertilisers. The policy will be grant some concessions on the price of chemical fertilisers where the farmer will be encouraged to use in the new areas. 3. Availabilty of chemical fertilisers will be ensured according to the priority fixed by the crop programme before the season by strengthening the supply and distribution of chemical fertiliser. Cooperative organisation will be given priority byassociating the private sector also in the marketing and distribution of chemical fertilisers. The traget of supplying the chemical fertilisers according to the above programme during the Seventh Plan is presented in the Table 24.65 and Table 24.66. Agriculture Loan Agriculture loan big role to play in making financial sources available to the farmers in assisting the production programme for increasing agriculture production. The agriculture loan made available to the farmers through institutional channels has greatly helped release the burden off the farmers from paying high interest rates to the traditional merchants. Special emphasis will be given to exe cute loan and investment for giving benefit to at least 59% of the farmer families in the Seventh plan. Loan and investment programme will be executed as a composite package with special priority to the irrigation facilities, agriculture implements marketing processing in supporting the fulfilment of target during the Seventh Plan. Special emphasis will be given to make loans available to the fruits farming considering the requirements from the plantation stage to the production stage on a long term basis in a package. To increase the production capacity of the small farmers small framer development project will be extended to all the 75 districts and its number will be increased to 230 during the plan period by investing on the programme which will generate opportunities for employment to improve the economic condition of the small farmers. While employing workers in such small farmer development projects 40 workers will be women and in the new projects 25% of the workers will be women for increasing the women participation. Thus the existing projects and the new projects will be encouraged to function as an autonomous body for which small farmers will be encouraged to run the project as a cooperative or an association. While executing the loan and investment programme due consideration will be given to disburse the loan to the farmers ahead of the farming season. These loans will be disbursed to the farmers on the spot in the special and pocket programme areas . The policy will be to invest loans through the cooperatives by giving them priority. The target is to invest Rs 3,863,800,000 in loans during the plan period which is more than double the amount invested in the Sixth plan. For good turnover loan realisation will be made more effective. In the urban and rural areas savings collection will be mobilised development bonds will be issued commercial banks will make available finances to the Agricultural Development Bank loans and second mortgage will be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank. Loan amounts to the projects under multi lateral assistance will be channeled through the Agricultural Development Bank. Investment projections on different projects are presented in the Table 24.67. Insecticides In the period from the time seeds and saplings of different crops are planted in the soil to the time of harvest diseases and insects destroy the crops. During the Seventh Plan. insecticides being one of the items of crop protection will be provided for increasing the production and productivity in special and pocket areas specifically emphasised by the programme by protecting the crops from the attack by the diseases and insects, in other areas the main way of increasing the production is to protect the crop from diseases and insects. Such insecticides will be used by activating the crop protecting servises. 124,000 litres liquid and 6,400 metric tons of power insecticides required during the Seventh plan will be made available through institutional channels. Constant effort will be put to supply the insecticides through the institutional channels in the areas without transport facilities and in the areas which can be cultivated immediately. In Other areas private sector will supply. Agriculture Implements Agriculture implements have a very important role to increase the production by saving time by making the farmer effcient. Against this background, if less time is consumed in ploghinghing , harrowing, grading, threshing, processing.etc. crop turnover in thelimited land will be more resulting in increased production and employment opportunity. Emphasis will be given to manufacture simple andscientific implements required for farming and appreciated by the farmers. Marketing anddistribution of Rs 17,650,000 worth ofsmall agriculture implements will be carried out during the seventh plan. Scientific agriculture implements like plough, seed drill thresher etc. which have direct impact on increasing production in the areas accorded priority by agriculture production programmes will bemarketed at concessional rates. Agri-lime Emphasis willbegiven to use gri-line as a part of agriculture goods inconsultation with thesoil analysis progrmme for neutralising the soil acidity which advesely effectsthe production, that is to use 21,000 metric tons of agri-line during the plan period. Thesubsidy pressently give in the use of agriculture will continue. Storage of Agriculture Goods With the increase in the supply of agriculture goods storage facilities also have to be added andso additional godowns will be construfted in the areas which are accorded priority by theproduction programme .During the plan period godwons with the capacity of 29,000 metric tons will be added. From fhis the present capacity of64,456 metric tons will be raised to 93,456 metric tons. Production Services Agriculture Publicity Taking into consideration of the active role of house wives or women ingriculture women\\'s activities affairs coordinators programme at the deprtmental level will be organised for making women\\'s participation effective. District production will be established with the representation of all institutions related to agriculture development in each district for providing production inputs and services to meet the requirement of farmers in making agriculture publicity if formation effective. The objective of all the institutions related to agriculture development of the district will be so framed that their common objective is to attain the agriculture production fixed for the district. Such groups will scrutinize all the production programmes of the district and their responsibility is to formulate execute send the report to the centre by evaluating at the district level. The secretariat of the production group will be at the district agriculture development office. reward and punishment will be related to the attainment of the target set for the district. Service centers will be organized by taking into consideration the weightage of the district production programme for their effectiveness. At these centres basic infrastructures such as crop protection materials, implements, soil analysis kits, fertiliser, seeds, marketing, loan investment and technical assistance will be made available. District production teams will implement the production programmes through these s ervice centers. Production services in the form of a package will be provided to the farmers on the spot in the special and pocket areas through the services centres. Training and supervision services will be provided to the farmers through these servic e centres by determining production blocks of 100 hectares each or accoeding to the requirement of the panchayat in a package from for which one agr4iculture assistant or panchayat level agriculture assistant will be assigned. These assistants will be evaluated on the basis of improved techniques being used in their respective areas. In the orchard having 25 hectares one trained agriculture assistant will be proviede. Such training programmes or supervision programmes will be carried out in the farms of the farmers. While training is given among the new recruits of agriculture assistants 10% of them will be women. Also for travels and seminars organised for the farmers 10% participation will be given to women. Since regional directorate are not effective because they have to supervise may districts with regard to monitoring and direction of district production programme, instead of this zonal level agriculture information offices will be established to monitor and direct the district production programme effectively. In addition, district agriculture development offices will be strengthened technically. information and coordination, training and manpower development and planning and evaluation at the departmental level will be consolidated. Agriculture extension will be made more practical by consolidating agriculture information services during ath plan period. Necessary support will be given to involve rural youth programme with the training of farmers in order to expose the new generation towards improved techniques for agriculture development. Important activities on agriculture publicity programme for fulfilling the production target in the Seventh Plan by the agriculture publicity services programme in brief is given below:- 1. To attain the set agriculture production target. 2. To provide production inputs and services to the farmenrs in time to attain the target set. 3. Inproved techniques for agriculture production will be widely publicized by exhibition of result and methods, agriculture workshop, agriculture tours and discoursed., distribution of booklets, training of farmers, radio programme, competition of production. 4. To organise competition of crop production from service centre level to the national level and to reward the excellent farmer and one month allowance will be given as token of encouragement additionally to the agriculture assistant on the basis of attaining the set production targer. 5. Production programme will be monitored and evaluated at every stage. Crop Technique Service Within the command area of different farms station problems will be studied on the spot at the production areas and services will be provided From these farms for solving them. Necessary services will be provided according to the weightage at the program for the areas outside the catchment area of these farm stations. Crop Protection Services Since crop protection service has an important role it will be more effective by increasing the crops by protecting the from dieseases and insects, birds, rats, etc. In addition ot the crop protection units in different form stations additional crop protection units will be established in different form Stations during the plan period. These units will be developed by equipping them with equipments, chemical including laboratory services, for these crop protection officer in the district agriculture development office and technicians in other district service centres will be deputed. Local JTA/JT, Agriculture Assistant will be trained on crop protection and theyt will be mobilised for prevention of diseasse and insects. For the crop protection services for organising the central crop protection office looking after programme formulation, coordination and supervision, organsational improvement will be brought about by keeping all the employees of all groups who take part in crop protection in the field of insects and diseases. Therfore, by agriculture publicity it means not only the publicity of agriculture techniques alone but all the efforts combined in a package form also in order to make the production programme successful. Soil Analysis Service The soil analysis service is extremely important for recommending the type and dose of fertilisers by testing, analylsis and study of the fertility power of the soil because it is the most impotant input in maintaining the nutrients of the soil and recommending the require ingredients to neutralise the unnecessary and destructive elements in the soil. Since chemical fertilisers have to be importaed their use has to be done in the wisest possible manner. In tis context, soil analysis services will be used in order to attain the target of agriculture porduction in an integrated manner with the agriculture production programme in making it effective during the Seventh Plan. Soil analysis services will be production group in fulfilling the production target according to special , pocket and normal programme areas in order of priority. Soil analysis services will be made more elaborate by training the technical assistants and agriculture assistants of the service centers in the use of the soil analysis kits in testing soil. To provide the services by making the soil analysis more effective existing soil analysis units in different places and additional units in Janakpur, Surkhet, Jumla and Doti will be strengthened. Government farms and government institutions alone connot play the adequate role in the production of seed. They will be directed to be busy in predicting new Varity of improved seeds and production of high quality seeds for substituting the aged seeds. Governments farms will produce foundation seed and some certified seeds and through Agricultural Inputs Corporation production of certified seeds will be increased. Selected farmers will be associated in these activities by training them on techniques for determining purity, selecting highly fertile seeds, storage, etc. for associating the private sector in increasing the production and marketing and distribution of improved seeds which have been recognised. Seed testing, seed crop inspection and seed certification for the farmers involved in the seed breeding programme will be carried out under the seed techniques and development services. For making the seed technique and certification services effective seed testing laboratories will be added at Khairenitar, Hardinath and Dang and the existing laboratories together eight laboratories will be strengthened. Are units in 7 places like Bhojpur, Kankai, Kavre, marfa, Rampur Doti and Kanchanpur will be organized. Districts covered by the programme will be made self-sufficient by effective operation of these units in providing quality seed development services. Thus supply of improved seeds will be made to the farmers in time thus creating the atmosphere in establishing seed processing industries by making the private sector capable in seed production and distribution. Seed technique and development services will be provided through the nearest service centre in the area according to priority given by the agriculture production programmes in consulting with the district production groups. Such services will be available from the above mentioned laboratories and area units as well. To make the seed technique and developemnt services effcetive and consolidate the seed programme necessary improvement will be brought in the central organisational matters. Activites related to high class seed committee. separate category for the employees of seed technolo0gy and development services will be properly organised under this programme. Training Programme Training will be very medium for increasing agriculture production by using the inputs and techniques widely by giving training on different subjects to the workers of different levels involved in agriculture development activities for the seccessful implementation of the agriculture production programme. The following arrangement will be made in executing the training programme also with the production programme in the Seventh Plan:- 1. Duplication will be eliminated by evaluating the training programmes and training centers. 2. Training programmes will be effectively executed by reducing the 39 training centres to 10. Realising the need of providing preservice training to the new officer recruits and periodic officer training on etraining centre will be fully equipped to give taining on all subjcets and the other training centres will be developed to provide training on subjcets according the need of the area where agriculture programme is implemented. 3. Syllabus and course materials will be developed by the training experts in consulation with the programme experts and speciialists. The training centres will be fully equipped with physical infrastructure for making the training programme more practical supported by experimental exercises. 4. In farming since woment are attentive than men facilities will be increased in each training to encourage women to take part in training including construction of hostel. 5. Training and manpower development will be strengthened for executing training programme in a well org anized manner by assessing the requirement for different programmes. Programme will be implemented in a coordinated manner in such a way that concerned programmes will furnish the materials required for Their respective subjects such as foodgrain crops, cash crops, fruits and vegetable and fish development in carrying out training programme for different levels. Agriculture Research and Technique Development To increase the agriculture production according to the need of the dountry is tis extemely neces sary to use appropriat techniqies. Dynamic research programme is necessary to develop improved techniques for use by the farmers according to needs. it is eextremely necessary to execute agriculture research prgramme as complimentary to agriculture publicity for developing a technique which is simple, easy to apply and matching to condition of the farmer by studying the problems cropped up while the recommended techniques are used by the farmers. Agrainst this background agriculture research and technique development programme will be implemented with a clear cut direction. For this research programme will be implemented in the following manner:- 1. In the sixth plan even though emphasis was given that research farms were given specified areas for research in the farm and external services in the command area but lack of clear cut direction could not make services and research works effective, and also because the research works carried were only to the interest and capacity of the researchers more than meeting the specific requirement. 2. For implementing the agriculture research and development progrtamme by activating the inactive research coordination committee in the form of national agriculture research coordination committee in the Ministry of Agriculture consisting of , National Council of Science and Technology will be set up. 3. Research panels will be set up to carry out the function of the secretariat of the agriculture research coordination committee in the field of agriculture animal development, animal health and socio-economic study. In these panels concerned specialists will be nominated and these panels will prepare the clear cut research projcets which will solve the shor-term and long-term problems for increasing th eproduction taking into consideration the problems faced yb the farm station and as pointed out by agriculture publicity programme, and these projects Will be included in the annual programme after ratification by the national agriculture research coordination committee and the research panel will identify the person who will take the reponsiblility of executing the research project and the research will be carried out through the appropriate farm stations 4. Research works specified by the committee only will be carried out in the research farms and stat ions. In such research activities the responsible person will not be held responsible for the services to be provided to the command area of the farm stations. By deputing research assistants in the research farms for providing the external services in the command area through these assistants, research will be experimented in the farmers\\' fields, technical advice will be provided for crop development, results of experiments from the fields of the farmers will be communicated to farm researches and these assistants will be held responsible for the researches which are related to the farmers\\' fields. 5. The budge allocation made for the research project approved by the national agriculture research coordiantion committee will establish a clear situation for correct assessment of the investment or research and its achievement by eliminating the vaguenes of the existing investyment in the research farm station. 6. The existing central research unit at Khumaltar will be achivated by reoganising it in the form of national research centre and it will be developed as a source centre for the research panels in issuing direction by monitoring and evaluating all the research and technical services of al the farms and station. In the main units related to relatd to researches of the national agriculture, research ecntre with subject-wise division, major crop development programme and agriculture farm and stations will be established. 7. To make the proposed research and technique development prgramme dynamic, existing centres will be recorganised and consolidated. The activities of the research farms will be clearly spelt by classifying them into research farm, service oriented farm and service and commercial farms. Agriculture Price and Market Development To derive the expected results from the proposed additional investment for increasing production, the produced goods must receive proper price and market. Priority will be given in the Seventh plan to give fair price and market for the agriculture goods produced for encouraging increased investment and effort for increasing the production. Of the goods produced since some surplus will be available for marketing, proper price and marketing will be guaranteed for 15% of the total marketable quantity of the major agriculture product every year. For issuing this guarantee the following steps will be taken: - 1 \\tOne advisory committee will be set up consisting of experts for counselling His Majesty\\'s Government on approved prices every year by constant study of the cost of production, comparative benefits and selling prices of the agriculture products. Against the present practice of fixing price by different institutions, responsibility will be given to this committee for fixing the price of all agriculture products and toimplement this price and study its effectiveness. 2 \\tFixation of approved price will be done on the basis of goods promoted by agriculture programme and high classified goods and special quality or variety goods. The farmers will be informed about the approved prices of the specified crops well ahead of the farming season in order to enable them to formulate their production plan. 3 \\tStudy programmes will be implemented in order to make the expert committee with regard to approved price on farming expenses, on crop conditions, pre -crop condition, supply of foodgrains and consumption and so on according to necessity. 4 \\tArrangement will be made to fix the responsible central institution to buy the agriculture at the approved price or to buy at the market centre or depot when majority of the farmers sell their produce at the approved price fixed by the consolidation of Nepal Food corporation. Thus if the farmer can increase the source of their income by selling the small surplus this will also bring a definite supply position by the institutional procurement of agriculture produce enabling to maintain a certain level of quantity and quality for export trade as well. 5 \\tFor marketing of agriculture produce at the coordination of the central institution market will be established for the farmers at the production spot where village level cooperatives are there and where cooperative do not exist through the private agents. 6 \\tHaat market development programme will be implemented for establishing local market ad for organising commercial centers and haat markets and developing market facilities. Special priority will be given to develop wholesale market on the weightage of the programme in the area which specifically emphasised by foodgrain production programme. Wholesale market will be developed in a coordinated manner by giving priority to milk and livestock production areas receiving top priority from livestock developmetn programme, urban areas and areas near th ehighway where special programme is implemented under fruit production programme, area where potato is used as staple food and special programme area near market and having transport facilties under potatoes development programme, vegetable production project area for meeting the demand of the urban area nder vegetable production programme, on the basis of market feasibility. 16 \\tChassification and certification services of the agriculture goods which come into the internal and external market after determining quality level will be implemented with the agriculture produce marketing programme in a composite manner. Emphasis will be given to maintain quality, goodwill and reliability in the internal and external markets. 9 \\tFood Technology Development Food research quality control and nutrition researh and development programme will be given appropriate priority in the Seventh Plan, for studing the composition of nutrients in the available food , for developing the methods of processing foodgrains, vegetable, fruits and pulses, for improving the nutritious condition of the people through publicity and promotion because such activities affect the people through publicity and promotion because such activities affect the internal and external market and price of agriculture production, for supporting collection of information on market and price and for increasing the agriculture production. under food research programme, appropriateness of the processed agriculture goods use the new and existing technology, processing activities will be developed in the private sector through publicity and promotion and training. Grinding coffee seeds into powder in Gulmi, establishing processing industry, installing equipment for processing coffec seeds in Palpa and Arghakhanchi, for developing cellar stores for storing potatoes, technical services will be provided to private sector. Special emphasis will be given to establish industries in the major areas where fruits will be produced. Potato development programme will produce appropriate variety of potatoes for producting potato chips, and for processing it into making powder. The above mentioned programme will be implemented in the aresa which are accorded priority by agriculture production programme along with production programme in an integrated manner. Considering the market problem because of the constraint of transport in the Hilly Region for developing fruit small scale units for processing and storage will be established in the orchard by providing technical advice and making training programme effective. Service-oriented programme will be implemented in order ot determine the quality standerd according to laws by analyzing the processed goods. During the plan period the total production of major foodgrains will be 5,370,000 metric tones, Consumable quantity of this production will be 3,400,000 metric tons. On the basis of the capacity of supply of production inputs and mobilisation according to the target, per capita consumption will be 174kg. Provions will be made to distribute improved seeds and crop protection materials effectively, to provide the agriculture inputs and agriculture extension services to the farmens through service centre for supporting the increase of local production whereby the need for distribution of foodgrains will be gradually reduced. In the high hills since there is no scope for further increase of foodgrain production, its supply has to be increased. Since foodgrain is in surplus in Terai, surplus of terai and pocket areas of the Hilly region will be sold by the surplus owners. Because of geographical conditions all the areas do not have adequate foodgrains and since a major portion of the Hilly Region has transport problem and because of lack of free market supply is not regular and special arrangement has to be made for supplying foodgrains. The target is set to sell 53,500 metric tones of foodgrains in the frist year and 62,100 metric ton in the final year of the plan on the basis of increasing population and deficit in the hilly districts. This sale will be from minimum of 15% to 20% in the high hills and in the Hilly Regon from 20% in the firs year will be reduced to 15% in the final year with hope of increasing foodgrain production. 1. Foodgrain marketing Distribution of foodgrain will be done through institutional channels in the searce remote hilly and high hill districts. Districts having transport in the scarce remote hilly and high hill districts. Districts having transport facilities institutional distribution will be reduced. In established areas foodgrain distribution will be undertaken by private sector. The existing practice of institutional distribution in the established areas will be gradually reduced and stopped at the end of the Seventh Plan. 2. foodgrain procurement Foodgrain will be procured from the production areas emphasised by the agriculture programme for further distribution for which cooperative organisations will be given preference and private sector will be taken into confidence in purchasing the foodgrains from haat bazar or depots at a price not less than the approved price. Thus paddy, wheat, maize, millet cumulatively weighing 62,000 metric tons of consumable quantity will be procured within the plan period. For running and emergency stock 30,000 metric tons will be procured in the first year and every year stock will be renewed by corresponding new purchases. Maximum quantity will be procured from the Hilly Region for easy transport to the high hills for supply in the scarce period. This way if local market is developed transport subsidy is reduced. 3. foodgrain Stock Stock of foodgranis will be maintaned in order not to stop the flow of foodgrain to deficit area and ensure immediate supplies during emergency and to control and maintain the price.Such stocks will be used in a complementary manner. Considering the time required to transport the minimum running stock and the remoteness, a stock of 22,000 metric tons will bemaintained on the basis of 4 month stock need in the high hills and 3 months stock need in mid hills. for meeting unforeseen situation at times caused by landslides, floods, droughts, etc. stocks will be maintained in such selected locations wherfrom rush supplies can be made for estimated 200,000 persons for a period of 3 months, aking a total of 8,000 metric tons and in the established areas, 18,000 metric tons. These stock will help arrest artificial price rise if it dies take place. It will be made compulsory for the private stockholders to submit the information on foodgrain stock every 2 moths for keeping upto date information on foodgrains in connection with the study of foodgrain management and market. When renewing the loan against mortagege of foodgrains prior approval from His majesty\\'s Government which implements supply programme is essential . 4. Pricing Foodgrain will be procured at eh approved price fixed according to agriculture price and marketing programme. marketing will be under taken by fixing the price on commertcial basis. But in case price has to be reduced or common facilities like transport has to be considered His Majesty\\'s Government will bear such differential costs. 5. Storage Procurement of foodgrains, marketing, mobilisation, stock, godown for emergency and price stabilisation stock existing godowns will be utilised to their full capacity and new godowns will be constructed at appropriate places. The esisting capacity of the godowns is 87,000 metric tons which will be raised to 172,000 metric tons by adding godowns capacity for 85,000 metric tons in the Seventh Plan The target of foodgrain distribution for the programmes referred above is presented in the Table 24.69 11. Agriculture Statistics and Economic Analysis For formulating policy for agriculture development and agriculture programme agriculture statistics is very essential. Similary for studying the cost of production of other crops basic information will be collected and analysis prepared for developing policy bases economic analysis is important. To make the agriculture statistics reliable and correct and for making it impartial and independent unit should be established. For production areas which are accorded priority by the agriculture programme collection of statistics will be done separetely and published accordingly. To implement the study programme of farming expenses effectively by studying the cost of production of the crops in the area which are accorded priority by agriculture farm and agriculture programme, bases will be developed for making the investment required for agriculture programmes by identifying the unit cost of factor such as irrigation water, improved seeds, chemical fertilizer and insecticides, agriculture loan, and technical services which have important role for agriculture production. Similar studies will be carried out on livestock, fruits and vegetable farming. Such studies will be carried out after securing approval from agriculture development coordination committee, Ministry of Agriculture with a person taking full responsibility for such studies. 11. Plan Evaluation, Monitoring and Encouragement Measures. No matter how effectively the plan is prepared if the implementation is not carried out in a correct way and in time, achievement will not only lag behind the target but the overruns will necessitate additional investment of fulfil the same target and this failure to fulfil the target will adversely affect national product and the overall economy. To fill in the gap between the plan and implementaion of the previous plans with regard to development programmes, effective implementation, follow-up and review and evaluation are a must. Ecrn thourtyh the project or programme is attractive but if the implementation is not carried out correctly, the plan becomes meaningless and so for correct implementation in the Seventh Plan constant monitoring will be carried out from the stage of plan formulation to execution of all activities and to establish the practic of review and evaluation of projects and programme will be implemented clearly in the following manner: - Objective of the programme \\t: What to do, why to do, for what purpose it is to be done ? C. Detailed work plan \\tWhere, When, How Who, How much to do ? D. Constant monitoring and evaluation \\tWhat happened, How much completed, How the work was done and Where? what sort of influence it had? With regard to question related to A,B,C the Seventh Plan has been formulated with due consideration to these questions. Where, when, who How much are valid every year and so will be taken note of, while proparing the annual programmes. Constant monitoring, evaluation and review will be an insparable part of the project and programme. Such monitooring, review and evaluation will be applicable from project level to national level. Some portion of investment allotted for the project will set asid for this programme from the projcet level to ministry level of agriculture programme. This programme will be implemented in consultation with the National Planning Commission. Thus district production group of service centre level and zonal agriculture publicity office of district level will carry out the monitoring and evaluation. At the central level, division (on related subject) in the department or ministry will carry out the monitoring and evaluation. At the national level National Palnning Commission will conduct the monitoring and evaluation in consultaion with the concerned ministry. On the basis of success or failure exhibited by monitoring and evaluation of programmes, practice of reward and punishment of the responsible person(s) need to be effectively implemented. This practice will be strictly followed in the Seventh Plan, in the following manner:- 1. In each district under the supervision to the proposed agriculture production team through the service Centre, competition of crops, livestock, fish etc. will be organised and efficient farmers will be rewarded. Agriculture workers will be rewarded Rs 200.00 for attaining the target. Appropriate reward will be given to the JT/JTA who attain their respective targets. 2. If the set target of the district is fulfilled, district panchayat will be specifically honoured or additional subsidy will be given to this panchayat. If the district production team fulfils the production target medal, or training in a foreign country, or appropriate reward will be given, similarly, at the zonal level fulfillment of the zonal production target and at the ministerial level fulfillment of the national production target will be appropriately rewarded. 3. Execution of programme and fulfilling the target is possible through joint efforts and, if necessary support is not forthcoming from the respective units or institutions, fitting punishment will be given. 4. To implement the system of reward and punishment, the production target of each service center and production block has to be fixed. This should be done every year on the basis of directives received by the district agriculture coordination committee. 5. To attain the production target of the district, joint participantion of farmers, local panchayats, and agriculture workers will be encouraged, and from the stage of formulation of plan to monitoring, review and evaluation local panchayat will be associated. Budget implements, agri-lime, small irrigation seed technique service, soil analyses service, crop protection service. District level programmes to be implemented during the Seventh Plan Since agriculture development programme seeks to enlist massive participation of farmers, all production targets according to decerntralisation are included under district level programme. As mentioned in the sub-heading above on order to attain the target of agriculture production programme all feasible production are have to be brought to use. For attaining such production target production group should mobilize inputs and services like agriculture extension, agriculture credit, improved seed, fingerling, chemical fertilisers, improved livestock, veterinery service, production e3quipment, etc. through service centers in the area which are accorded priority by the programme. District production teams will be established consisting of representative of all institutions concerned with agriculture development and these teams will have to coordinate with the district agriculture coordination committee for implementing agriculture programme Therefore, to fulfil the agriculture production target fixed by the Seventh Plan, areas will be specified in the districts and programme will be implemented accordingly, District production teams will prepare the programme, get it approved from the district, implement it and will undertake follow up and evaluation. This budget is included in the overall budget presented above. Chapter 25 IRRIGATION METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY Introduction Predominance of agricultural sector can contribute highly significant role to increase national output of the country. In the seventh plan the prime importance of priority has been given to the agricultural sector to fulfill the target of an intensive production at high rate. In this respect there are abundant possibilities to have the intention of accentuation the agricultural production. Agricultural productions are estimated to increase abundantly at highly rate if irrigation facilities are fulfilled, although endowed and enriched with water resources we are still unable to utilize appropriate irrigation facilities systematically because of manifold reasons. 13 percent of irrigation facilities had been fulfilled in the agricultural land by the end of the sixth plan. Because of insufficient irrigation facilities, agriculture should wholly depend upon uncertain monsoon, no doubt. The achievement of the progress is highly low as compared to its targets because of lack of financial resources and scarcity of effective achievements in the working capacity. In order to extend and increase the agricultural output in the terai region to fulfill the necessary foodstuffs in the mountain regions to extend exports to collect foreign exchanges to build mountain regions as a self sufficiency for the foodstuffs and to make sound economic condition to the country at the same time the provisions of irrigation should be facilitated to the agriculture enormously as prime media during the seventh plan. Hence considering the past experiences at the outset the high priority should be given to the achievements of the progress as compared with the main targets on the one hand and an additional irrigational facilities should be attained to the cultivable land involving with the proper utilisation of available water resources on the another hand. Progress Evaluation of the Sixth plan During the Fifth plan period the provisions of irrigation facilities for 1,98,481 hectares of land were assumed to be fulfilled. Of this 1,80,926 and 17,555 hectares of land were provided with irrigation facilities in the Terai and Mountain regions respectively. The main target of the Sixth plan was to provide an additional irrigational facilities to 2,33,482 hectares of land but an area of 18,000 hectares could not operate under construction because of the lack of financial resources and some projects in agreement with foreign aid only by name but not in action. Some other working efficiency of irrigational projects become unable to initiate in time and could not meet the target because of manifold resons. By this way during the sixth plan period an additional 52,503 hectares of land were provided irrigational facilities for the first four years and an additionl 41,630 hectares of land were porvided for the Fifth year. Futhermore 17137 hectares of land were provided an irrigational facilities for the first four years which had been completed by agriculture Ministry with the digging tube well boring projects and an additional 3,572 hectares of land were provided an irrigational facilities by Panchayat and locl Development Ministry at the same time and at the end of the Sixth Plan 24,457 and 8,32 hectares of land were estimated to provide an additional irrigational facilities respectively. Hence the grand total of 73,212 hectares of land had been provided an additional irrigational facilities for the first four year of the sixth plan and 66,979 hectares of land were estimated in the fifth year. During the sixth plan the grand total 1,40,191 hectares of land were provided with irrigational facilities by the end of the sixth plan. There are envisaged some basic initiatives to be launched in the summer crop season drawn up to extend irrigational facilities to most of the farm lands that are irrigable to keep up the working efficiency of irrigation projects not only those initiatives but special attention will be given to proper maintenance and repair to use the full capacities of irrigation in operation to improve present, arrangement and distribution system of the irrigation, facilities construction canals to agrarian lands to give appropriate methods to utilizing, irrigational facilities to the consumed farmers to coordinate the water distribution among farmers and to pay head the social and economic conditions of the agriculturists so the available potential capacity of the irrigational facilities will be extended by only 42 percent in a planned and systematic way. Problems and constraints During the Sixth plan periodic Implementation During the Sixth plan. There were several problems and constraints which had hindered the progress of projects under construction Some of the major bottlenecks are listed below. 1. Several irrigation projects could not progress to fulfil the target because of financial problems as late release of funds by His Majesty\\'s Government . Funds release for projects are often far less than the requested amount leading to two or three years delay in scheduled project work due to financial stringency which make constraints to its constructive works. 2. Because of the lack of foreign assistance some projects which were initiated under foreign and had to work on limited budget with long duration. 3. Absence of uniformity in analysing of working rates done by different sectors the basis of contract is on the least rate because of this the contractors are unable to work out qualitatively or loose the contract in the middle or delay if the new contract is called it takes long time. From this while under construction it makes delay in working efficiency and it takes long time for completion. 5. At the outset because of lack of geological survey in the hilly areas projects are stopped due to geographical extremities in the middle while under operation it leads to the extension of time. Recommendations for the Constraints of the Sixth plan There are some major conscious recommendations and reforms of the problems of the Sixth plan which are enlisted below for the implementation of the seventh plan. 1. To keep in operation of the target of the projects if the financial resources are already allocated. 2. To specify the rate analysis of the operation of the on-going projects and implement them indifferent sectors. 3. To prepare and ensure the basic norms by specifying the feasibility studies of the projects and implement them. Objectives policies and programmes of the seventh plan Backgrounds Irrigational development is indispensable for the agricultural development. Because of these agriculture sector still depends on uncertain monsoon while paying specific attention to this situat ion if the target of the Seventh plan should be estimated which is to be practically completed then only the appropriate plans and programmes will be implemented to enhance the fulfillment of abundant agricultural production. Food deficit problems in hilly areas can not be solved immediately though the foods are transported from the terai to hilly areas. In the mountain regions special programmes will be put into effect to step up the production and productivity of food crops and the on-going projects should be completed and special attention should be given to enhance appropriate plans for the renovation and reforms of the irrigational systems. Irrigations development should provide the encouragement of the private sector for the development of the country utilising the private canals at the maximum rate. The utilisation of the irrigation facilities can contribute the significant increases in the agricultural productivity scientifically consisting of agricultural inputs and pesticides. It enhances to increase abundant agricultural production per hectares at higher rate. From these viewpoints irrigation projects to be launched in the terai will be completed as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary delay in selecting agricultural development programme to implement new projects in the endowment of water resources place to the canals handled by the farmers to assist short term irrigation projects and to emphasis the ground water irrigation projects wherein the surface projects cannot initiate the achievement. 1. As irrigation plays the vital role in extensive agriculture the certainty and permanency should be given to the uncertain agriculture which depends only on monsoon (rainfall) and then only the target of the agricultural production will be fulfilled by using the surfacial and ground water resources in the from of Natural ones. 2. To emphasis the mobilisation of Hill Irrigation Projects in order to fulfil the self sufficiency of foodstuffs increasing paramount food production in hilly areas as far as practicable. 3. To use the abundant water resources of the country in the form of the development of hydro-electricity, irrigation and drinking water purposes by using specific data and researches relating to Meteorology and Hydrology. Policies: 1. There should be the provision of enormous irrigation facilities in the major part of the agricultural land aiming to finish within a short duration and implementing the irrigational programme at low cost. 2. Stress will be given to increase the working efficiency by utilising the capacity of on-going irrigation projects and present water distribution system and develop the reforms in the management of the project in a systematic way. 3. Stress will be given to prepare the scheduled routine to bring into action on the implementation of the on-going irrigation projects. 5. Reservoirs irrigation projects will be constructed on the large scale to collect the water during the monsoon and make it available in dry seasons. Priority During the Seventh Plan, emphasis wil be given to enact the irrigational development programmes by establishing priority of new sehemes of new sehemes of surface water irrigational programmes in the possible areas, such selected priorities in operation are stated as following. 1. On-Going projects. Target of the Seventh Plan The target set for the Seventh Plan in considered as a realistic target aiming the working efficiency of the plan execution and previous experience. Additional irrigational facilities will be provided to an area of 2,35,493 hectares during the Seventh Plan period. of this 1,35,493 hectares of land will be accounted by Ministry of Water Resources and an reea of 1,00,000 hectares (50,000 hectares tube wells and 50,000 hectares small irrigation) by Ministry of Agriculture. Out of 1,35,493 hectares of land of the irrigational facilities accounted by Ministry of Water Resources, 1,06,003 hectares of land are amenable to identification for different on-going projects and 29,490 hectares of land respectively. The description of an additional irrigation facilities and sectorwise division targets drawn up by Ministry of Water Resources can be state as following. If all of these targets are attained, the net increment in the irrigated area will be 5,74,165 hectares of land, that means, the arable land will be irrigated by nearly 21.7 percent. Irrigation Development programme in the Seventh Plan A. \\tOn-going Surface Irrigation Projects (1) \\tBegmati Irrigation Project This project is expected to eventually command 68,000 hectares utilising a barrage in bagmati river between janakpur and Narayani zone within Sarlahi, Rautahat and Bara districts to increase output enormously.

C. \\tGround-Water Irrigation Project (1) Bhairawa -Lumbini Ground-Water Development Project: Second Phase This project had completed the objective of irrigating the commanding a gross area of 7,5000 hectares implementing the ground water development and conjecture use of deep wells in Rupendehi district of Bhairawa Lumbini consisting of the first phase of the net area of 4,500 hectares during the Fifth Plan period and an area of 3,000 hectares by the end of the Sixth Plan. The second phase had been initiated during 1,800 hectares aiming the irritagational facilities extensions. This project will irrigate continuously by the fiscal year 1986/87 and complete in the fiscal year 1988/89. (2) Shallow Tube Well Project This Project has been initiated for digging tube well development by the government involving the work of boring only but the individual farmer should take loans from agricultural Development Bank or from other institutions or do by themselves for shallow tube wells equipped with a pump, drainage net works and other pump expenses including with reconstru ction and repairing at the same time. During the Seventh Plan the project will extend additional irrigational facilities to an area of 10,000 hectares only. This project was initiated in 1983.84 aiming to irrigate especially in Kapilbastu and Mahottari district wherein the surface water is lacked in those districts establishing a ground -water development within a pump and diesel engine, investigating finding out the storage of the ground-water, studying feasibility of the project and utilising the successful tube wells at the same time. This project has the target to irrigate an area 1,200 hectares during the Seventh Plan. This project will be completed in the fical year 1989/90. (4) \\tKailali Kanchanpur Tube -Well Irrigation Project This project was initiated in the fiscal year 1980/81 for tube well construction of Kailali and Kanchanpur district to increase agricultural production extensively. The project had extended the irrigational facilities of an area of 2,315 hectares during the Sixth Plan. By the Seventh Plan an additional area of 3,350 hectares will be estimated to irrigate. The irrigational facilities were provided from the fiscal year 1985/86. (5) \\tGroundwater Water Investigation This project was initiated in the fiscal year 1984/85 investigating ground-water storage into productive tube well construction.

This project will complete in the fiscal year 1986/87. E. \\tFeasibility Studies and Implementation of Feasible Project In the Seventh Plan, like the prior plans, different feasible projects has been estimated to irrigate intensively to agricultural production and utilising maximum amount of water resources into the provisions of irrigation facilities of Nepalese Kingdom. This project during the Sixth Plan has studied the preparation of 20 preliminary projects, detail survey of an area of 52,000 hectares. In addition, This project will complete the feasibility of preliminary study and detail survey of an area of 19,000 hectares under the short term irrigation programme of feasibility study. During the Seventh Plan this project will study 16 preliminary feasible studi9es including with Sunkosi Diversion Project and detail survey of an area of 40,000 hectares of long term irrigation project and 600 preliminary study projects of the short term irrigation programme emphasizing the priority to the scarcity of foodstuff areas of all developmental sectors and detail survey of an area of 30,000 hectares. Consideringf the experiences of the Sixth Plan extensive attention will be given during the Seventh Plan to complete the incompleted projects of the4 Sixth Plan and to initiate new programmes. During the Seventh Plan this project will implement feasible projects of different projects on the basis of feasibility study extending and additional irrigation facilities of an area of 8,000 hectares in the terai region. F. \\tOthe rProgrammes (1) \\tCommand Area Development Project This project had been initiated since 1982/83 extending the irrigation facilities in a scientific manner and maximum un=tilisation of water resources in terms of irrigational development increasing production intersively and reforms in the management of the irrigational development projects of Sarlahi District of Janakpur Zone, Nawalparasi and Kapilbastu district of Lumbini zone consisting of Banganga, West Gandak canal and Manusmara irrigation projects. This project will complete in the fiscal year a1987/88. This project will expand the irrigation facilities of boost production scientifically after completion. (2) \\tRiver Control This programme during the Seventh Plan constructing t6he barrage to control and prevent the danger created by extensive river flood to the arable and. This project will enhance the implementation of the programme of river control wherein it was severely indispensable emphasizing the local participation. In each and every developmental zones, river control programme will be implemented as a special project. (3) \\tSupervision, Maintenance and Reconstruction of Completed projects This programme has been initiated to extend intensive production and to utilise maximum resources by supervising the maintenance and reconstruction of the completed projects continuously. This programme will continue in the Seventh Plan and will handover to the local panchayat through the working consumption committee to increase efficiency of technicians in the district level. (4) \\tMeteorology This project was initiated in 1965 for the specific and authentic data of Meteorology and forecasting services to the farmers in a scientific manner. During the Seventh Plan this continuous programme will enhance to establish 5 Weather controlling centres, establishment of 20 Climatologist, 5 Aerosynauptid centres, establishment of 2 pilot balloon centres, and publishment of weekly bulletins of climatologically records of (5) \\tHydrology Thios project had been initiated since 1962 to collect data and detail surveys of Rivers and Water Resources Development Consisting of different projects. This programme during the Seventh Plan has the main target to establish 350 water conditions controlling reconstruction centres 60 water condition centres, construction of 15 tar ways, construction of 12 record stations, 14 Thergrene model collection centres and workshop of Hydrology at the same time. G. \\tDistrict Level Programmes under Decentralisation Plan During the Seventh Plan, Special emphasis will be given to implement the district level programmes under decfentralisation plan on irrigation sector, the district level programme will consist of those project which will affect or cover the only one district and should not be handled by development committees. Special attention will be given to mass local participation for the implementation of handling the selection of working programmes on district level. At the outset, under the district level plan this type of programme may enhance to complete on going projects, to specify the project handled by the local services and to initiate new projects with low cost in order to irrigate enormously of an area of 15,000 hectares in the terai region, and 45,000 hectares in the mountain regions respectively. Special efforts should arrange to irrigate enormously at low cost investment on projects. The proper management of irrigation should be indispensable for utilisation, supervision, maintenance and reconstruction of the completed projects. After completion of the project, the benefits will directly be available to local panchaysts and the provisions for supervision, control, r4econstruction and maintenance of the projects should be made by local panchayat itself. This type of programme will create the local participation to express the encouragement of the mental sensitive for the conservation of the project. Therefore, during the plan period the responsibility of the project consisting of mobilisation, maintenance and reconstruction should be entrusted to local panchayats, the technical services for the maintenance and reconstruction of the project will be provided y the central level. The sistrict level projects on irrigational development, during the Seventh Plan, costs at Rs 587.5 million in the different districts and the projects of central level are transferred to the district level in accordance with the decentaralised plan and attention should be given to emphasis on the district programmes implementing annual plans. Estimations of Expenses Irrigational programmes, during the Seventh Plan are estimated to have the allocation of expenses at the cost of Rs 3296.3 million for irrigation facilities and Rs 52.3 million for Hydrology and Meteorology. The estimation of capabilities of allocation of expenses of and additional irrigational facilities can e presented as following. Chapter 26 LAND REFORM, COOPERATIVE AND SURVEY PROGRAMME Land Reform Land reform programme has its own importance in institutional development for increasing agriculture production. It is necessary to move ahead with the land reform programme in the Seventh Plan in order to develop atmosphere for bringing maximum increase in production by effecting appropriate improvements in land ownership and utilization pattern. Progress of the Sixth Plan There has been no progress in fulfilling the target of organisation system and reorganisation of the manpower under the land reform department for the implementation of land reform programme as a special programme in the areas where the integrated agriculture programme is under implementation. Under the regular activities tenancy right is being protected, determination of land tax has been completed in twelve districts in the first four years of the Sixth plan, land tax has been fixed in the whole of the terai region and necessary legal arrangements have been completed for scrutinising the land beyond the exemption limit. The main problem is the delay in preparing the legal basis for carrying out the targeted works inland reform effectively. Background of Seventh Plan While scrutinising the experience of the past years it becomes clear that the programme has been emphasising on protecting tenancy rights, preparing the list of tenants, rent fixation, terminating the dual ownership, selling the excess land above ceilings. But it has not been possible to increase the agricultural production nor agriculture business has taken the commercial from in spite of those programmes. The number of tenants is small as compared to the large number of land owners but there has been no progress in making institutional arrangements for making maximum utilization of their land. If it is necessary to accelerate the practice of deciding on protecting the existing and would-be tenants, determining the land tax for them, introducting the system of the tenants getting loan against their tenancy certificate, securing the loan by auctioning those certificates in case of their default, determining the excess land, making gradual termination of dual-ownership of land effective and to get rid of the legal obstacles on the one hand, it has been found extremely necessary to take steps in creating suitable atmosphere for investment on commercial farming for encouraging majority of the land owners for maximum use of their land. Necessary steps will b e taken to provide facilities for encouraging such farming by introducing the system of encouraging the land owners to give the land on contract or on rent and by controlling the fragmentation of additional land, developing the land in blocks, encouraging the individuals or firms to cultivate commercially. Objective: 1. To update the list of tenants for protecting their tenancy rights. 2. To support land development and production increase by expanding rent fixation system. 3. To make arrangements for terminating the dual ownership of land. 4. \\tto acquire the land in excess of ceilings for sales and distribution. 5. To encourage the activities of fixation of block and land development by controlling sub-division and fragmentation of land which are the constraints to increasing agriculture production. 6. To encourage farming contract and promissory for commercializing the agriculture business. Policy 1. Implement programmes to eliminate obstacles effectively which come in the way of keeping t he list of tenants intact and protect the tenancy rights. 2. To increase the importance of tenancy right necessary systems will be introduced for giving the institutional agriculture loan against the mortgage of tenancy certificates. 3. The system of determine land tax will be executed effectively and productivity will be as the basis of land tax determination: 1. Complete the work of keeping the list of the missing old tenants and the new tenants up-to date in 21 districts of the terai where the number of tenants is more, 4 districts of the inner-terai and in the hilly districts where the survey is complete. 2. With the intention of giving a major share of the produce of the land to the tiller and increasing their investment for increasing production rent fixation will be completed by surveying the hilly districts by giving them priority where the number of tillers appear to be large in addition to the 27 districts where rent is determined according to the fixed rent policy. In the districts where rent is determined, studies will be conducted to find out rent effectiveness. Similarly, surveys will be conducted about the process of capital investment in the appropriate land units and land with and without tenancy rights; bases for institutional development will be created for increasing the agriculture production. 3. In this context that while observing the pattern of investment for agriculture production is not effective the policy will be to encourage the agriculture system of farming on contract and promissory basis in the Seventh Plan for increasing the production by proper use of agriculture land in spite of the fact that the composition of land-ownership is more than two -thirds tillers are land owners as well. Arrangements will be made that land owners will be allowed to give the land on contract or on rent for a specific period for commercial farming. Encouragement will be given to those who will cultivate on contract for a specific period by exempting the income tax. Such contracts can be entered into by organisation or individuals. 4. All over due loans will be realised completely within the Seventh Plan and amounts thus collected will be handed over to cooperative organisations through agriculture Development Bank. 5. Atmosphere will be created to associate farmers in maximum number for increasing production by enabling them to take loan against the tenancy certificate when they have to take loan for various inputs for participating in the agriculture production programme. 6. The proposed leg al base for terminating the dual-ownership of land gradually will be experimented in certain regions. 7. If the farmers who are willing to develop land by making blocks have no money for exchanging suitable land or procure land, finance will be made available to them from agricultural development Bank or other institutions for effecting the system of making blocks and, for the consolidation of land, works related to this will be started and registration fee will be exempted for exchange of land. B. Comparatives Development Cooperatives development programme becomes important for bringing improvement in the economic condition of the people by associating them in the development activities through the medium of cooperatives and by gathering together the scattered manpower and small capital. It is very essential to carry forward the cooperative programme in order to make it effective from the bottom level in the Seventh Plan. Progress of the Sixth Plan Reorganise the cooperative organisations by conducting feasibility studies for improving the qualitative condition of the existing cooperative organisations under comparing programme and consolidation programme small farmer cooperative organisation under integrated progarmme for development of cooperatives. 32 small farmers cooperatives and 37 cooperative organisations were established. The members of the cooperative organisations at the end of the Fifth Plan which was, 1,193,765 went up to 1,399,121 at the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan. Rs 38,300,000 worthy of agriculture produce is expected to be sold in the Sixth Plan period. Expected progress has not ben possible while scrutinising capacity of the cooperative organisations in playing important role in the rural areas and in improving the rural economics for agriculture development. Weakness in the management of cooperative organisation, problem of operating capital because of ineffective realisation of capital effecting the capital flow, influential members taking benefits from the cooperative movement, small and less influential members unable to take advantages are the major problems. Background of Seventh Plan Appropriate atmosphere will be created for strengthening cooperatives at the rural level, for support to increase the welfare and facilities of cooperative organisations, manage the central office of the cooperative organisations and it has been essential to offer membership to the farmer group of small farmer development projects and other areas in order to develop them in the form of pre-cooperatives. Objectives 1. To look after the welfare of the small and marginal farmers through the medium of cooperatives by organising them. 2. Necessary basic facilities required for agriculture development will be made available in an organised manner on the basis of local leadership and people\\'s participation. 3. Develop institutional channels at the rural levels with the aim of providing direct benefit to the small farmers and other professional in addition to increasing their production and productivity. Policies: It is necessary do develop the havit of making the cooperative organisation work in the institutional from within the conception of cooperative movement from the bottom level. Against this background for the institutional development of the cooperative movement various classes such as farmers, small farmers, labourers craftsman, skilled hands gather together in their leisure with a specific objective that their cooperation can create opportunities for increasing earnings and employment and programmes should be implemented in creating a feeling among them to this effect. Hence, for strengthening the cooperative programme from the bottom level the following programme will be implemented:- a. Strengthening Cooperative organisations i) \\tWhile establishing cooperative organisations nine areas in a district will be considered and programme will be given priority on the basis of feasibility studies in the districts where there is no cooperatives. Rules and bi-laws will be formulated for people\\'s participation and increasing people\\'s leadership for running the cooperative organisations. ii) \\tThe existing cooperative organisations in the rural areas will be strengthened by on reorganization and consolidation for their operation for providing services along with the services centres in special and pocket regions where agriculture programme is emphasised. iii) \\tPublicity and promotion programme will be implemented for increasing membership of the cooperative organisations. Membership of self-made members, because of handing over of savings, will be saleable. iv) \\tIn the districts where small farmers development projects are implemented, once completed, these will be converted into cooperative organisations or necessary service oriented programmes will be implemented by giving membership to the existing cooperative groups. Legal provisions will be made in case of offering the membership of the cooperative organisations to the small farmer groups when necessary. v) \\tIn the areas where small farmers development project has no influence, small and marginal farmers groups will be guided to organise themselves for the economic activities for creating earning and employment opportunities by giving them loans. Not only small farmers but other farmers also will be organised into such groups, Pre-cooperative group (s) into cooperative organisations by encouraging them to be engaged in economic activities. vi) \\tTo solve the problem of shortage of operating capital effective steps will be taken to develop legal bases to have automatic loan realisation. i) \\tArrangement will be made to make available rural saving banking services through cooperatives with the coordination of the Nepal Rastra Bank in encouraging the rural people to develop the habit of saving and in investing capital, generated out of the savings mobilisation, in the productive activities in the feasible regions. ii) \\tDifferent processing programmes will be implemented by establishing specialised cooperative organisations on the basis of feasibility for rice milling, oil mills, milk collection and processing, cardamom processing, ginger processing, etc. for encouraging organisations will be associated with foodgrain processing and oil mills, five cooperative organisations will be established for milk collection and processing and two each for cardamom and ginger processing. iii) \\tActivities will be carried out for farmers residing in the rural areas and other skilled craftsmen running cottage and small scale industries in their leisure time from farming through cooperatives in the form of one existing cooperative organisations or separate six women cottage industries cooperative programme on the basis of feasibility or by establishing and association. Necessary coordination will be maintained for management, supply of raw materials and marketing of produced goods in consolation with the Women\\'s Service Coordination committee. c. \\tCooperative Education and Training Training programme will be conducted for development of skilled and trained manpower for implementing cooperative programmes, for increasing awareness amo ng cooperative members on the concepts of cooperative movement, for developing the feeling that cooperative organisations will be established according to the needs of the people and they themselves will run the cooperatives for their own benefit. A federation of cooperative organisations of the country will be established at the national level for coordinating them, providing them leadership, for executing the cooperative programmes by strengthening them from the central level. For the service facilities to be provided to the districts by the cooperative organisation according to the decentralisation policy primarily district cooperative organisation and district cooperative office will be associated with the proposed district level group for supervision, follow-up and monitoring agriculture programme. It has been necessary to carry out various activities such as measuring the land in a scientific manner, finding out the exact area of land, supporting the determination of survey policy and its implementation, preparing maps in different scales within the country for different purposes and producing necessary manpower for survey programmes effectively in the Seventh Plan. Progress of the Sixth Plan With regards to survey programme specifically in the Plan, survey of nine districts was in progress, that of 5 districts completed and 504,160 hectares wer4e demarcated against the target of continuing survey works in 16 districts, to complete surveys in 12 districts and demarcate 515,260 hectares. The main reason for the survey to continue and to be completed in small number of districts is that the actual area is more than the estimated area in some districts. Against the target of inking 37,500 data cards and establishing 37,500 ting points only 34,099 and 35,557 respectively were accomplished. Against the target of preparing 970 sheet6s of maps in different scales 1,048 sheets of maps were prepared. Against the t6arget of training 951 trainees 55I trainees were trained. Since all the trainees have not been employed the number had to be reduced. Background of Seventh Plan It is extremely necessary to complete survey of all the districts of the country for correct statistics on land re4quired for different development programmes in steering the activities to wares a definite direction. In this context the objective of the survey programme in the Seventh Plan is presented below. Objectives 1. Emphasis will be given to complete the survey programme for determining the correct area of land and other statistics. 2. To prepare maps of different scales required for implementing administrative, social and economic development projects. 3. To establish control points and bench marks required for all types of survey works scientifically. 4. To be self -sufficient in manpower required for preparing different types of maps within the country. Policey Programme: Survey programmes which will be implemented in the Seventh Plan are given below: - a. \\tDemarcation Survey During the seventh plan survey of 65 districts of the country will be completed for preparing the maps according to demarcated plots by measuring the land units of each land owner or tiller under the project and the correct list of plots will be prepared for assisting the decision making units of land disputes, land tax and land. In addition to this, special programme will be implemented to survey the urban areas and rural blocks. Emphasis will be given to improve and update the old survey maps prepared in FY 1965/66 on plot demarcation and micro films of the maps, ownership certificates, etc. will be preserved. The targets set for the plot demarcation survey and programmes are given below: Topographic survey has an important role to play in the preparation of maps of different scales and in attaining self sufficiency in map preparation required for different development projects and administrative works. In the Seventh Plan programmes will be implemented to prepare 125 sheets of medium scale maps, 101 sheets of small scale maps (maps for administrative, tourism and other activities), to prepare atlas, update 50 sheets of topographic maps of hilly region in scale of 1 inch equal to 1 mile, to survey 150,000 hectares for preparing large scale topographic map, to prepare 160 sheets of land resources map and to update them, to prepare school atlas, etc. 4. Survey Training The target is to attain self-sufficiency by producing technicians for survey in the country within the Seventh Plan. In this period, the target is to train 125 Amins, 250 junior trainees, 75 senior trainees, 30 persons in cartographic course, 25 persons in special photogramatic course, 20 persons in special map reproduction and 40 persons in computer course. In addition to this project will be prepared for diploma level course on cadestral survey. Budget CHAPTER 27 , VEGETATION, LAND PROTECTION AND WILD-LIFE PRESERVATION AND REHABILITATION , being one of the most important national resources, has been supplying fuel, timber, fodder for animals, etc. is a well-known fact. But, since last few years this resource has been dwindling very fast. As a result essential goods like fuel, timber, etc, are not meeting the needs of the growing population. In the previous plans afforestation was very low as compared to deforestation and the pace of dwindling of forest appears to be such that in the next two decades there will be no forest left worth mentioning. Imple mentation of forest development programme is a big challenge for supplying the essential goods like fuel, timber, etc. and to maintain the natural balance. It has been imperative to increase the forest area by large-scale afforestation in addition to preservation, promotion and use of the existing forests through the scientific management of forest as a renewable resource. The situation calls for motivating the general public to take part in afforestation in a big way since an important activity like afforestation cannot be undertaken only at the government level. Progress of the Sixth Plan By giving top most importance to meeting the internal need of the forest products for the general public, topmost priority will be given to supply the required forest products. Fertility of the soil in the Hilly Region in particular will be protected by adopting ways and means to stop the natural calamities like landslide, floods, land- erosion and stop the rivers and rivulets from drying up and economic advantages derived by exporting - the herbs in semi -processed forms. These were the objectives of the Sixth Plan. The estimate is that in the Sixth Plan 11,680,000 saplings were planted in 37,000 hectares and 14,713 kill of forest fencing completed under forest development programme. Thus the progress of afforestation and forest fencing are 87% and 77% of the physical target respectively. Towards distribution of saplings the progress exceeded the physical target. The reason for excessive distribution of sapling is that progress of the special economic programme of FY 1982/83 has been included. Though the progress is 87 % in average in afforestation programme it could not fulfil 23 % of the set target in the panchayat forest. In totality though the progress against the target appear to be satisfying or encouraging but against the prevailing problems the progress has to be considered normal. For programmes were not formulated and implemented in accordance with the need and the gap between the demand and supply was wider and wider. With regard to land and watershed protection it is estimated that 167gullies were controlled and 280 hectares of terraces were improved. But, against the target set in the plan the programme itself was too small to tackle the prevailing problem of the country though the progress appears too attractive and hence there is no room for complacency because land erosion and situational problems have been ever magnifying. Towards botanical development the target was fixed to use different herbs according to the demand of time and to carry out scientific research on herbs which have been in use profitably according to Ayurvedic methods and traditional practices and to develop technology for them. In the first four years of the Sixth Plan different research activities were carried out on botanical development but no progress was recorded as to handling over of the developed technology to the concerned units. Under medicine management and development programme to introduce scientific and institution supervision and controlling system on the activities such as production of medicines, export, import, service, research, storage and marketing and publicity and promotion not only physical, administrative, legal infrastructures, and manpower were developed but regulations related to registration of medicines were also put into effect. The progress of methodology of determining quality of medicines, and evaluation, analysis and testing .of such methodologies, and formulation of policies and rules on medicines appears satisfactory. About national parks and wild life preservation, construction and renovation of different infrastructures in he existing sanctuaries and improvement activities are completed as per the target. On top of it wild life sanctuary in Bara hunting preserve at Dhorpatan and national parks at Dolpa and Khaptad are established. Under forest products development programme, Sagarmatha Forest Development Project and Ratuwamai Affrostation Project have fulfilled the set target. With respect of rosin and turpentine industry only, preliminary works were completed against the target of completing the construction works of the factory within the plan period. Except sera and vaccines production of all necessary medicines is estimated to attain 100% of the target. But the final list of extremely essential medicines has not been made ready so far. In FY 1981/82 a company for producing and processing of herbs was established and construction works was started and production and processing works are proceeding according to the set target. Cultivable land will be cultivated for contributing to production through the channels of rehabilitation programme. People who migrate from the hilly areas to the terai and settle clearing the forests in an unorganised manner will be settled in a planned way and tendency of migration to the terai from hilly areas will be reduced and the target was fixed for rehabilitating through resettlement programme appropriately on economic considerations. Of the target of the Sixth Plan to settle 25,630 families in 30,185 hectares, 27,102 families were settled in 17,900 hectares. While preparing the Sixth Plan, the objective was set for increasing agricultural production by cultivating more land by settling more people. But as the environmental balance and preservation of the remaining are adversely affected from the settlement activities by clear felling of forests, His Majesty\\'s Government has taken the policy of not carrying out the resettlement programme by clear felling of forests. Background of the Seventh Plan Forests which was the main source of income till a few decades back has dwindled to such an extent that it has become very critical. If on the one hand it is clear that forest products required for the increasing population, cattle and industries are dropping every day not only the situational, balance has been disturbed because of destruction of ecology on the hills, mountains, river banks, farms, etc. but also spoilage of agricultural products has been quite clear. Around 1963, 64,000 sq. km. or 45 % of the total land of the country was covered with forests but in 1978 or just after 15 years it has gone down to 43,000 sq.km. or 30% of the land area. Thus in a period of 15 years forest resources has dwindled by about thirty three percent. While looking at the pace of destruction of forest in the terai and hills in the last 15 years 4,600 sq.km. of forest land in the hills has gone down to 3,900 sq.km and 1,800 sq.km. in terai to 400 sq.km. During that period forest in the hills dwindled by 15 % and in the terai by about 78 %. Even though 50 to 55 thousands sq.km. of forest area has been shown in the country according to the preliminary estimate of Land Resources Mapping Project initiated in the Sixth Plan how much forest wealth exists and how much can be utilised on the basis of management system remain questionable. Among the prominent reasons for the fast dwindling of forest, fire wood, one of the most essential commodities of the daily life, is the one single factor. As a result, it is clear that the forest is dwindling every year at a faster rate because firewood production on the sustained yield basis has not been able to meet the demand. This gap between the demand and supply is obviously the main cause of the annual forest destruction, which is estimated to be 1000 sq.km. (or more than 100,000 hectares) for firewood alone one study on the subject points out that for regular supply of firewood only in the next fifteen years 1,200000 hectares of good sal forest is necessary. To prepare a good sal forest of 1,200,000 hectare afforestation should take place in about 200,000 hectares in the Seventh Plan. In the Fifth and Sixth Plan or in a period of 1O years though it was estimated that afforestation could take place in 47,000 hectares it could not be more than 20 to 25 thousand hectare of forest for firewood production with the selection of afforestation area and introduction of scientific management system. Therefore to have 200,000 hectares of land in five years for firewood only afforestation in 175,000 hectare is a must. With the annual increase of c_tt1e, industries, domestic use, etc. the demand for forest products has been increasing every day. The way the price of firewood is increasing illustrates that supply of firewood is far too short of demand. In spite of difficulties in collecting statistics on the demand and supply of firewood it has been extremely necessary to increase the forest area for firewood production. For the supply of firewood and in order to give minimum support by the afforestation programme afforestation has to be added in 15 to 20 thousand hectares of land every year. According to the opinion of the experts, 43 % of the land area of the country should be covered by good forest in order to maintain the greenery in the country and improve the situational balance. But, in the present circumstance, more than 1 lakh (100,000) hectares of forest area has been, destroyed every year and so, if the afforestation activity cannot be undertaken as a campaign the  will be completely disappearing and desertification process will increase within the next 20 to 25 years. On the one hand the situation is very critical and if we review the efforts and achievements of the two periodic plans though top priority was given in these two plans only 47,000 hectares could be covered by afforestation. Thus in two plans or in 10 years if 47,000 hectares have been afforested on the one hand, on the other side the destruction. of the forest in one year is more than 2 times that of the afforestion in 10 years. By controlling the depleting forest on the one hand, it its necessary to maintain situational balance again, on the other it is obligatory to fulfil the daily needs of timber, firewood, grass etc. and raw materials for the industry. Otherwise the country will loose the flaura and fauna because of the situational imbalances along with the adverse effect on the economy of the hills from the loss in productivity, lack of forest products, etc. With these problems in the coming years forest products will be a sort of rare commodity. Because of increasing practice of burning cowdung cake and constant land erosion productivity in agriculture will drop miserably. To meet the immediate needs then small trees will be felled and forest products will get rarer and with the increase in land erosion every day calamities like floods, landslides will be a common sight. It is obvious that the economic problem will enlarge out of proportion. Small scale efforts would not solve this critical situation. The most serious fact is that whatever forest is left it is not possible to meet the current needs of firewood and timber without destroying the forest wealth. If afforestation is not carried out on warfooting the situation will go from bad to worse. Hence in the Seventh Plan afforestation must be done in 200,000 hectares with full determination and confidence and it is necessary to fulfil the daily necessities by preserving the forests scientifically planting trees which are fast growing and of suitable variety with the people\\'s participation. Similarly in the problem-laden locations pioneering efforts have to be put in maintaining situational balance by preserving the existing natural resources by land protection and other methods. On top of it, it is necessary to produce the basic medicines using the herbs, a part of the forest products, export the forest products in the finished and semi -finished forms; it is necessary and desirable to carry out all the activities related to forest development with labour intensive methods like increasing the employment opportunities in the rural areas, for bringing improvement in the social upliftment and economic situation of the country. Objectives On the basis of the above background the following objectives are set in the Seventh Plan. 1. To fulfil the people\\'s daily needs of forest products keeping in view of supplying major portion of the daily needs of forest products of the people like firewood, timber, grass, etc. forest development will be effected by giving top priority to the worst forest areas. 2. To maintain the situational balance To re-establish the deteriorating situational balance through different prorammes of afforestation and watershed preservation, 3. To derive maximum economic gains from the forest products To increase the economic gains by exporting herbs and other forest products available in the country. Policies of the Seventh Plan 1. By encouraging maximum participation of the people in the afforestation programme for fulfilling the needs of daily life such as timber, firewood, leaves and grass, afforestation will be carried out wildly and afforested areas protected. Target of the Seventh Plan Programme of the Seventh Plan A. \\tAfforestation Afforestation will be carried out in 175,000 hectares in the plan period in order to implement the afforestation programme widely for fulfiling the objective set by the Plan. According to the target set afforestation will be carried out in 65,000 hectares at the Government level and in 110,000 hectares through the people by motivating them. For this the following working policy will be adopted: 1. 1 \\tIn the districts where the management plan is ready high yield afforestation will take place according to the set plan by avoiding low value or unproductive forest. In the district where the management plan is not ready the district forest office will determine the unproductive forest and naked hills for carrying out afforestation every year. 1.2 \\tFirst priority will be given in afforestation in the hills and districts with precarious forests. 1 .4 \\tConsideration will be given to preservation without using barbed wire fence in afforestation. 2. For fulfilling the daily needs the approach of maintaining the forest area by re-afforestation by corporations like the T. C. N., Fuel Corporation and the Department of Forests in the areas where they have carried out felling operation. Under this approach afforestation will be carried out in 25,000 hectares with fast growing species and preserved accordingly. The following working policy will be adopted. 2. 1 \\tDistrict forest offices will provide necessary technical assistance and manpower for afforestation by the corporations for this. 2.2 \\tWith the consideration of preservation of afforestation without barbed wire fence local people will be hired for this works. Wherever fencing is necessary local materials like stones or tree branches will be used in order to increase employment opportunities and saving of foreign exchange. Afforestation through Motivation of People With the outlook of having maximum afforestation by motivating people more than by government sector direct involvement, afforestation will be carried out in 110,000 hectares of land. With the aim of providing assistance for motivating people for all afforestation works, one nursery in each area of the 9 areas of the district will be established in addition to the existing nurseries and the responsibility will be given to the local panchayats individual or service centres. To increase awareness in the minds of the people for the afforestation and preservation works and with the aim of preparing manpower for the future, by selecting one interested teacher in each of the primary or middle schools throughout the country, training will be given on afforestation and preservation. Through the selected teachers the importance of establishment of nurseries and afforestation will be explained to the students and afforestation will be started in the selected places. On top of it arousing interest on programmes like forest preservation community forest and afforestation programme publicity and promotion will be carried widely, and the teachers will have a big role in motivating the rural private sector in afforestation. The concerned teachers will not only be encouraged but attractive rewards will be given to the efficient and excellent teachers and students. The following afforestation activities will be carried through the motivation of people. 1. With the aim of making the rural people self-sufficient in timber, firewood, dried leaves, wide afforestation and preservation will be carried by handling over the government forests to the community. In addition to the preservation of the existing forests under this programme afforestation will be carried out in 65,000 hectares as Panchayat and Panchayat preserved forests. The following working policy will be adopted for this : afforestation. 1.8 \\tA contact person or group will be nominated in each panchayat where programme will be implemented and encouragement will be given for providing assistance to the panchayat or individuals for formulation and implementation of the programme in developing forests and bringing imp rovements in the environment by working in their respective domestic fields. 1.9 \\tIn such afforestation programmes 15 to 20 % will be dalegrass plantation. 2. Afforestation will be carried out in a total area of 20,000 hectares in all the five development regions of the country. The following working policy will be adopted for this : 2.1 Arrangement will be made to have afforestation by creating private forest areas at the rate of five hectares in five year period in each panchayat. respective schools for growing saplings, afforestation and developing manpower for future and encouraging participation in afforestation activity by establishing nurseries in the Panchayats where the school is located. 2.10 In such afforestation activities 25 % will be dalegrass. 3. By giving all sorts of protection for preserving afforested forest areas around the houses owned by the government and for herbal farming, 15,000 hectares will be afforested within five years in the form of contract forest at an average rate of 3.5 hectares in each panchayat. Just like the private sector afforestation programme, encoura gement will be given in making available technical and financial assistance under this programme. 4. Afforestation and preservation will be carried out by making saplings and technical advice available throughout the country for afforestation around the res idential areas, school compound, offices, etc, Under this programme for lalegrass, timber, firewood, etc. throughout the country a total of 24,000,000 saplings will be distributed for afforestation in 10,000 hectares. The following working policy will be adopted for this: 4. 1 \\tThe practice will be adopted for production of saplings adequately for the annual programme while producing spa lings for every year distribution programme of the previous year will be reviewed. 4.2 \\tSaplings will be freely distributed by the district offices and publicity and promotion will be one in the districts about this programme. 4.3 \\t office will keep a constant vigil whether saplings are planted or not and whether preservation is carried out or not every year. . 4.4 \\tArrangement will be made to reward in order of first, second and third on the basis of survival rates, when 50 or more saplings are planted by the family or school or office. 4.5 \\tBy extending agro-forestry process interest of the people will be aroused. 4.6 \\tAmong the saplings to be distributed 25 % will be dalegrass. Distribution will be made in coordination with the agriculture office. B. \\t Preservation Programme The following working policy will be adopted for the preservation and maintenance of forest: 1. Management systems will be adopted for preservation of each forest area. 2. As far as possible barbed wire fencing\\' for preservation work will be discouraged and the approach will be taken to select some individuals among the local inhabitants who have direct connection with the forest entrusted with the responsibility for its preservation. By paying wages to the preservation workers as an incentive employment opportunities will be increased and the outlook will be to maximise mobilisation of people\\'s participation. The outlook will be taken to have maximum preservation of forest through people\\'s participation. 3. District forest office will observe periodically as to whether proper preservation is done or not in the afforested area and existing forest, and adopt the practice of preservation in all ways. 4. Loss in the forest by grazing will be minimised by encouraging the people to follow stall feeding through publicity and promotion about its importance for feeding the cattle. 5. To carry out publicity and promotion about the importance of the panchayat forest, panchayat preserved forest, private forest, contract forest, government sector and disseminate the management principles in simple language and arouse awareness about the availability \\tof \\tforest \\tproducts continuously if managed accordingly. 6. To implement the necessary publicity and promotion programmes about the importance of preservation of forest by taking the outlook of mo bilisation of people\\'s participation in the preservation works. 7. It will be the programme to let the people know about the contribution on maintaining natural balance and social upliftment from the results of implementing forest preservation programme as a sample by selecting one area in the headquarter of each development region. C. \\tLand and Watershed Protection Programme Programmes like source of water, habitation farming, check dam in the watershed area on either side of the important roads, gally control, landslide control, terrace improvement, etc. will be implemented for protection keeping in view of the situation of depleting of natural flaura and fauna and dropping of agricultural productivity of the country because of destruction of ecology if land erosion is not controlled in time. By conducting studies every year on the areas where formidable forms will be taken due to land erosion, on areas identified as worst and bad watershed areas protection programmes will be implemented on countrywide basis by giving top priority. The following working policy will be adopted for implementing this programme:- 1. Under the watershed protection programmes, erosion prone areas will be given highest priority than areas where land erosion has taken abnormal proportions. 2. Countrywide protection programmes will be implemented through the local people by making them conscious and active on this instead of the government office selecting and implementing the project. From this consideration the approach will be taken to see that government institutions will function like an instrument to implement the programme through the people by making them conscious rather than the institution which implements the programme directly on its own. 3. Watershed .protection committee will be established consisting of local teacher, ex-military personnel and well-known persons for deriving direct benefits of watershed protection programme. By making arrangements for training, study tours, etc. on watershed protection to the members of the committee they will be made efficient, aware and conscious. Protection works will be carried out through these committees by providing technical services and making equipment available to them in connection with protection. 4. Attractive rewards will be given to the panchayats, committees and individuals Who prove to be excellent in land and watershed protection works. 5. One project in each of the headquarters of the development region will be established as a sample to demonstrate how economically and easily watershed protection can be carried out. 6. Education on protection, publicity and information will be imparted to the local people about the necessity of becoming austere in the use of natural resource, of carrying out scientific land use and of becoming self- sufficient in production of natural resources. D. National Parks and Wildlife Preservation Programme The programme will be to preserve, promote and manage properly the wildlife which are rare, important and in the verge of extinction, in parks established in different geographical areas and wildlife sanctuaries. Working Policy The programme will be implemented to add essential facilities normally, required for running national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and hunting sanctuaries established in the Sixth Plan. E. \\tHerbal Farming, Extension and Processing Programme The programme will be to process 1,550 metric tons of herbs by extending herbal farming to 250 hectares. The following working policy will be adopted for this : 1. Farming of herbs which are successful in the experimental farming and which can derive economic benefit will be extended at the government, non-government and commercial levels. 2. Necessary seeds, saplings and technical assistance will be provided to farmers who are willing to take up herbal farming. 3. Farmers will be provided with the know-how and techniques on farming after carrying proper research on appropriate techniques and varieties of herbs for inter-cropping with the agricultural crops in the important areas which appear different from the consideration of climate, soil and altitude. 4. Publicity and promotion of herbal farming will be expanded and people will be informed about the price and gains from herbal farming. 5. Attractive rewards will be given to the farmers who prove to be pioneers in the field of herbal farming. 6. By extending herbal farming in the existing farms they will be made self-sufficient. Studies and research activities will be carried out on plants collected from different parts of the country. The following working policy will be adopted for this : 1. To produce seeds and saplings which will be economically beneficial, techniques will be developed for conducting research on development of vegetation connected with the people\\'s life and for using them. G. Medical Research and Technique Development Programme Programmes such as research on pharmaceutical production, analysis and testing of medicines and development of techniques based on the medical value and economically important Nepalese botanical species will be carried out. To supply medicines to the people at reasonable price, to maintain the quality of necessary medicines required for effective health services, and to produce effective medicine by using most modern pharmaceutical techniques the Royal Drugs Limited will be permitted to produce 35 varie ties of new medicines in the Seventh Plan. Training Programme For the successful implementation of forest development, land and watershed protection and related programmes necessary training programmes will be conducted. J. Research Programme Research programme will be implemented in order to solve the problems such as lack of forest products, land erosion calamities faced by the country and to support different programmes. The following working policy will be adopted for this : 1. Research will be carried out for planting fast growing saplings and plants suitable to the areas having different altitudes, soil and climate and developing techniques for growing and management systems. 2. Research will be carried out for techniques for protecting the land and watershed economically. 3. Research will be conducted for developing techniques related to agro forestry for the areas which appear to be different from the consideration of climate, soil and altitudes. K. \\tOther Programmes 1. Timber, Firewood Production Production and marketing of timber and firewood will be done by the corporation and committee on the basis of markings done by the Department of Forests, Ministry of Forest and Land Protection in the specified spot of the forest keeping in mind the environment balance. 2. Turpentine Industry By completing the constructions works of the turpentine industry initiated in the \\'Sixth Plan production of rosin and turpentine will be started. With regard to the rehabilitation executed by clear felling of invaluable forest resources, the forest area has been reduced to less than the minimum required for maintaining the natural and ecological balance and, hence, there is no room for rehabilitation by converting the forest land to agricultural land by clear felling in the hills or terai. Programmes will be imple mented in the Seventh Plan according to the policy of giving a or land allocation just enough to engage in small industrial undertakings for settling the victims of natural calamities by giving training in the hills and terai. The following working policy will be adopted for this : 1. Rehabilitation will be carried out by establishing rehabilitation centres at feasible places and by allocating land for residential plots for industries and trades. 2. The victims will be handed in skills for associating them in some vocation or small scale industries. 3. Services will be made available to the victims from the rehabilitation centres for a definite period only. 4. Institutions will be held responsible for rehabilitating the people resettled by their programmes to new places. 5. The remaining rehabilitation programmes of the Sixth Plan will be completed in the first year of the Seventh Plan. As a result of top priority given in the initial periodic plans to launching and implementation of projects related to development of transport sector, providing physical infrastructure for all-around development of the country, most parts of the country are now interlinked internally without the compulsion of having to use foreign land for transportation. The achievements made in the field of road transportation over the last three decades of planned development are certainly encouraging. The length of road in the kingdom by fiscal year 1976/80, the final year of the Fifth Plan, came up to 4,940 kilometer as compared to mere 624 km, is fiscal year 1955/56, the first year of the First Plan period. Fourth year of the Sixth Plan (fiscal year 1983/84) has also shown some changes in the situation of road. Of the total length of 5,717 km. roads by the fourth year (1983/84) of the sixth plan, the highest length of roads on zonal basis is in Bagmati zone, both in quantity and kind. Of the above total length in the kingdom, Bagmati zone has 1,109 km, (19.40 percent). Lumbini zone, with second position, has a length of 792 km roads. Mechi, Koshi, Sagarmatha, Janakpur, Gandaki, Rapti, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali zones have 570, 388, 364, 429, 305, 454, 271, 183 and 281 km. roads respectively. The above table shows that except for Karnali and Dhawalagiri zones, the situation of roads in other zones is improving step by step. Progress Review of the Sixth Plan The current Sixth Plan had proposed to construct a number of roads and bridges and launch other related programs with the objectives of consolidating national and regional integrity by linking different parts of the country, bolstering economic and social uplift with the maintenance of regional balance, linking tourist resorts and project sites of national importance and, developing and expanding rural transportation. In addition policies such as emphasis on early completion of east-west and north-south highways, selection of feeder roads on the ba sis of economic necessity and according priority to rural roads to provide minimum transport facility were also adopted. The roads development projects implemented in the past years were ass per the declared objective and policies and working policies, formulation of master plan for mule trail construction to develop rural transportation was left out. Likewise the working policies related to suspension bridges and improved  over streams and rivulets on village trails also remained incomplete. As for the physical progress achieved during the plan, altogether 1,516-kilometer road was constructed by the fourth year of the plan against the plan period. Keeping in view the target set for the final year of the Sixth Plan (fiscal year 1984/85), altogether 1,749-km. road is expected to be constructed during the plan period. The following table presents the target and progress relating to roads construction during the Sixth Plan. Target and Es timated Progress in Roads Transportation During the Sixth Plan, 1979/80-1984/85 Preliminary estimation On analyzing the process achieved in road sector in the Sixth Plans period, it becomes clear that the implementation level of back-topped road was the best. O the total target of constructing 672 km. back-topped road in the whole plan period,601 km. has already has been constructed in the first four years achieving a progress of 89.44 percent as per target. The progress in this direction, hence, seems to go as per target. The progress of gravel led road seems to fall short of target whereas that of fair weather rough motorable road is expected to exceed the target. The entire roads project implemented in the Sixth plan with the objective of achieving the above physical targets were categorized under three main programs, namely highways, feeder roads, and main urban and headquarters roads. Accordingly, 562 km. of highways, 797 km. of feeder roads and 157 km. main urban and headquarters roads were constructed during the first four years of the Sixth plan. The following table presents the achievements made in the first four years of the Sixth Plan in roads construction on the basis of their kind. As for projects implementation, blacktopping has been carried out on the remaining 38 km portion of Hetauda-Narayangadh road, 154 km of Butwal-Kohalpur road, and among north-south highways. 40 km of Dharan-Dhankuta road, 61 km of Gorkha-Narayangadh road and 30 km of Mahendra highway (Charili) Kanyam- Illam road. In addition the 73. km Illam-Fidim road has been improved for truck transport ation. Likewise the construction of Dadeldhura-Baitadi-Darchula road is expected to proceed as per target. Construction of the 84 m Dadeldhura-Dipayal-Doti road in the Far-Western Development Region is to be completed to suit one-line truck transportation. But Kohalpur-Mahalkali road and Mahendra highway (Kohalpur)-Surkhet road is not likely to be completed as per target. Feeder roads such Mahendra highway-Sanischare, Mahendra highway-Ggauriganj, Mahendra highway- Shripur, Trishuli-Gandaki, Nepalgunj-Baghada, Nepalganj-Gulariya have remained initial phase. Evaluation the progress during the last four years vindicates that the promotion of panchayat roads to feeder roads and construction of roads under integrated rural development projects are to fall short of target. Bottlenecks and Problems The reasons for gap between target and progress in the current plan are attributed to failure to reach agreement on projects such as Kohalpur-Mahakali road on time, failure to carry out feasibility study, lack of timely distribution of contract, shortage of construction materials and equipment negligence of contractors to carry out works on time and the like. Bridges and Suspension Bridges Of the 15 motorable bridges including those on Tribhuvan highway and Pathlaiya-Dhalkevar portion of Mahendra highway targeted to be constructed in the current Sixth plan, six bridges have been completed and a maximum of three expected to be completed in the fiscal year1984/85, the total bridges to be constructed coming up to nine only. The Duhabi bridge (Sunsari), Man bridge (Bardia) and the bridges on Hetauda-Narayangadh portion were completed during the period. As for reconstruction of bridges, the  (nearing completion), the bridge leading to Mahendra Gufa (Kaski) and the bridge on Pathalaiya Dhalkebar portion of Manendra highway were completed. Of the targeted 300 suspension bridge to be constructed during the Sixth Plan, 99 suspension bridge have been constructed in the fourth year (1982/84) of the plan period and an additional 56 are expected to be constructed in the final year (1984/85). The reasons for not fulfilling the target of motorable bridges are lack of timely designing, problem problems relating to constructs and also low efficiency in Department of Roads to construct bridges. Likewise the bottlenecks facing suspension bridge sector, are lack of timely awarding of constructs, transportation problem of construction materials, shortage of technicians and problem of choosing project site. Financial Progress The Sixth Plan had targeted to spend Rs 3020 million at fixed price for the conduction of roads development programs including bridges. Of the total sum of Rs 3020 million Rs 2390 million was allocated for roads (including foot trail, mule trail and motorable road) and Rs 630 million for bridges and suspension bridges. By the end of the Sixth Plan, in fiscal year 1984/85, the expenditure in the current ma rket price is to reach Rs3235.5 million. Objective, Policies and Programs of the Seventh Plan More attention has to be paid to development of roads and bridges, which occupy important place in transportation. Although the total length of roads is to reach 6,000 km by the end of the Sixth Plan in fiscal year 1984/85, works to link hilly areas to terai and to eliminate inaccessibility of most of the hilly districts by providing roads transportation have yet to be done. It is more evident in the context of increasing demand by panchayat units and local people. Keeping in mind our past experiences in this field, more alertness is called for in roads construction as well as in rendering the roads constructed inn the plan periods economically more used. A study report carried out in 1983 showed that the density of vehicular traffic and some of the important highways was 500 km vehicles per days, while that on some other roads 200 to 300 vehicles per day. Lack of congenial environment to render roads, especially highway, more useful from economic point of view is responsive for low traffic density. On the other hand maintenance of roads is a very expensive task in a country like Nepal Roads which give very low economic benefit are neglected in maintenance, too, and investment in such roads is fruitless. In view of these facts, more alertness is called for Seventh Plan concerning the programmes in road development. Objectives Following are the objectives of the Seventh Plan in road development. 1. \\tto consolidate national integrity by linking different regions of the country. 2. \\tto launch economically more productive roads projects, to raise the national growth rate, generate productive employment and fulfil basic requirements of people 3. \\tto bolster tourism besides maintaining regional balance and economic unification by the development of suitable roads. 4. \\tto bolster urbanization. 5. \\tto develop rural transportation system so as to facilitate the people of backward and remote area with secure transportation and easy accessibility, thereby bolstering the development of rural sector. The following working policies will be adopted to achieve the above objectives and successful implementation of above policies. 1. A 20-year master plan to bolster systematic development of roads will be formulated and under the master plan certain time-bound projects will be formulated and implemented on a gradual basis. Special emphasis will be given on up-to-date inventory maintenance of feasibility study to seek foreign aid and mobilization of local resources in their launching. 2. Special attention will be paid to regular maintenance and periodic repairs of roads in order to avoid the incurrence of heavy cost likely to ensure from delay of such actives. 3. Priority wills be given to the shortest and most straight course while constructing east-west and north-south roads of national importance. Policy to link highways and headquarters with the shortest possible feeder roads will also be adopted. 5. While carrying out feasibility study on roads, technical and economic prospects of some other alternative courses will be seen comparatively, and on the basis of such comparative study the most suitable course will be chosen for implementation. 6. Local panchayats will be made available technical assistance from the center in an effort to extend transport facility to remote districts in the shortest time possible and meet the demand of the country for roads in accordance with the decentralized policy of giving active role to local panchayats. In addition concrete steps will be taken to bring about coordination among various agencies related to traffic. 8. In conformity with decentralized act local panchayats will be encouraged to mobilize resources to construct mule trails and motorable roads suited to national transport system and also suspension bridges and other suitable bridges over streams and rivers along such main conjunctions. The center will provide necessary technical cooperation to districts in this regard. 9. In view of increasing traffic density in Kathmandu valley, a master plan concerning development and improvement of urban roads ill be formulated and program launched on a gradual basis. 10. Special attention will be paid to timely completion of roads project being constructed by resolving their problems. 11. A high level committee will be constituted to successfully implement and monitor programs to be launched in  in accordance with the declaration of transport and communications decade for  and the pacific. Priority Order The following priority order will be maintained in the development of road transport in the Seventh Plan. 1. The Kohalpur-Mahakali portion of Mahandra highways in Mid- and Far-western development regions and north-south highways under construction, which have been included in national priority projects. 2. Works relating to maintenance and repairs of highways and feeder roads. 3. Rural transport media such as mule trails, foot trails, through fares, suspension bridges and other bridges which can bolster national transport system 4. As for new roads projects, roads and bridges bolstering productive sector on the basis of availability of resources and socio-economic requirement. Physical Target The Seventh Plan has set a target of constructing 1981 kilometers of roads, Of the total roads to be constructed, Altogether 21 motorable bridges will be constructed during the plan period. Under district level projects, 373 suspension bridges will be constructed. In addition, the Seventh Plan has a target of providing roads facility to Karnali zone in mid-western and  zone in Western development region. Classification of Roads The Fifth Plan had brought improvement in preceding classification of roads in to national and local roads. In this connection the national roads were classified into highways, feeder roads and main urban roads The Sixth Plan had also brought minor changes in the Fifth Plan classification by sub-classifying local roads into motorable roads, mule trails and foot trails and keeping intact the classification of national roads. The Seventh Plan has made arrangement to classify roads into national and district level and construct highways, feeder roads and main urban roads of national level from the center. Urban district level roads, all motorable roads, mule trails, foot trails and other local trail have been included. The district level roads will be incorporated in district level projects and implemented at local level. Main Programs: Projects relating development of transport to be launched in accordance with the objective and policies of the Seventh Plan have been classified under seven headings. a. Construction of Highways Highways play a crucial role among all roads, which are infrastructure for all round development of the country. Keeping this in mind, the past periodic projects had paid special attention to development of highways in particular. High priority as accorded to construction of roads in this connection. As a result highways linking different north-south and east-west parts of the country such as major portions of Mahendra highway and some north-south highways have already been constructed. Keeping this fact in view, the proposed north-south and east-west highways in mid-mountain areas will be constructed as fair weather roads with one way structures in the initial phase and later will be promoted gradually into standard forms on the basis of growth in t raffic density. Due attention will be paid to bringing the existing highways into maximum use during the plan period. The proposed highway level roads projects have been classified into three heading: a. the remaining portion of Mahendra highway b. north-south highways cc. east-west highways of mid-mountain areas. Altogether 17 road projects have been included under these three projects. Of the total roads to be constructed, 257 km will be blacktopped, 299 km gravelled and 500 km soiler or rough truckable. The details of these roads are given below. The remaining Portion of The total length of Mahendra Hithway, which will link different parts of the country and assume the status of A2 portion Asian highway, is estimated to be 1034 km,. Of the estimated total length, 893 km has already been constructed and of this 786 km has been black-topped. This highway is being constructed by various sectors. By the fourth year of the Sixth Plan all portions of eastern, central and western development regions including parts of 204-km. Kohalpur-Mahakali portion have been completed. A 25-km portion of this highway in mid-western development region has been completed. The entire works on remaining 204-km portion of this highway will be completed during the Seventh Plan. Under the program laid out for construction of the remaining portion of Mahendra highway, two projects have been included. 1. Butwal-Kohalpur The entire works on roads construction is expected to be completed in fiscal year 1984/85, the final year of Sixth Plan. The remaining works of a bridge on this highway is targeted to be completed in the first year of the Seventh Plan. 2. Kohalpur-Mahakali Kohalpur-Mahakali road as the last portion of Mahendra highway will contribute significantly to national unification as well as all-round development of Mid -western and Far-western Development Region. This project was launched during the Fourth Plan with local technicians and other resources and by the fourth Plan with local technicians and other resources and by the fourth year of the Sixth Plan altogether 76 km-25 km black topped, 25 gravelled and 26 km rough-roads were constructed. The Seventh Plan has targeted to complete the entire remaining portions of this road at black-topped level. North-South Highways In view of the fact that linking different parts of terai by Mahendra highway only cannot speed up the pace of national development to the extent desired, a need to integrate the economy of the Himalayan and mountain areas with that of terai areas is realize this goal. These highways were proposed to be launched in the form of roads for development. Different road projects were included under this program in the Fifth Plan also. Highway projects launched during the Fifth Plan but lying incomplete were included in the Sixth Plan. There is a target of constructing altogether 755 km roads under north-south highwa ys construction program during the Seventh Plan of the total length of roads be constructed under this program, 89 km will be black-topped, 299 km gravelled and 367 km soiled. The accounts of projects under north-south highways program are given below separately. a). Mechi Highway: This highway in Mechi zone of Eastern Nepal starts from Charili on Mahendra Highway and reaches Taplejung via Kanyam, Ilam and Fidim. The highway estimated to be 215 km in length is divided into three portions and construction is being launched in accordance with the division. The three portions of the highway which are among national priority projects are Mahendra highway (Charali) Ilam road, Ilam-Fidim road and Fidim- Taplejung road. 1. Mahendra Highway-Ilam: The 47 km remaining part of this first portion of Mechi high way is targeted to be black-toped in the Seventh Plan. 2. Illam-Fidim: The total length of Illam-Fidim road which is middle portion of Mechi highway is 69 km. Construction of this road in rough form has been completed in the first four year of the Sixth Plan. This road is targeted to be gravelled during the Seventh Plan. 3. Fidim-Taplejung: This last portion of Mechi highway is estimated to be 80 km long. Major structures of this road will be completed along with gravelling 30 km. and constructing 50 km. in rough form. b. \\tKoshi Highway: Koshi zone in the eastern development region is one of the important zones of the country. The idea of this highway is conceived to link the Himalayuan, hilly and terai areas of this zone. Construction of this road is also being launched portionwise. Dharan-Dhankuta portion of this highway has been completed. The remaining two portions of this high are 1. Dhankuta-Hile and, 2. Hile-Khandbari. 1. Dhankuta-Hile: This 17-km.-portion fromDhankuta, the headquarters of eastern development region, to Hilewas gravelled during the Sixth Plan. This entire road is targeted to be black-topped during the Seventh Plan under Koshi hill integrated rural development program. 2. Hile-Khandbari: At a preliminary estimate, the total length of this last portion of Koshi highway is expected to be 67 km. c. \\tSagarmatha Highway: The total length of Sagarmatha (north-south) highway which starts fromMirchaiya on Mahendra hig hway and reaches Salleri, the headquarters of Solukhumbu, via Udayapur, Khotang and Okhaldhunga is estimated to be 200 km. Feasibility study on Katari or Gaighat to Solu Salleri portion of this highway will carried out in the Seventh Plan along with survey of other suitable alternatives and cost estimates calculated accordingly. As for construction of this portion of the highway, 20 km of truckable road with structure will be constructed in important places. d. \\tRapti Highway: There is a policy of developing the north-south roads being constructed Rapti zone of mid - western development region in the form of Rapti highway. In accordance with this policy, this highway is divided into three portions: Amelia-Tulsipur portion of Mahendra highway itself, Tulsipur-alyan and Salyan- Chaurjahari-Musikot. 1. Amelia-Tulsipur: This road in Dang district linked Amelia with Tulsipur and a length of 41 km. It is in rough condition at present. 16 km portion of this road will be gravelled during the Seventh Plan 2. Tutsipur-Salyan: This road lying in Dang and Salyan districts is being constructed under Rapti inregrated rural development project. This road will be broadened along with construction of necessary structures during the Seventh Plan. 3. Salyan-Chaurjahari-Musikot: Detail survey designing and cost estimates of this road project which will link Salyan and Rukum districts will be carried out during the Seventh Plan. e. \\tKarnali Highway: With a long to linking Bheri and Karnali zones in the mid-western development regio n in the form of Nepalgunj-Jumla highway, this highway proposed for construction on a gradual basis during the fourth plan. The Nepalganj-Kohalpur and Kohalpur-Surkhet portion of this highway have already been constructed and transport service provided through them. The Seventh Plan has targeted to implement the following objectives pertaining to i) Kohalpur-Surkhet and, ii) Surkhet-Dailekh -Jmla portions of this highway. Karnali zone will receive transport facility on carrying out these objectives. 1. Kohalpur-Surkhet: This road linking Bange Simal of Surkhet valley in mid -western development region with Kohalpur on Mahendra highway will be 92 km long. Under this project, 13 km black-topped, 16 km gravelled and 63 km rough roads have been completed in the first four years of the Sixth Plan. The Seventh Plan had targeted to gravel the entire remaining portion of this road along with constructing the entire bridges. 2. Surkhet: The total length of this highway linking Surkhet, the center of Mid-western Development Region with Jumla, the headquarters of Karnali zone will be 200 km. Detailed survey and designing of this road will be carried out during the Seventh Plan along with constructing 100 km fair weather truckable road. : The road which forms the north-south in the Far-western Development Region will link Dhangadi with Dandeldhura and its length is estimated to be 196 km. With the completion of the road the inaccessible districts of Mahakali zone will get minimum transportation facilities. The Dangadhi-Darchula road is being constructed in three sections: i) Dhangadi-Dandeldhura road ii) Dandeldhura -Baitadi road iii) Baitadi-Darchula road. 2. Dandeldhura-Baitadi: About 56 km of jeepable track was completed mobilizing people\\'s labour constrribution during the Fifth Plan. The Sixth Plan had given top priority to this project as it complements the Mahhakali Integrated Rural Development Project. As a result, 86 km portion of this road is to be gravelled during the Seventh Plan 4. Baitadi-Darchla: It is estimated that the length of this north-south road will be 110 km. This road will make the remote Darchula district of Mahakali zone into accessible one. It will also help intensify development activities in the district. Durin g the Seventh Plan the entire length of 110 km. of this road will be constructed as a fair weather road for truck vehicle with structures in major places. g. Mid-Hill East West way: Mid - has been conceived and the policy has been adopted to construct it gradually in order to avoid limiting east-west highway network in terai only; to linked all the five development regions located in hill areas: integrated fragmented economic and social activities of the hill and activise hill economy. Demarcation Survey of the highway was carried out tentatively at Phidim of Mechi zone in the east and Dandeldhura of Mahakali zone in the Far-western Development Region. Dhankuta- 370 km; Kathmandu-Pokhara 200 km; Pokhara -Surkhet 400; and Surkhet-Ridikot (Doti)- Dandeldhura 352 km. Thus the total length of this road is envisaged to be 1,424 km. The construction of this highway will not only provide road transportation network to the hilly districts but also make important contribution to unify all the five development centers and help significantly to strengthen national integration. In consonance with the policy of gradually constructing various sections of the Mid -hill , the Seventh Plan envisages to undertake the following projects : The total length of the road linking Bansantapur of Dhankuta to the district headquarters of Terhathum is estimated to be 13 km. The road will be constructed under the Koshi Hill Area Development Project and will form a part of the Mid -hill . The Seventh Plan has targeted to complete one way track for truck transportation. 2. Pokhara-Baglung: This road will sstart from Pokhara of Western Development Region and terminate at Baglung, the headquarters blacktopped. It is envisaged that the fair waeather track will be laid out for 65 km. road during the Seventh Plan. 3. Dandeldhura-Dipayal-Doti: The 84 km. road will start from Dandeldhura of Mahakali zone and reach Dipayal, the center of the Far Western Development Region and Silghadhi Doti, the district headquarters of Doti district. One way track was laid down to Dipayal by the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, fiscal year 1983/84. The Seventh Plan envisa gets to complete the gravelling work on the remaining section of this road. h. Construction of Feeder Roads: Construction of feeder roads was initiated in the previous plan along with new road project in order to render existing highways more useful and activise economic and social activities on and social activities on and around the road areas. As in the Fifth Plan, the construction of roads was classified in four categories during the Sixth Plan: i) Feeder roads of the highways, ii) upgrding panchayat roads into feeder roads, and iv) feeder roads to be constructed on the basis of feasibility studies. The Sixth Plan has target to undertake 33 projects in addition to the feeder roads to be decided on the basis of feasibility studies. Altogether 979 km road was completed during the four year of the Plan under different projects and various one track jeep roads were converted into truckable roads. The Seventh Plan has formulated program with a view to complete various projects now under construction. Details of feeder roads are given below: 1. Mahendra Highway-Sindhuli This 37 km road passes through Mohattari, Dhanusha and Sindhuli districts of Janakpur zone and links the Sindhuli district headquarter Sindhulimadi with . During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, a fair weather road construction was completed on this project. The Seventh Plan envisages to upgrade this road to gravelled level with all necessary structures. 2. Dumbre-Beshi Shahar: This 42-km road will start from Dumre in Tanahun district on the  and reach Beshi Shahar, the headquarters of Lamjung district. The road construction was initiated with people\\'s labour contribution during the Fifth Plan and single-track road was laid out during the first four year of the Sixth Plan. The target for the Seventh Plan is to gravel the entire length of the road and enable the flow of traffic throughout the year. 3. Lumbini-Taulihawa The total length of this road, linking Taulihawa the headquarters of Kapilbastu district and Lumbini, is estimated to be 47 km. Under this project, fair weather roads has been constructed during the four-year of the Sixth Plan. This road has become a basic infrastructure for the development of Tilaurakot, which is an integral part of Lumbini project. There, the Plan envisages to gravel 25 km. of this road. 4. Trisuli-Dhunche-Somdang This road, which is estimated to be 105 km starts from Trishuli of Nuwakot district and passes through the headquarter of Rasuwa district, and ends in Somdang. By the end of the fiscal year 1983/84 three bridges and three culverts were completed and 13 km was gravelled. During the Seventh Plan the target is to construct a fair weather truckable road in the remaining section of this road. Special emphasis has been given to construct this road in view of this zinc and lead industries located in the Ganesh Himal. 6. Mahendra Highway-Pattarkot-Sandikhark This road, linking Sandhikhark the headquarter of Arghakhachi district, Lumbini zone, with , is 72 km in length. The target of the Sixth Plan was to construct a 28-km truckable and upgrade the existing 20 km road to truckable road. By the end of the terminal year of the Sixth Plan i.e. fiscal year 1984/85, a 72-km fair weather road was completed along with gravelling of 11 km. During the Seventh Plan, the target is to construct the remaining 61-km of fair weather road and bridge culverts retaining wall, and other necessary structures and widen the road to enable the traffic throughout the year. 7. Tansen-Ridhi-Tamghas World Food Program and people\\'s participation during the Fifth Plan. This road, connects Tansen, the headquarters of Palpa district, with Tamghas of Gulmi district via Ridhi. It is estimated to be of 75 km long. A 75 km fair weather road has been completed during the first four years of the Sixth Plan i.e. by the fiscal year 1983/84. During the Seventh Plan, the target is to construct bridges, culverts and the retaining walls and other necessary structures on the road, together with the construction of the fair-weather road enable the traffic throughout the year. This road will facilitate transportation between Palpa ad Gulmi districts and also benefit the people of the nearby area. 8. Khodpe-Bajhang This road, linking Khodpe of Baitadi district, Mahakali zone, and Chainpur the headquarter of Bajhang district of Seti zone and directly benefit the people of this region. Detailed survey and feasibility studies of the 50-km road have been completed during the first four-year of the Sixth Plan. The Seventh Plan envisages to construct 60 km fair weather road in this priority project. 9 \\tBusti -Khimiti -Ramechhap This road, linking Busti of Dolakha and Ramechhap in Janakpur zone, is envisaged to be 55 km long. During the Seventh Plan, the target is to construct a single-track fair-weather road on the basis of feasibility study of this road. 10. Malekhu-Dhading This road, connecting Malekhu of the  with the headquarters of Dhading district, is 20 km long. The Sixth Plan had envisaged to upgrade this road too a single-track road to suit truck transportation. The target for the Seventh Plan is to gravel this road. 11. Fikal -Pashupati Nagar This road, linking Fikal of Ilam district with Pashupati Nagar, is 11 km long. About threekilometers of this road has been blacktopped. The remaining part of the road is envisaged to be blacktopped under the feeder road project, financed through the credit of the Asian Development Bank. 12. Nepalgunj-Gularia This road, linking the district headquarters of Bane and Bardiya, is 38 km in length. The gravelling and blacktopping of this road were envisaged by the Fifth Plan respectively. However, only 16 km portion was completed during this period due to various reasons. The construction of the bri dge across the Man river along this road has been completed and the construction of bridge over the Bhadra river has already been started. When completed, this will not only ease then social problems experienced by the people in the district but also greatly help cotton farming and other development works of this area. THe Seventh Plan envisages to construct 22 km gravelled road in this project. of Karnali-Mangalo Area As the Kohalpur-Mahakali section of the  passes through Chisapani, this road has been included in the porject to provide access to  to the people linking in southern stream of the Karnali river 60 km gravelled road will be constructed under the project. under the IRDPS and Other Projects Some roads projects are at the last stage of their construction. Necessary structural construction and improvement were carried out in Tulsipur- Salyan, Ghorahi-Piuthan and Chakchake-Rolpa-Liwang roads under the Rapti Rural Development Project. C. Major Urban Roads In view of the growing density of population and the vehicular traffic in Kathmandu valley, the urban road construction in  valley has been included under central level project in order to provide organized transportation in the capital city which is rapidly developing to a cosmopolitancity. During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, the graveled and fair weather urban road construction in  valley was 36 km and 37 km respectively. During the Seventh Plan period, the target for urban road construction in  valley is 80 km of black topped including surface improvement ad upgrading, 80 km of gravelled, 80 km of gravelled road and 30 km of fair weather roads with a combined total of 190 km. D. Roads Repair and Maintenance E. Road Construction, Maintenance Equipment, Workshop Establishment and Training As construction, maintenance and repair of ongoing highways, feeder roads and other roads are constantly required, the Seventh Plan, as in the Sixth Plan, has made provision like roller, dodger, truck, tipper, etc. for road construction and maintenance along with necessary spare parts. In addition to this, training will be provided to the operators and mechanic s of the Roads Department for the smooth handling of the existing and new machinery and equipment use in roads construction and repair-maintenance works. Concerning workshop equipment and workshop, two heavy equipment division will be set up, one each in Nepalgunj and Godavari of Kailali district. Further more, in view of the growing repair0maintenance works, necessary workshop building equipment will be provided for the 13 sub-divisions and 23 servicing depots in various parts of the country. F. Feasibility Study, Design and Survey Works The Seventh Plan target is to conduct feasibility studies and detailed survey works on the highways included in the Sixth Plan and those that are deemed important from the transit and foreign trade point of view under the central level program. Some of the major roads proposed for the feasibility studies are 1) Sindhuli-Kvre 2) Ridhi-Dhorpatan and other roads, which are important from national viewpoint. Under this heading, the programs included are traffic survey and research, land acquisition and compensation, construction and repair of mule track in Darchula Tinkerbyas and other stray works. Traffic Survey and Research Tariff Survey and Research are important in order to reduce and control traffic accidents on various roads in the Kingdom. Therefore, Traffic survey and research will be conducted on various roads during the Seventh Plan Land Acquisition and Compensation Construction of highways and feeder roads claims private land of individuals. Therefore acquisition of such land and payment of compensation thereof will be continued during the Seventh Plan also. Darchula Tinker Mule Track The mule track linking Darchula and Tinker in the Far-western Development Region is one of the national priority projects. The mule track construction was initiated by the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development during the Sixth Plan. The remaining work will be completed during the Seventh Plan. Bridge and Suspension Bridges In the context of , it is but natural that bridge, suspension bridge and other means of crossing rivers assume great importance while formulating transportation development program. Therefore top priority was given to the construction of bridge and suspension bridges in the previous plans. An analysis of our achievements in bridge construction during the past years indicates that more efforts are needed in this regard and a separate bridge construction unit is required within the concerned department in order to implement bridge construction. On the one hand, there has been an unprecedented growth in the demand for the construction of motorable bridges in various parts of the Kingdom due to the problems created by the numerous rivers especially during the rainy season. Several bridges, launched during the Sixth Plan, could not be completed due to the lack of increased capability in bridge designing at the Roads Department. Keeping in mind the capability of the Roads Department and limited resources available, the target of the Seventh Plan has been fixed to construct 23 bridges. Construction work on Jamara river (Kailali), Bhada bridge (Bardia), Sirsia bridge (Parsa), Keshlaya bridge (Morang), Bakraha bridge (Morang), Red bridge (Jaleshwar) will be completed during the Plan period. Concerning reconstruction of bridges, the red bridge on Shankhamul and Dhobikhola rivers, and other bridges in Babar Mahal, Siphal and Handigaon will be reconstructed. Similarly construction of bridges on the Bishnumati river across Bhimsen Than, Shobha Bhagati and Dallu will be completed. Five bridges on the road from Naubise to Raxual section will also be reconstructed. Necessary feasibility study and survey for the bridge construction will be continued during the Seventh Plan also. The bridge over   (Kailala) will be designed and constructed under the feeder road project within the Plan period, Besides, study will be conducted to construct a motorable bridge around Teku between  and Lalitpur. Backlog projects from the Sixth plan are also targeted for completion on priority basis. Suspension Bridges As Suspension bridges are one important means of rural transportation system, the center should provide technical back-up for the successful completion of suspension bridge programs being undertaken by local panchayat. In this background, steps will be taken strengthen suspension bridge division at the center. In the context of Decentralization Act and Regulations the role of central level agencies will be re-oriented to provide necessary technical backing to the rural transportation program rather than involve directly in construction works. The Seventh Plan also envisages for the development of rural transport system (1) preparation of directory manual for the training of technical personnel of the districts engaged in the construction suspension bridges, and (2) research and studies to development cable crossing of rivers and streams in the rural hilly areas. Financial Targets The total financial outlay set-aside for the development roads and bridges formulated for implementation during the Seventh Plan is Rs 37730 million. The following table shows the details of program and District Level Plans for Roads Transportation In consonance with the Decentralization plan, centrally administered major projects in the districts have been included within the district level plan. In this context, the policy regarding the district level roads development has been formulated to complete backlog projects, initiated in the districts from the Sixth Plan on priority basis, and construct other view road projects on the basis of feasibility studies. Guided by the above policies, the programs of district level roads development for the Seventh Plan area: 1) complete on-going projects, 2) carry out construction of new road project on the basis of feasibility study, and 3) undertake repair and maintenance of completed projects. The absence of bridges and suspension bridges in most of the rivers and streams has created problems in transportation across different places and villages. This problem becomes especially that bridge and suspension bridges are essential to provide transportation facilities in the hilly and remote districts, which have numerous rivers and streams. In view of the limited available resources under our disposal, it will still require a long time to provide motor road transportation network in al parts of the country. In this context the construction of bridge and suspension bridges on major rivers along the main foot tracks in the hilly and remote regions will also greatly facilitate the movement of common people in rural areas. Keeping this fact in mind, the construction of bridges and suspension bridges as an integral part of rural transportation was accorded top priority since the Fifth Plan. The Sixth Plan emphasized the suspension bridge construction as one of the basic needs of the people. The achievements made in the suspension bridge construction during the past periodic plans reveal that only 10 projects were completed during the Fourth Plan while the figure for the Fifth Plan was 61. The target for suspension bridge construction for the Fifth Plan was set at maximum and minimum targets were 91 and 145 percent respectively. During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, the Suspension Bridges Division had completed 98 suspension bridges. Thus during the first four years f the Sixth Plan, 33 percent of the target has been fulfilled. The regional distribution of the 98 suspension bridges constructed by the Suspension Bridge Division is: Eastern Development Region 15 and Far Western Region 8. The annual progress recorded during the first four years of the Sixth Plan was: fiscal year 1980/81:30; F.Y.1981/82:26; F.Y.1983/84:16. The suspension bridges completed by the Suspension Bridge Division during the first four years of the Sixth Plan are follows: In addition to the Suspension Bridge Division, number of suspension bridges constructed during the first four years of the Sixth Plan under the Remote Area Development Programme of Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development was 39 and 107 bridges under IRD Projects. The Sixth Plan does not seem to have envisaged the construction of suspension bridge under the programmes of Remote Area Development committee. Thus the completion of 206 suspension bridges under the programmes of Suspension Bridges Division and IRD projects during the first four year of the Sixth Plan marks 66 percent against the target. Therefore the suspension bridges completed during the first four year of the Sixth Plan are: Suspension Bridge Division 98, Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development 39, IRD Projects 107. This makes a total of 244 suspension bridges. The Seventh Plan has also accorded top priority to the construction of suspension bridges which are vital for rural transportation. In view of the growing demand for and necessity of the suspension bridges in the country, it is necessary to give serious thought about the ways to construct maximum number of suspension bridges with limited available resources. Therefore, in consonance with the Decentralization Act and Principles, the centrally administered suspension bridge construction programme will be formulated on the basis of the felt needs of the district and implemented accordingly. The following policy consideration will be stressed while formulating suspension bridge programme under the District Level Plan: 1. Complete the backlog projects from the Sixth Plan. 3. As cable crossing of the rivers in rural areas can be constructed at less cost compared to the suspension bridges, consideration will be given to construct safe cable crossing in the streams and rivers along the foot and mule track which have less movement of people. 4. Undertake pilot programmes to construct suspension bridges, utilizing ocal skills, techniques and manpower while constructing intra -village and low span suspension bridges, and emphasize low cost programmes benefiting a larger number of people. Based on the above policies and objectives, the centrally administered suspension bridge programmes for the districts during the Seventh Plan have been classified into the following five headings: 1) Suspension bridge construction. 2) Reconstruction and repair of suspension bridges, 3) Feasibility study, and survey. 4) Development of cable crossing, and 5) Miscellaneous. (1) \\tConstruction of Suspension Bridges During the Seventh Plan, 373 suspension bridges will be constructed in different districts. Of this, 40 are backlog projects and 332 will be new projects. Emphasis will be given to construct suspension bridges on the main foot track and over the rivers on the way to district headquarters. Feasibility study projects have been included to evaluate necessity and select suspension bridges in the districts. Safe cable crossing will be constructed over the rivers in the sparsely populated remote and hilly rural areas. (5) \\tMiscellaneous: Godowns will be constructed under this heading. Godown facilities will be constructed in the districts deemed necessary. Financial Outlay For the district level suspension bridge construction programme, a total of Rs 194.10 million has been allocated during the Seventh Plan. The Programme and budget for the development of roads and ropeways during the Seventh Plan are given below: CHAPTER 28 (B) OHTER TRANSPORTATION There cannot be two opinions about the potential for the development of rope-line, waterways and electric powered transportation system for a hilly country like  with a large number of rivers and streams. However, even after three decades of planned development process, the progress made in this sector has made little impact on the National Transportation System. The Seventh Plan has given special emphasis on these programmes for their potential benefit to the national economy. Progress Review of theSixth Plan The progress made during the Sixth Plan in the development of rope-line, railways and other means of transportation is given below: Under the ropeway strengthening and development programme, the strengthening of the 42 km Kathmandu- Hetauda ropeway is expected to be complete per target. However there has been no progress in the construction of Surkhet-Dailekh ropeway project. Similarly the work envisaged to construct rural ropeway in the hilly region is likely to remain incomplete. Under the railway strengthening and development programme, the 53 Jayanagar-Janakpur- Bijalpur railway is expected to be completed. But regarding the feasibility study for the proposed railway development programme related to Jogbani-Biratnagar, Nautanawa-Bhairahawa-Butwal and Rupaidia-Nepalgunj, only preliminary study could be completed. Feasibility study was undertaken to review Birgunj-Amlekhgunj railway and to convert Birgunj Raxual section to a suitable gauge system. Concerning the expansion of electric powered trolley bus services, the target was to carry out necessary improvement on the 12.73 km Kathmandu-Bhaktapur trolley bus rout and extend the bus route from Surya Binayak of Bhaktpur to   and  in Kirtipur; during the plan period only some arrangements were made to initiate works on Tripureshwar-Shahidgate section. Feasibility study was proposed to introduce trolley bus services in Biratnagar-Dharan, Bhairahawa Butwal and other highways. Concerning the development of urban transportation system, bus terminals and waiting stands were constructed in  and 30 buses were obtained for Nepal Transport Corporation. Under the waterways development programme, the target was to carry out detailed economic and technical studies on the major rivers like the Koshi and Narayani to use them as waterways but only preliminary study has been completed and potential points for the waterways system have been identified on the Koshi, narayani and Karnali rivers. The target for introducing modern boat services on the Narayani river for the safe and regular traffic is likely to require more time. Concerning the development of containerized transportation services, some container trucks were made available to Nepal Transport Corporation. The meagre achievement as against the target and programme was due to weakness in internal administration on the one hand and the limited technical know-how in the development of most of these transportation means on the other. Background of the Seventh Plan Besides roads and air transport development,  has yet to accomplish a lot in the development of railways, ropeways, waterways and other means of transportation. A review of past achievements and the current situation shows that these means of transportation should be developed in a complementary: way with attention given to curtail the growing reliance on petroleum products. In view of the better potential of electric powered transportation system in , concrete steps were taken in this direction is expected to yield positive impact on the nation\\'s balance-of-paymants situation. As a land-locked country,  is facing various difficulties in transit of goods, bothin export to and import from the other countries because of the lack of suitable means of transportation. port is important for \\'s trade with the third countries. During the Fifth Plan, the volumes of export passing through various border customs offices were 62%, 12%, 9% and 3% through Biratnagar, Birgunj, Kakarbhitta and Bhadrapur respectively. A total of 71  percent of imports passed through Birgunj customs office followed by Biratnagar (11 percent), Bhairahawa (8 percent) and Nepalgunj (3 percent). thus, both  and  are likly to benefit if Indian cooperation could be secured to convert meter gauge Indian rail head into broad guageline upto one of the important customs offices on  side considered important from transit view point. Similarly, concerete steps should be taken to better organise domestic transport development programme related to transit purpose. In this context, various studies have indicated that the development of inter model containerized transportation system will reduce transit expenses considerably. The objectives, policies and programmes for the development and expansion of the transport systems were formulated in this light. Objectives The objectives for other transport development during the Seventh Plan are as follows: 1)  Systematize and regulate transit system of the kingdom. 2)  Gradually develop and strengthen other means of transportation like ropeways, railways and water ways. 3)  Systematize public transportation services. Policies The following policies will be pursued to fulfill the above objectives during the Seventh Plan. 1)  Internal transportation development programmes related to  transit services will be conducted in an integrated manner. 2)  To accord priority to explore cooperation from the neighbouring country in order to carry out feasibility study and construction of broad gauge rail links to  port from one of the suitable customs offices from the viewpoint of import and export. 3)  Initiate necessary measures to develop containerized transport services especially to help move goods in trade with the third countries. 4)  In order to reduce the costly import of petroleum products which are largely used for transportation purposes, the policy of gradually developing and expanding electric power based transporttation system such as ropeway, trolley bus services and others will be continued. And the possibility for utilizing external waterways system will also be explored. 6)  Rules concerning public transportation system will be reviewed in order to unify the service conditions of the public transportation system and ensure better service and safety to the public. Private sector will be encouraged to play more active role in this regard. The role of Nepal Transport Corporation will be gradually restricted. 7)  Necessary reforms will be effected in various departments and and corporations related to other transport development system on the basis .of structureal studiies. Steps will. be taken to construct gravity ropeways in the hill areas, in a manner suitable to help transport necessary goods in related district. Policies will be adopted to mobilize private enterpreneurs to develop ropeway transportation. Working Policies The following working policies will be adopted during the Seventh Plan to strengthen the stated objectives and policies: 1)  Necessary measures will be taken to utilize the full capacity and improve service conditions of rail, ropeway and trolley bus services being operated under Nepal Transport Corporation. 2)  Agencies responsible for transport system development will be strenghtened and activized in order to develop ropeway, railway and other public  transportation  system  and  organise  them  systematically. 3)  More private sectoral investment will be encouraged in public transportation service, especially in the bus services. Necessary reforms will be made on provisions like road permit. In urban areas, public transporttation services will be emphasised along with other steps according overall urbanization plans and programmes. 4)  Priority will be given to conduct studies on the development of inter model containerization to strengthen transit facilities for foreign trade. If found suitable, steps will be taken to set up container port station on  side along Nepal-India border. 5)  Emphasis will be given to develop physical facilities in and around customs _ region of Birgunj and Biratnagar to strengthen foreign tracle. 6)  Various steps will be taken to develop internal waterways system. Studies will be conducted to introduce improved boats on experimental basis in some rivers. Coordination will be maintained between the Minis stries of work and Transport and Water Resources in order to formulate concrete programmes in waterways development and their gradual implementation. Programmes In view of the stated objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan, the programmes for other transport development are presented under the following headings: a) Construction, Expansion and Strengthening of Ropeways Ropeway was first introduced in  in the year 1928 with 22.5 km stretch of Dhorsing-Mata Tirtha ropeway which was extended up to Teku in 1947. After the initiation of the planned development effort, the old ropeway was displaced by the 42.14 km ropeway stretch from Hetauda .to Katb.Dlandu. The- designed capacity of this ropeway according to theYcable\\' system is 28 tonne per hour. The ropeway is operated by Nepal Transport Corporation and its improvement and strengthening programme has been started since the Fifth Plan period. Besides, steps will be taken to increase the capacity of existing Kathmandu- Hetauda ropeway and extend it upto Amlekhgunj, if found feasible. Private transport organization will be encouraged to play active role in the mobilization of investment cost for this programme. Study reports on ropeway construction in major areas of the country will be reviewed and necessary steps will be taken for their implementation, if found feasible. Alternative programmes like gravity ropeway are also envisaged in some hiBy areas to transport goods. (b) Railwuay Strengthening and Study Railways was introduced in  in 1928 with the establishment of Raxaul-Amlekhgunj railway. Of this, only 8 km stretch from Raxaul to Birgunj is presently in operation. The 53 km Janakpur-Jayanagar and Janakpur-Bijalpura railway plying in Nepal-India border was started in 1935 and is now being operated by Nepal Transport Corporation. The Fifth Plan initiated strengthening work on this railway which will be completed during the Seventh Plan through Nepal Transport Corporation. Further studies will be conducted to revive Raxaul-Birgunj line in accordance with the preliminary study. (c) Trolley Bus Extension and Study The first electric powerd Trolley Bus in  was introduced in 1975\\\\ 76. The Fifth Plan saw the completion of 13 km Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Trolley Bus line. It is in operatiop at present. As the trolley bus transportation services are based on electric power generated within the country, the policy has been adopted to gradually introduce such services in major urban areas of the kingdom. Therefore, Kathmandu- Bhaktapur trolley bus line in  valley will be extended from Tripureshwor to Shahidgate, Tinkune-Chabahil- Thapathali to Patan gate during the Seventh Plan period. In addition to this, feasibility study will be conducted construct trolley bus line between Biratnagar and Dharan and Bhairahawa-Butwal. A master plan of trolley bus service wil1 be drawn up to develop trolley bus services. d) Development of Public Transportation Services Public bus and truck services play important role in the general transportation system. As such, appropriate rules will be framed to encourage private sector involvement in order to syst_matise development of public transportation services and ensure better and safe facilities to the people. Concrete projects will be undertaken to develop bus terminals for the long distance bus routes. Terminal construction will be carried out on the basis of  formulated projects. e) Containerized Transport System According to the provisions of Nepal-India Trade and Transit Treaty, the imported goods from the third countries via Calcutta port are transported to Nepal through contianer trucks, Keeping this in mind, studies will be conducted regarding inetr model containerized transport system and suitable projects will be formulated and steps will be considered as needed. f) Development of Waterways Most of the rivers in  have perennial flow as they originate in the . The preliminary studies conducted during the previous plan periods have shown that waterways development can be feasible in the terai segment of the Sapta Koshi in the East, the Narayani in the Central region, and the Karnali river in the Far west. It was observed that access to the  was feasible through these routes. It is estimated that the development of waterways will reduce transport cost of goods and incur less investment on the cost of infrastructure. Keeping this in mind, detailed economic and technical studies will be conducted in some segments of these major rivers like the Koshi and Narayani during the Plan period. Necessary foHow-up action will also be undertaken in the rivers deemed feasible for water transport development. Passanger boat services by tbe private sector to the Narayani river from Deughat to Indian border often result into various accidents duc to the lack of minimum safety measures and the use of old dugout boats. Therefore, studies will be conducted during the current plan period on the techniques of improved boat services to strengthen private sector services. Financial Outlay A total of Rs 25.80 million has been allocated to implement the above mentioned projects during the Seventh  Plan. CHAPTER 29 AIR TRANSPORT As a large area of the country consists of high mountains, roads and other means of transport remain scarce and in this context air transport assumes a special significance. Construction of airfields in various mountains and remote districts has provided the foundation of modern air transport development. Before the Sixth Plan, 39 airfields were in operation throughout the kingdom. Of these only 12 were located in the terai and the rest of 27 (69 percent of the total) were in the hills and Himalayan region. However, air services could not be made regular and reliable because most of the small airfields consisted of only runways; there were no other physical and communications facilities. Keeping this in mind, the Sixth Plan emphasis ed creating physical facilities in the existing airfields rather than construct new airfields in order to make the domestic air services more regular and reliable. Special stress was given to develop the Tribhuvan airport in. view of its significance as a link to the international air service. Guided by the policy of overcoming transportationbottlenecks in promoting tourism and foreign trade through domestic and international air services, air transport is being developed in the country. The following table illustrates the growth of airport construction from the First Plan (1956/57) to the fourth year of the Sixth Plan (1983/84) and the number of airports in given years: Before the introduction\\' ofthe planned development efforts, there were no air services in the hill districts; following the initiation of the planned development, air services have been steadily expanded in the hilly and remote regions as well. By the last year (1979/80) of the Fifth Plan, 39 airfields, both with concrete and grass runways, were constructed in the country and the number of airfields reached 41 by 1983/84, the fourth year of the Sixth Plan. Promotion of air-services in the hill districts is necessitated in view of the fact that a large area of the country comprises hills and mountains where road construction in volves a long time, and huge exp enses. Thus, air transport development was emphasised in the hill areas where 30 airfields have already been completed compared to 12 airports in the plains of terai. Of the total airfields, 72 percent (30) are .located in the \\'hills while only 28 percent (J 2) are in the terai region. The number of airfields in various zones and districts of the Kingdom are: Mechi zone 2, Koshi 3, Sagarmatha 6, Gandaki 3, Lumbini 1, Janakpur 3, Narayani 3, Bagmati 2,  3, Rapti 3, Bheri 2, Karnali 3, Seti 5 and Mahakali 2. The details of type and length of each of the airportsare given in the following table : Progress Review of the Sixth Plan During the Sixth Plan period, the programmes for air transport development were: to expand international air services to boost tourism development and foreign trade; develop domestic air services in the areas without road transport facilities; equip the existing airports with minimum necessary physical facilities and install navigational and communication equipment; strengthen the domestic air-services in order to make them reliable; conduct feasibility study for the alternate international airport and produce middle and low level manpower required for civil aviation within the country. In consonance with the above objectives and policies, two stol airfields were targeted for construction during the plan period of which one was completed by the fourth year of the project and the other one will be completed by the fiscal year of 1984/85. In addition to this, the targets were also set to construct and strengthen five airports and expand runways of five stol airfields. Under the Airport Construction and Strengthening programme, five projects were carried out in , Nepalgunj airport, Pokhara airport, Surkhet airport and Dhangadi airport. The target for  project was to construct 1,200 meter runways to the north and 1045 meter to the south, 555 meter taxi way, to strengthen 16,000 square meter aircraft parking approach, completion of international terminal building and other construction works, and begin construction of domestic terminal building under the second phase progra mme; however, the task completed was civil works related to filling in soil for international terminal building, access road construction and landscaping. With regard to creating additional physical facilities, the existing international terminal section was improved and expanded; boring was installed for water supply system; and construction of security guards house and firemen\\'sdormitory was completed as per the targets. However, the targets for the construction of domestic and international terminal buildings, VIP sheds, 10 km peripheral and cross roads, civil maintenance yard, and cross strip western locator building (in Dhaarke) have remained incomplete. The targets concerning the communications and navigational aids, the equipment were repaired and maintained and the designs were prepared for the transfer of navigational equipment to the newly constructed buildings. The target for constructing a huge hanger, however, has remained incomplete. On the  project, a feasibility study was conducted in Chhire danda for constru cting a new airport and a total of 3106 ropani land was acquired and compensation paid for. But the airport construction with a runway length of 1750 meter has remained incomplete. Construction of an Avro standard airport was completed in the Nepalgunj airport project. Though blacktopping of the runway was completed, necessary correction on the faulty construction is yet to be carried out. The construction of terminal sheds, tower section, staff quarters and security guard has been completed. The construction for water supply system has begun and buildings for receiving station, transmitting station and repeater station as well as  5 km entry road were completed. No work seems to have been done to meet the targets of the Sixth Plan concerning the construction of aircraft hanger, maintenance yard, and cargo sheds. In the Surkhet airport project, the targets fixed were: expansion of terminal building, security guard house and staff quarters, 2500 meter concrete drainage construction, water distribution system and fencing; .of this, works completed were 3000 meter concrete drainage construction, staff quarters, security guard house and water distribution system. Under the provision of installing additional physical facilities the targets were fixed to construct terminal buildings at 7 airports and 17 stol airfields, together with staff quarters and security guard houses, drainage system, river control, fencing, generator shed, and others. In Chandragadhi airport, drainage, fencing --and yard construction were completed. In Biratnagar airport, the tasks completed were staff quarters and workshop building, fire station, cross road and water distribution system. In Tumlingtar airport, the targets were to carry out land-slide prevention works (at four sites); completion of drainage system, expansion of terminal building, construction of staff quarters and water distribution system; however, the tasks completed were land-slide control measures, concrete drainage system, expansion of terminal building and constn.1ction of staff quarters. In Rajbiraj airport, the target of errecting 15,000 feet fencing and drainage works was not completed: In Janakpur airport, the targets were to strengthen_ runways and drainage system, water distributions ystem, generator shed construction, staff quarters, fire control station and cross road, of which only drainage and water distribution system were carried out. In Simra airport, the targets were to construct fire control station, staff quarters and remaining portion of the terminal building of which only the remaining work of terminal building was completed. In Pokhara airport (old), workshop building was completed per targets. Concerning stol airfields, construction of terminal building, security guard house and staff quarters will be completed in Taplejung as per target Similarly, at Lukla stol airfield, terminal building construction and fencing were completed; at Lamidanda stol airfield staff quarters were constructed while in Baitadi terminal building and staff quarters were constructed and a hillock facing the runways was removed; at Jomsom stol airfield, staff quarters were completed while at Dolpa airfield the runway gradient was improved and terminal building completed. Likewise, staff quarters were completed at Bajhang and Rukum stol airfields. At Sanphe Bagar and Dipayal airfields, the construction of staff quarters was in progress as per the target. Similarly, the target of completing staff quarters and security guard houses at Rolpa (Badachaur) stol airfield 100ks like to remain incomplete. Under the Stol airfield construction, improvement and expansion programme , the target was to construct two new airfields in Bajura (Kunakalti) and Darchula (Gokuleshwar) of which one was completed the other was likely to have completed by the end of fiscal year 1984/85. Of the existing stol airfields, runway improvement was planned in five airfields at Phaplu, Baglung, Jumla, Ramechhap and Lamtang, of this runway expansion was completed at Phaplu, Ramechhap and Lamtang. Similarly, runway expansion work was done at Baglung and Jumla airfields. In addition to this, runway expansion was carried out at Rumjatar (Okhaldhunga), Suketar (Taplejung) and Marse (Bhojpur) stol airfields which was not envisaged under the plan. Concerning the expansion of communications and navigational aids, TMASIS and approach light were acquired for Biratnagar and Bhairahawa airports as envisaged under the plan, though they are yet to be installed; the plan for creating a western locator beak on in the Far-Western Development Region was carried out in Chamire Danda installing equipment for a repeater station and flight equipment service (FIC) were fitted in the operation tower at Nepalgunj airport. Similarly, under the communications and navigational aids for the stol airfields programme, installation of equipment were fitted at Rolpa airfield. Regarding the targets for installing solar and wind powered communications equipment, contract arrangements have been made to obtain necessary equipment for 15 different airports. Under the fire control and life saving services the plan envisaged acquiring a large foam tender fire engine, a large water tender (fire engine), ambulance and disaster relief medicines for  and one foam tender (fire engine) each for Biratnagar, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj and no progress was recorded in this regard. Under the miscellaneous heading, the plan was to complete the feasibility study for the construction of an alternate international airport of which only preliminary study was carried out. During the last four years, the civil aviation training centre provided A. T. C. training to 24 persons, basic communication officer\\'s training for 40 persons, and electronics maintenance training for 27 persons. Similarly, 78 persons were given fire control and life saving training and 41 persons received refresher training in fire control system. Thus, during the first four years of the plan, altogether 210 persons were provided training. Most of the work as envisaged under the civil aviation safety and information services project regarding installation and strengthening of flight information services were carried out in 20 airfields. During this period, economic and technical surveys were also carried out in various airports and airfields. Financial Targets and Progress The Sixth Plan had provided the financial outlay of Rs 780 million for various programmes and projects concerning air transport development. During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, a total of Rs 476.6 million was expended at the current market price and the estimated expenditure for the last year of the Plan 1984,185 was Rs 171.2 million; this makes the total expenditure of Rs 646.8 million at the current price for the entire plan period. During the Sixth Plan period, a number of problems were encountered while executing air transport development programmes which pushed the national priority projects like  and Nepalgunj airport project behind the schedule. Besides, the targets of terminal building construction, staff quarters and other works under various programmes could not be fulfilled. Some of the problems encountered were delay in construction work and tender processing, failure to deliver construction materials to site on time and delay in land acquisition for projects. Excessive delay in processing contract documents on the international terminal building of  has created a massive problem of price escalation. Moreover, a lot of construction projects are undertaken without detailed feasibility studies and on the basis of rough estimates of cost which results in various problems. Therefore, the programmes of the Seventh Plan are formulated keeping in mind the problems and constraints experienced so far. Classification of Airports Satisfactory progress has been made in the number of airports constructed in the country since 1950. It is apparent that these airports have varying degree of significance in terms of their location and services. Therefore, a classification of these airports is in order. The existing basic physical facilities and communication and navigational aids are not uniformly available in all the airports. The airports have been classified as outlined in the Sixth Plan into A, B, C and D category keeping in mind the priority of installing additional facilities in certain selected airports. Thus, the air ports in various categories are: A- Tribhuvan International Airport, ; B- Biratnagar, Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj; C- Bhadrapur, Janakpur, Simra, Meghauli and Dhangadi; and D- remaining all other airports and stol airfields. \\'A\\' category airport will be of international standard. \\'B\\' category airport will be constructed to suit A vro aircraft and will have at least 5000 feet runway. The \\'c\\' category airport will consist of grass runways and will have a minimum of 3000 feet length, while \\'D\\' category will be suitable for stol type aircraft with grass runways. The basic facilities required for the above airfields are presented in Table 5 below: Objectives, Policies and Programs of the Seventh Plan: Objectives The objectives of the air transport development will also be like that of roads transport development: to strengthen national integrity through linking various parts of Kingdom. In addition to this it will seek to promote tourism industries and foreign trade as well as facilitate air transport facilities to the mountain and remote districts of the country. Policies The following policies will be adopted to realize the above objectives: In order to make the objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan more effective and realistic, the following policies will be adopted. 1. More attention will be given to institute necessary structural reforms of  in order to enhance qualitative improvement in is services. Concrete steps will be taken to construct terminal complex and provide warehouse facilities. To ensure grater utilization of the airport, in other words to increase the number of flights, charter services will be encouraged from foreign companies and steps will be taken to attract more airlines. 1. National priority projects. 2. Repair and maintenance of airfields. 3. Expansion of additional physical facilities. 4. Communication and navigational aids. Physical Targets In consonance with the objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan, runway construction and strengthening will be done in 2 airports and a new international terminal building will be completed at . One Stol airfield will be constructed in one of the remote districts vital for tourism development. Programs Keeping in mind the stated basic objectives and policies for air- transport development, various projects have been proposed for implementation. a) Airport construction, expansion and strengthening; b) Expansion of additional physical facilities; c) Construction, expansion and strengthening of Stol airfields; d) Install communication equipment and navigational aids as well as fire control and life saving services and e) Miscellaneous: a) Construction, Expansion and Strengthening of Airports The airfields that have runways to service Avro and jet type medium and large aircraft in various of the country are designated airports and being constructed. Such airports will have concrete and grass runways on the basis of their importance from both national and international point of view. According to the classification, such airports will be categorized into \\'A\\', \\'B\\' and \\'C\\', under this program during the Seventh Plan, the backlog projects from the earlier of   ,   and  are proposed during the Plan period. i) The Oldest airport of  and the most important from both national and international point of view-  is placed in \\'A\\' category. It has runway 10,000 feet long and 150 wide and medium size jet aircraft can easily ply in this airport. It plays a significant role in the development and expansion of both tourism and international trade and various construction works are in progress. In view of the fact that until the completion of the international level terminal complex, the existing terminal building was to remain in use, expansion of the present terminal building was done during the Sixth Plan period to facilitate the growing number of passengers. Besides this, drilling was completed to resolve the persisting water supplies problem. A master plan was formulated for the systematic development of this national priority project and various construction works are in progress according to the master plan. The targets for Seventh Plan under this project regarding terminal complex construction are international terminal building, operation tower, airlines building, customs warehouse etc. and construction of domestic of domestic terminal building, fire rescue apron and related works. Under the additional physical facilities development program, essential repair works will be carried out in the existing international building and civil maintenance yard, water distribution works, western locator building and so on will be constructed. Similarly, the target also includes equipment repair, maintenance and expansion works. ii) \\t Project Located in the terai region of Bheri zone, Nepalgunj airport is an important aerodrome in the Mid and Far0-Western Development Regions. This airport was being used as a base area to operate economic and reliable air services to the Stol airfields in the mountain and remote districts of the Mid and Far- Western regions since the Fourth Plan period. Keeping this in mind and also the fact that the old Nepalgunj airport was not technically suitable, a new airp ort with concrete runway was constructed in Manikpur in north south portion of Nepalgunj-Surkhet road. As the runway of this airport extends 5000 feet avro level aircraft can be operated here. Air services were begun in the new airport from Sixth Plan period. However, various construction works remain to be carried out on this national priority in order to develop it as a base airport for Mid and Far Western Development region. During the Seventh Plan period, the lapses found in the runway constructed at t he Sixth Plan period will be removed and reconstructed along with necessary reforms. The construction works at air port site will include parallel taxi area, expansion of apron, cross fire roads, senderages system and so on. In physical facilities expansion the remaining works of the terminal building will be undertaken and car parking, water supply system, staff quarters passenger parapet and civil maintenance yard will be constructed. As part of communication and navigational aids expansion, electricity supplies are being done to the airport areas and various building and essential equipment will be installed. Expansion of Additional Physical Facilities Since the dawn of development process in  it was realized that there was no viable alternative to air transport to provide immediate transportation link to remote and hilly districts and same other areas and therefore priority was given for the development of these sector. The economize resources and time, emphasis was given only to construct airfields in various parts of the country so to initiate air services as soon as possible. Hence the existing physical facilities at various airports are inadequate at present to provide regular and more reliable air services. Therefore, the policy was adopted to provide gradually the basic physical facilities at various airports and Stol airfields in different parts of the country as per airport classification. The physical facilities at the airports will be improved in the light of the importance of airport, numb er of flights, and passengers and so on. Additional physical facilities include construction and expansion of terminal building, staff quarters, generator house, sewerage system, entry way, water supply system, removal of obstruction facing the runways and other constructions pertaining to airport safety. During the Seventh Plan Period, additional physical facilities will be added in eighth airports and 17 Stol airfields. They are as follows: The targets for providing additional physical facilities in various airports during the plan period are: 1) To complete water supply system and security guards house in Chandragadi airport (Jhapa); 2) To complete construction work of staff quarters, workshop building, fire control station, cross roads, and water supply system in Biratnagar;; 3) To complete staff quarters construction and water supply system in Tumlingtar airport; 4) To complete the fire control station and water supply system in Simara airport (Bara); 5) To carryout construction of the fire vansheds water tanks and fencing in Pokhara airport; 6) To carry out construction and expansion of terminal building, staff quarters, sewerage system, etc. in Surkhet airport; 7) To carry out works related to entry way and culverts, warehouses staff quarters and water supply system in Dhangadi airport (Kailali); and 8) To construct terminal building, concrete sewerage and entry way, and staff quarters in Mahendranagar (Kanchanpur) airport. Concerning the stol airfields, the expansion of additional facilities envisaged are: 1) To reconstruct terminal building, install drainage system and river control works, water supply system, guards house and entry way in Gokuleshwar (Darchula) airfield. 2) To improve runway gradients, install concrete drainage system, construct guards house, water supply system and fencing works in Baitadi airfield; 3) To construct staff quarters, water supply system, retaining wall and guards those in Bajura (Kunakathi) airfield; 4) To construct drainage system, guards house and water supply system in Bajhang airfield; 5) To reconstruct and expand terminal building, construct staff quarters, guards house and water supply system in Jumla airfield; 6) To construct concrete drainage, fencing and guards house Chaurjahari (Rukum) airfield; 7) To install water supply system, staff quarters, apron and drainage and water supplies works in Simikot (Humla) airfield; 9) To construct staff quarters, guards house and water supplies system in Balewa (Baglung) airfield, 10) To expand terminal building, construct security guards and guards-house and remove a hillock facing the runway Jomson airfield; 11) To expand terminal building, construction staff quarters, initiate landslide control and removal of obstruction facing the runway and inestay water supply system in Taplejung airfield; 12) To construct staff and security guards quarters, entry way, drainage and water supply system in Bhojpur airfield; 13) To construct staff quarters, water distribution system and landslide control in Lamidanda (Khotang) airfield, 15) To construct terminal building, staff and security guards quarters and water supply system in Ramjatar airfield; and 16) To construct terminal building, security guards and staff quarters, landslide and water supply system in Akashe (Ramechhap) airfield. C. Construction, Expansion and Strengthening of Stol Airfields In view of the fact a lot of time and capital will be required to provide road transportation inn most of the mountainous and hilly districts of the Kingdom, the policy was adopted to construct stol airfields in such areas to facilitate modern transportation link and bolster development works and various programs were being executed from the early stage of development efforts. As the construction for stol airfield was guided by this policy, air services have been provided in most of the mountainous and most remote areas as well. The airfields constructed some years ago in the remote districts require various improvements and if the airfields designed for pilots porter aircraft could be expanded for use by Twin Otter type airplanes, it could ensure greater economic benefits; from the Sixth Plan onwards, the policy has been adopted to expand suitable stol airfields in order to facilitate services of Twin Otter aircraft also. This policy has been adopted for the Seventh Plan also and programs are formulated accordingly. During the Seventh Plan period under the airfield expansion program runway expansion will be undertaken in three stole airfields including Phaplu airfield. In addition to this the targets are to construct water distribution system, river control works and guard house construction at Sanphe Bagar airfield; to construct terminal building, security guard and staff quarters and improve entry way at Syangboche airfield; and construct terminal building, security guard house, landslide control and water supply works at Phaplu stol airfield. To construct new stol airfield, feasibility study will be conducted at Talwa of Mugu, a remote region with great tourist attraction and a twin otter level air field will be set up there if found suitable. At the Doti stol airfield (Dipayal), the headquarters of the Far Western Development Region, the targets are to improve runway, expand terminal building, construct staff and security guard quarters, entry way, concrete drainage, water supply system and fencing. D. Communication and Navigational Aids, Fire Control and Life Saving Services To make air services more dependable and regular airfields should have not only physical facilities but also communication and navigational aids. As these facilities are required under the convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization also, communications and navigational aids are being installed in various airports and airfields from the past periodic plans. This has greatly helped to make air services regular and more reliable. Improved communication and navigational aids have made night services possible at Tribhuvan airport. T.R.C. and approach light equipment were installed in Bhairahawa and Biratnagar airports during the Sixth Plan period. Similarly, HF/UHF, net equipment and NDB communication equipment were installed Dhangadhi airport. In STOL airfields, HF, UHF, met equipment, NDB and PA communications equipment were installed in Tumlingtar, Lamidanda and Rukum airfields. HF, met equipment, PAPA equipment have been installed in Bhojpur, Baglung and Jomsom airfields. At Lukla, Dolpa and Dang airfields the equipment installed HF, UHF and met equipment. Jumla and Sanphe Bagar airfields are equipped with HF, UHF and communication aids. Dipayal (Doti) and Bajhang airfields are equipped with UHF, HF met equipment and PAPA aids while Humla and Ropla airfields are equipped with HF and UHF aids. However, such services are yet to be developed and expanded in various airports and airfields of the country and the Seventh Plan has also incorporated such programs. Under the communication and navigational aids programs, the targets for Tribhuvan International Airport are re-installation of NDB equipment; install solar power facilities to operate Phulchoki UHF repeater station and protection work against lightening; make FTN system fully operational; establish two way microwave radio system; and operate H.F.I.S.B. system. The targets for Biratnagar airport are reinstallation of FFTH system and NDB, set up HF cell call and teleprinter equipment. In Simara airport, NDB will be re-established and HF cell call, FFTN system will install. In additional to this, repair and maintenance will be carried out to equipment being used in various airports and airfields. Under the fire control and life saving services, Tribhuvan International airport, Nepalgunj, Pokhara, Simara, Janakpur Biratnagar and Bhairahawa airport will be equipped with foam tender, water tender, fire engine for fire control and ambulance vehicles will be acquired on the basis of relevant studies. E. Miscellaneous Various project of air port development are included under this heading. There are: 1) Airport equipment; 2) Civil aviation training, 3) Flight safety and Information services and 4) Fiscal and Technical studies. 1. Projects on Acquiring Airport Equipment This project initiated during the Sixth Plan will improve and strengthen the quality of services from various airports. During the Seventh Plan period, Bajura, Sanphebagar, Baitadi, Jumla, Taplejung and Syangboche airfields will receive six sets of solar powered communication equipment Nepalgunj and Biratnagar airports will be equipped with two sets VDF equipment; Tribhuvan International airport and Nepalgunj airport will be fitted with airport electrification equipment, 37 sets of accident investigation instruments, 25 sets of various test equipment and customs detection equipment will also be acquired for Tribhuvan airport customs. 2. Civil This training center was created to produce middle and low level technical manpower required for air transport development within the country. Various training courses are being provided by this center related to civil aviation. During the Seventh Plan also, this center will concentrate in producing middle and lower level technical manpower. In consonance with the policies and objective of air transport development, studies will be conducted concerning the direction for the development of this center. Necessary steps will be taken based on the finding of the study. 3. Financial and Technical Study Project Feasibility studies for air transport development will be continued during the Seventh Plan period also. Pre -feasibility study will be conducted to upgrade Dhangadhi airport in the Far Western Development Region and to expand and strengthen Surkhet airport in the Far Western Development Region and to expand and strengthen Surkhet airport and to development alternate international airport. In the hilly districts, feasibility study will be conducted to construct stol airfields and introduce balloon services. Statistics concerning air transport development will be collected and potential for service expansion will be explored. 4. Flight Safety and Information Services Projects Under this project, necessary arra ngements will be made to ensure flight security and safety. Both domestic and international flight information services will be studied and reforms will be initiated During the Seventh Plan period, a total of Rs 893 million has been allocated for various programs and project related to air transport development. The details are as follows: Royal Nepal airlines Corporation Background The Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation began domestic air services in 1959 and has completed 26 years of cont inuous services. In view of the geographical situation of the country air transport was given special emphasis from the national integration viewpoint as the development of other means of transportation requires more time and resources and there were no alternative system of surface transport development in the country. As a result air transport services were gradually expanded in the country and at present the RNAC provides scheduled air services to 36 different airfields. The RNAC now has 10 Twin Otter aircraft, 3 Avro aircraft and 2 pilatus porter planes for the domestic services and two jet aircraft for external services; and one additional jet aircraft is being operated on lease to expand regional services. Additional aircraft and facilities will be added to ensure more regular and systematic air services as outlined in the policies of the Seventh Plan. Progress Review of the Sixth Plan During the Sixth Plan, to realize the objectives of gradual improvement in the air services of the RNAC the targets fixed were to purchased additional aircraft, install ground handling equipment and communication aids, and set up maintenance workshop. In view of the increased operations at the  of the RNAC and other airlines companies various ground handling equipment were acquired and put to service under the additional equipment installation program. In spite of some delay in setting up maintenance workshops in  and Nepalgunj airports, the progress made was satisfactory. During the Sixth Plan period, the RANAC continued to expand its air services and Rolpa, Manang and Bajura were added in the domestic scheduled flights. Currently air services are extended to 37 airfields with in Kingdom. In the external operations, 10 destinations in nine countries- , , , , , , ,  and  are provided direct air links which has contributed to expand \\'s external trade and enhance international goodwill. The following table reveals table a substantial improvement in the annual passenger and cargo handling of the RNAC during the Sixth Plan period compared to the last year of Fifth Plan. Policies to be adopted During the Seventh Plan 1. In view of he achievements made by the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation in air transport development to dat3e, the policy will be adopted to make the scheduled servic3es more regular and systematic and the current fleet of old aircraft will re gradually phased out introducing new aircraft. 2. To make the domestic air services more effective in regional terms , major airports in country with greater physical facilities will be used as regional are for improved air services in other airfields in the region. In this context, the RNAC will actively engage in programs to develop Nepalgunj airport as a regional air service base in order to expand air services in the Mid-West and Far-Western Regions which have relatively under developed transportation network. 3. In view of the additional investment needed to acquire new aircraft to improve and expand both international domestic services by the RNAC, realistic approach will be taken while fixing air transport fares in order to return suitable returns on the prior investment. Programs of the Seventh Plan As outlined in the policies and program of the air transport development of the Seventh Plan, RNAC will conduct the following programs: 1. Aircraft Purchase Program To enhance rapidly growing tourism industry and boost foreign exchange earnings from tourism sector, the existing fleet of aircraft with the RNAC were felt inadequate to expand, strengthen and regularly organize both international and domestic air services. Therefore, during the Seventh Plan period necessary aircraft will be acquired guided by the report of the fleet evaluation constituted by His Majesty\\'s Government. 2. Establishment of Regional Services ad  in Nepalgunj As Western Development Regional of the Kingdom remain under developed and inaccessible from transportation point of view and a long time and huge resources will be required to develop to surface transport system, air transport development has been emphasized for those regions. Currently, the RNAC is operating air services in 15 airfields of the Mid-West and Far-Western Development Regions. The RNAC has initiated a new system of transporting passengers and cargo goods to Nepalgunj from  on large aircraft as the remote airfields are far away from the capital and then operate stol aircraft from Nepalgunj to small airfields as part of north-south regional air-service network. 3. Maintenance Workshop and Training A workshop will be established in  to maintain and repair aircraft and other equipment In addition to this, training will be provided to RNAC personnel to enhance their efficiency. POSTAL SERVICE In the initial stage, postal service was limited within simple transportation of mail-letters. Post officers are now involved in money order and other economic service such as savings banking, etc. These service have contributed in the support of economic, social and trade sectors of the economy. Postal service started in 1878 A. D. in . There were forty three postal office in three years from it s inception. Extensive expansion of postal service started in 1956, only a fter the advent of planned development. At the beginning of the First Plan, i.e., 1956/57, there were 124 post office. N.B. Regional balance could be observed in establishment of post office in accordance with the policy of regional balance in the expansion of post office. 1979/85 respectively. In order to extend the access of more people to postal services, attention has been accorded to increase the number of post offices since earlier plans. This has brought about favorable proportion of such offices to population. Before the advent of planned development in 1956/57 there has one post office for every 68,548 population. At the end of the Third Plan, there was one post office for every 15,643 population. By the end of the Fifth Plan in 1979.80, there was one post office for 10530 population. It stood at one post office for every 9,238 population in 1983.84 the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan. Considering the progress in the first four years of the Plan the physical target inn postal development are likely to be activated in the Sixth Plan period. Against the target of establishing 480 post offices, including 80 sub-post offices and 400 additional post offices were completed, including 81 sub-post office and 320 additional post offices. In view of the expected achievement in the establishment of 30 sub-post offices and 40 additional post offices in 1984/85- the last year of the Sixth Plan, 471 post offices, which makes 98.00 percent of planned target, are expected to be established with in Sixth Plan period. As part of support for mail delivery four delivery vans, four scooter vans and 650 cycles were procured in the first four years of the Plan period against the target of six mail vans, 11 mail scooter vans and 500 cycles for mailmen respectively. It is expected that 100 cycles will be procured to the final year. Regarding construction and expansion programs of post office buildings 85 buildings (75.89 percent) buildings are completed in the first four years of the Plan against the target of constructing 112 buildings. In view of the expected construction of 23 such units, it is expected that 108 buildings would have been constructed by the end of the Plan period thus making 96.43 percent in achievement of planned target. New construction of eleven post office buildings, expansion of 10 postal offices buildings, 45 aid -buildings and 19 carry-over building projects from the Fifth Plan have been completed in the first four years of the Sixth Plan. Regarding economic services, the Sixth Plan envisaged money order services through 100 post offices, saving banking services through 50 post offices and cash on delivery through 14 post offices. Against the target of extending postal training to 600 postal employees under miscellaneous programs, 480 persons received training in the first four years of the Plan period. In view of expected training of 120 persons in 1984/85, the planned target in postal training is expected to be achieved in the Sixth Plan period. The targets of establishing additional 2500 post boxes and 1500 mail boxes under the postal strengthening project are likely to achieved. But the establishment of central postrage stams emporium is not likely to be completed. While the Sixth Plan envisaged the target of extending p ostal service at the rate of one post office for every 8,711 population, it is likely that there will be one post office per 8,987 population by 1984/85, the end of the Plan period. Presently, there is one post office per 8,926 population by the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, i.e. 1983/84. Against the target of availing of postal service at the rate of one post office per 77.83 square kilometer on average, one post office per 80.82 square kilometre has been accomplished by 1983/84. Financial Achievement: The sixth Plan envisaged a total expenditure of Rs 30 million in different programs for post services development. Out of this, an expenditure of Rs 20.267 million at market price has been actually incurred at the end of 1983/84. Details of expenditures according to programs and years is given below: Problems in the implementation of various projects in postal services are mainly related i) delays in creating staffs positions and land acquisition, ii) the necessity to make repeated tend3er calls, and iii) frequent incidence of contractors, leaving construction works incomplete. Objectives, Policies and Programs of the Seventh Plan: The basic objective of postal services in the Seventh Plan is to render postal services efficient and reliable with regional balance. The efforts will have to be directed at helping support development process by extending to village levels traditional ordinary and registered mail services as well as different economic services related to general peoples. Policies The following policies will be pursued in order to achieve various objectives related to the development of postal services: 1. Special emphasis will be given to qualitative improvement in postal services with increased confidentiality and regularity. Postal units will be increased in order to improve the ratio between post offices and population. The aim it to establish at least one postal unit in every \\'Ilaka\\' (region) of all districts. Establishment of post office will be done on the basis of regional balance. The followings are the working policies to be adopted in order to achieve aforementioned objective implementation of related policies: 1. More attention will be given to better management of public post offices and semi-government additional post offices. Additionally arrangement for commission agents will be made easy availability of postal stamps especially in rural areas with inadequate services available in the post offices. Physical Target In order to fulfil special objectives, the Seventh Plan has envisaged the establishment of 649 post offices, consisting of 175 sub post offices and 474 additional post offices. It is expected that the total number of post offices will increase to 2,540 in 1989/90 units from the level of 1981 units in 1984/85 the last year of the Sixth Plan. There would be one post office in every 57.95 square kilometer area. Postal Development Program In view of existing ration between the population and post offices, it is essential to bring about improvement in the quantitative situation of post offices. Thus, the following projects will be implement to establish public and semi-public post offices. 1. Sub-post Office: Sub post office comes nest to district post office among public post offices. The sub post office is involved in the transportation of mail between district and additional post offices as well as sale and distribution of postal stamps, envelopes, airogramme ad other postal goods in the process of registration and delivery of mail. Additional post offices receive stamps through it. It offers internal money order service. These district post offices are established on the basis of nine \\'Ilakas\\' (regions) of the district and the extra workloads in different places. Generally, additional post offices are upgraded to sub post offices. It is estimated that there would be 397 sub post offices established by 1984/85 the last year of the Sixth Plan. It is envisaged that 175 sub-post offices will be established additionally during the Seventh Plan period. Thus it is expected that there would be 572 sub post offices by the end of the Seventh Plan period, i.e. 1989/90. They would be established on the basis of Development of Regions with 35, 35, 35, 35, 45 and 25 units in the Eastern Region, Central Region, Western Region, Mid-western Region, and Far-western Region respectively. 2. Additional Post Office Additional post office is the lowest level post office and is operated on semi-public basis. An additional post office consists of one agent and one delivery agent as well as a carrying agent according to need. Generally it covers 6,000 population within one mile of its distance in mail transportation and distribution. Additionally, such an additional post office offers sale of stamp aero grammes, money order, carrying insurance order and registration of mail. It is generally operated on the basis of peoples\\' participation and is open for two top three hours a day. It is envisaged that 474 additional post offices would be established during the Seventh Plan period. As a consequence, the number of additional post offices in the country would reach 1863 by 1989/90 in the country. b) Expansion and improvement of mail delivery: Improvement and expansion of mail delivery routes, serving as postal lines, and the related means for transportation are important for fast delivery of mail. Included under this program are: i) \\texpansion of postal lines and ii) the system for the means for mail delivery. 1. Expansion of postal lines Postal lines are the route postmen use for the delivery of mail. It is essential that they are short and direct routes. Existing direct route across villages, districts and zones will be used for postal lines for fast mail delivery. There are 62 postal lines in various parts of the country, especially, in the hills and mountain areas. Altogether, twenty four postal lines were added during the first four years of the Sixth Plan, making altogether 86 postal lines by 1984/85. It is envisaged that 30 additional postal lines will be established, with 6 postal lines in each Development Region during the Seventh Plan Period. 2. Mail delivery system: Postmen a re allowed bicycles within town and village Panchayats. Besides this, mail vans and scooters are also used for efficient distribution and necessary supervision of mail. Therefore, it is envisaged that there will be expanded us of bicycles, scooters and vans in the distribution of mail during the Seventh Plan too. C) Construction of new post office buildings: The majority of post offices in  do not have their own buildings. About 80 percent of post offices are housed in rented buildings for their daily work. Because rented houses are normally not suitable for post offices, policy has adopted to let post offices have their own buildings gradually. Improvement in facilities of post office buildings has been possible because of this. Arrangement of counters, sorting halls, store and office rooms is made in newly constructed post office buildings. Post office buildings to be constructed during the Seventh Plan period also follow suit. The follow projects will be undertaken in this respect. i) \\tConstruction of new post office buildings: It is envisaged that additional twelve post offices will have their own buildings completed during the Seventh Plan period. Among them are two units in Eastern Region, there in Central Region, two in Western Region, three in Mid-western and two in Far-western Region. ii) \\tOngoing construction of post offices: Plan come under this. Regarding this, it is envisaged that twelve incomplete post office buildings will be completed during the Seventh Plan period. Among there are on in Eastern Region, two in Central Region, three in Western Region, two in Mid -western Region and four in Far-western Region. iii) \\tExpansion of post office buildings: Expansion of post office buildings in view of expanding services and workload as well as increasing number of staff has started since the inception of planned development. This will be continued during the Seventh Plan too. During this Plan period it is envisaged that addition of stories, room etc. will be completed in ten post offices in different districts in the country. Two post office buildings will be expanded in each development region. iv) \\tPost office building construction with contribution In view of the need to bring about large increase in the construction of post office buildings at the people\\'s level\\'s with some subsidy (contribution) from the government. Altogether such construction work in 35 post offices have been completed by the end of the four years of the Plan period. Thus, because the progress achieved in this field with people\\'s participation has been encouraging, construction of post office building with supplementary government contribution is incorporated in the Seventh Plan too with the objective of constructing additionally such post office buildings. There will be ten in Eastern Region, twelve in Central Region, ten in Western Region, nine in Mid -western Region and nine in Far-western Region a. Economic Services Postal services have not been limited with simple transportation and distribution of letters and goods but have also included economic services such as money order and savings bank that render direct assistance to national development. These economic services are mainly limited to district headquarters and business centers. Presently, these services are available only through district post offices and some sub-post offices. Therefore, i) Money Order Service and ii) Savings Deposit Service are included under economic services in the Seventh Plan. 1. Money Order Services: Money order service plays an important role in a country like  with large population in lower and medium-level-income groups and limited banking facilities. Therefore, this service has been continued since the Fifth Plan to facilitate transfer of small amounts of money through post offices from one district to another for the general people. There is an arrangement for the transfer of up to one thousand rupees between  and  and across different districts of the country. This service was available in 63 district post offices during the Fifth Plan period and, additionally 109 district post offices provided this service by the end of the four years of the Sixth Plan. In view of the money ord er service operating with neighboring country, , there is the need to expand internal money order service to more places. But, considering the geographical situation and limited resources and manpower, it is but natural that it should take still some time to extend this service to rural areas in the country. The objective is to extend this service to rural areas without banking facilities although it is presently limited mostly in district headquarters. It is envisaged that money order service will be made available additionally through public post offices of which there will be 30, 30, 35, 40 and 15 in Eastern Region, Central Region, Western Region, Mid-western Region, Mid -western Region and Far-western Region respectively 2. Postal Savings Bank Service: This service, offered by the post office, has an important role in inculcating the habit of saving on the part of people in lower level income groups. Postal savings bank service is very useful service, particularly for the general people in making small savings. Under this service, the minimum deposit accepted is Rs 5 and the maximum at Rs 30,000. Interest offered is as the one offered by other banks. Started during the Fifth Plan period, this service is gradually extended to different districts of the country. This service will be expanded during the Seventh Plan too. e) Miscellaneous: Several other factors are important for the development of postal services. The upgrading of the standard of training of postal staff, use of modern equipment and improvement in the collection and distribution of mail have important roles in increasing the efficiency of postal staff. Therefore, projects related to i) postal training management, ii) postal strengthening iii) establishment of the sorting center and iv) postal master plan have been included in the Seventh Plan. 1. Postal training management: Postal training management project has been implemented with a view to improve the efficiency to postal staff. Indeed, the qualitative improvement of postal serv ice depends on this kind training activities. This center has been involved in the training of staff of non-official level. This Seventh Plan has envisaged the training of officer-level staff too through this center in various fields and the training of 750 staff during the Plan period. 2. Strengthening of the postal system: There has been significant quantitative increase in the development of postal service in . However, in view of the limitations in the physical facilities of most of the existing post offices, there is the need for the project, strengthening the postal system. Capital and non -durable goods are regularly required for the efficient functioning of the postal service. Therefore, institutional reforms regarding Central Stamps Emporium, Stock ledger/Central Money order office, etc., together with essential supplies of capital goods and non-durable goods such as lac, jute thread and sealing stamper are envisaged in the Seventh Plan. Besides these, strengthening of the Central Post Office on the basis of mechanized technology will be also undertaken. 3. Establishment of the sorting center Arrangement of the sorting of mail at the proper place enables economical and fast distribution of mail. A sorting center will be established during the Seventh Plan period in Chitawan district as this district stands at the central po int for surface mail delivery in the country. 4. Study and formulation of the Master Plan Studies for the qualitative improvement and planned development of postal service will be continued in the Seventh Plan too. Beside this, formulation of a master plan for the postal service is also envisaged. Financial Investment: The following table shows investment in various programs under postal service. CHAPTER 32 Background Prospects for overall economic development will be brighter only if the present structure of the economy, with predominate dependenc3e on traditional agriculture, can be gradually transformed through the process of industrialization. A desired rate of growth can only be maintained in the national economy only if different economic activities can be expanded and diversified as sustenance of desired rate of growth can only be maintained in the national economy only if different economic activities can be expanded and diversified as sustenance of desired rate of growth is not possible through increase in agricultural production dependent on limited arable land. On the one hand, the impact of past development endeavors on the growing population has been limited whereas, on the oth4re hand, it has not been possible to accelerate, in pace with growing expectations, the process of development through industrialization. The size and growth of the economy will always be limited and efforts to strengthen the economy through increase investment will yield only marginal results. Delays in the expansion of transport networks and power generation and distribution system, limited size of internal market and the landlocked situation of the country still continue to act as the major impediments in industrial development. Supply of raw-material for expansion of industrial development has been hindered mainly by the lack of significant increase in agricultural production, decreasing forestry products and by the lack of development and commercial promotion of production of mines and quarries. The balance of payments situation shows signs of worsening every year mainly because goods and construction materials have to be imported in increasing volume even at higher prices to sustain the pace of development whereas, the other hand, Nepalese exports have, by and large, stagnated over the year because of their relative costs. This situation calls for sustained efforts on industrial development only through which the economy can be self-sufficient in production of different commodities and thus substitute imports and for efforts to reduce production and transit cost to significantly boost exports. Deposit the significant role that the private sector can play in the process of industrial development, it has to be accepted that the potentials of the private sector in establishment and operation of large industries has not been encouraging. This trend has a limiting effect on the process of industrialization, which still has to depend on the government sector only. Recent indications show that investments of the private sector has somewhat shifted towards industrial ventures from real estates and commerce. But, even th3en, this shift in investment seems to be concentrated in industries which promise very quick returns and which have a high propensity to use imported raw-materials. Industries of this type, while providing certain benefits in the short terms, seem to have had only limited role to play in terms of long-term contributions to the process of industrial development, signs of improvement in the process of industrialization can be attributed mainly to the increasing demands of industrial products in the country, extension and expansion of services from financial institutions, gradual expansion of the improvements in transport, power and other facilities, commodity development and to the efforts on skill and entrepreneur development. Caparison of the results of industrial censuses of 1976/77 and 1981/82 show that the member of industrial units increased from 3528 to 4903, an increase by 72.8 percent. Likewise, member of person employed has also increased by 64 percent, from 50, 120, to 81,050. The total value of the products of these industries has also increased from Rs 3940 million to Rs 5920 million. Review of the Sixth Plan Despite the goal to promote 168 industries, it seems that only 57 industries have been promoted even if the estimated for fiscal year 1984/85 is taken into consideration. The goal to establish mineral-based industries under joint-investment program has not yielded any result. Likewise, hand-over of public sector industries to the private sector has lagged behind. The contribution of the industrial sector to the gross domestic product still does not show a consistent increase (annex 1). The contribution of this sector to gross domestic product still hovers around 43 percent, as was the case in fiscal year 1979/80. Capacity utilization of the public sector industries, during the period 1980/81 to 1984/85, show an increasing trend. The average capacity utilization has increased from 56.6 percent in 1980/81 to 66.55 percent in 1984/85. Capacity utilization of Hetauda Textile Factory has increased from 28.75 percent to 68 percent, Janakpur Cigarette Factory from 58 percent to 90 percent, Birgunj Sugar Factory from 44.90 percent to 73.3 percent, Harisiddhi Brick and Tile Factory from 50.0 percent to 72.5 percent and the capacity utilization of Himal Cement Company increased from 70.7 percent to 83.3 percent. It seems unlikely that cement production will see significant increased during the Sixth Plan period because: i) Hetauda Cement Factory, which is under construction will produce in small quantities as it is still under trial production, ii) there have been long delays in expansion of production capacity of Himal Cement Factory and iii) there has been hardly any progress in matters relating to establishment of Udayapur Cement Factory. However, there are strong indicators to suggest that the country is approaching total self-sufficiency in the production of goods and commodities like biscuit, confectionery, laundry soap, vegetable ghee, wheat-flour, polythene pope, cigarette, matches, rubber slipper, noodles, beers, soft-beverages, alcoholic beverages, sugar, currugated-sheet and paints. Dependence on imports for writing and printing papers still does not show any signs of change. Regarding production of paper, Bhrikuti Paper Factory is not likely to come into production and even the construction works of the Nepalgunj paper Mill has not yet started. Hence, there is not likelihood of increase in paper production during the plan period. It is, moreover, likely that the country will have to depend, still to some extent, on import of sugar as the progress on the establishment of a sugar mill in the government sector has not crossed preliminary stage. Implementation of Industrial Enterprise Act, 1981; Foreign Investment and Technology Act, 1982 and the promulgation of 1983 ordinance show signs that the process of industrial development can be organized and directed towards set goals and objectives. The solidarity Ministerial Conference and he Investment Promotion Conference organized during the plan period have made significant contributions to create an environment conductive to the promotion of foreign investments. Progress achieved by N.I.D.C., the only institution involved in extending loans to the private sector for industrial investment, is also not that encouraging. During the Sixth Plan period it was estimated that this corporation will be extend financial assistance to the private sector to the tune of Rs 502.7 million where as corporation has invested only Rs 204.3 million during the period covering 1980/81 to 1983/84. Short-fall in loan investment during the first four years with yearly investment amounting on an average to only Rs 51 million or 40.6 percent of the targeted amount has been the main reason for this rather unsatisfactory performance. The fact that implementation of Industrial Enterprises Act, 2038, implementation of the new trade policy introduced in 2039 to promote industrial development and the promulgation of the ordinance of 2040 contributed significantly in boosting-up the export of goods and commodities like leather, carpet and ready-made garments is born out by the increase in export of manufactured goods experience in fiscal years 1983/84 and 1984/85. In the same way, Agricultural Lime Industry was estimated to produce 10 thousand tons of agricultural lime, 55 thousand tons of chemical lime -stone and 9 thousand tons of miscellaneous construction materials but it has produced an estimated 2.3 thousand metric tons of agricultural lime, 28.4 thousand metric tons of chemical lime -stones and 5.2 metric tons of miscellaneous construction materials. Regarding projects under construction and/or under expansion, works on increasing the production capacity of Himal Cement Factory from 160 metric tons to 400 metric tons daily are still under-way. Delays in completing the construction of Hetauda Cement Factory which has a production capacity of 750 metric tons per day suggest that the Factory will not be able to produce cement commercially during the plan period through it undertake traial-production in the last four-months of fiscal year 1984/85. On the development of industrial raw-materials, Tobacco Development Company was to produce 18 thousand metric tons of tobacco through its extension and promotion services and the Cotton Development Board was to produce 2.3 thousand metric tons of cotton and 5.4 metric tons of cotton-seed under its extension and promotion program and cultivation of cotton was to be undertaken in 7.8 thousand hectares. Signs of positive changes are indicated in the process of industrial development, in utilization of production, capacity employment generation and in exports during the Sixth Plan period. However, intensified efforts are needed to further consolidate the effects of these positive changes to the economy as a whole. The need to focus due attention and to develop and following aspects are very cogent: 1. Management, on a well-coordinated and timely basis of delivery of facilities and services provided to entrepreneurs for industrial development by different acts and regulations has not been effectively developed. 2. Efforts to increase productivity of raw-materials produced with in the country, ensure adequate and timely supply of imported raw-materials, provide necessary loans, foreign exchange and other financial assistance and increase the productivity of local labour have not resulted in success to the desire extent. 3. There has been hardly any success in increasing the size of the limited internal market through development of agricultural sector which could increase the income of the majority of population engaged in agriculture. 4. Transport and power facilities, which could provide an added impetus to the process of industrialization, have not been developed in different parts (especially in central and other mountainous) of the country. 5. There have been no concrete result of efforts to simplify and make more economic the cumbersome and costly system of transit. 6. Effective measure have not been developed to protect industries from the competing with goods that flow in the country because of the open border. 7. Development of manpower, expertise and management capabilities have not yet been undertaken in a planned manner. Though there were indications of positive change in the last tow years of the plan period, mainly because of implementation and promulgation of certain acts and ordinance, it is not likely that an atmosphere congenial to the healthy growth of industrialization process can be effected without bringing-in significant changes inn the points mentioned above. In addition to these measures that had to be taken at the government level, the Sixth Plan had also accorded priority to the need to expand the role of the private sector in industrial development. Financial institutions have cordial role to play in expanding the involvement of the private sector in industrial development. But N.I.D.C which was established with the basic object of extending assistance in the establishment of medium and large-scale industries, has bot been able to achieve desired results. However, it has to be admitted that there has been no increase in the capital base of N.I.D.C. commensurate to the needs brought about by the increased attraction of the private sector to industrial ventures and by the increase in project size and outlays Increase in production of agricultural, forestry and mineral sectors is essential to establish industrial sector as the leading sector of the economy. Growth in these sectors will lead to an improvement in the purchasing capacity of the mass and it is the increase in the purchasing power of the mass that leads to an increase in the demand for industrial products and in the production of raw materials. Thus, increase in production from agricultural and other sectors are the pre-requisites without which there can be no industrial development. The fact that a balanced and well-coordinated development of other productive sectors of the economy will greatly facilitate the development of industrial sector is yet to be translated into meaningful practice. The following objectives, policies and programs have been identified and developed, on the basis of the achievements and experiences of the Sixth Plan, for implementation in the Seventh plan. Objective 1. From among the non-agricultural sectors, to increase the contribution of the industrial sector to gross domestic production. 2. To expand and expansion and development of cottage industry as a means to increase productive employment opportunities. 4. To increase both the production and productivity of certain industrial products to promote exports and to substitute imports. Policy 1. Industries which have a direct linkage with domestically produced raw-materials and which can contribute positively to the gross domestic productive will be promoted and optimum utilization of production capacity of already established industries will be stressed. 2. System of incentives and other related provisions related to the increased participation of individual entrepreneurs and to attract foreign investments will be reviewed on a regular basis to incorporate necessary changes, if needed. 3. Industrial estates presently run in the government sector will gradually be handed-over to the private sector. 4. Priority will be accorded to promote industries, except for those related to defense production, in the private sector. 5. Necessary protection, but no monopoly rights, will be granted to industries involved in production of goods substitution imports used in daily consumption and of construction materials. Working Policy 1. A long-term plan for the development of industrial sector will be formulated and implemented in coordination with the sectoral needs and priorities of other sectors such as agriculture, forest and mining to main overall sectoral consistency and complimentary. 2. Necessary improvements in areas such as strengthening, management and financial resources will be undertaken to facilitate capacity utilization and to achieve greater productivity in industries both in the private and public sectors. 3. Internal competition and other appropriate measure will be undertaken to discourage monopoly practiced which generally affect the consumer adverse. 4. Programs directed as productions of goods to meet the basic needs of the people such as food grains, clothes, construction materials, medicine, teaching materials and at production of small agricultural tools and implements and both small machines to be used in factories to substitute import and to direct the economy towards self-sufficiency will be implemented on a priority basis. 5. The policy to create employment opportunities through expansion of industries will be followed and implemented. Necessary training will be provided to improve the qualitative standard and productivity of the extent layout force. 6. Industries which can substitute imports and this contribute towards self-sufficiency of the economy in the first two and the last three years of Seventh Plan will be identified and promoted on a priority basis. 7. Conforming to the priorities already stated, a list of industries to be promoted in the private sector and their promotion program will be developed. If the private sector does not come forward to the desired extent, as has been the case in the past, then efforts will be made to promote highly essential industries from among those in the priority list either directly in the public sector or in collaboration with the private sector. But even then, an outlook to hand -over these industries to the private sector will be maintained. 8. Shares of industries which are operating well at present will be sold and distributed through  to develop industrial finance markets. Interest of the general public will thus be mobilized towards industrial financing and investment from the private sector gradually promoted. 9. Processes involved in issuing licenses, financial assistance and other services necessary for industrial promotion will be simplified and made less time-consuming and a one-window system will be developed. 10. The present policy and process of industrial financing, import customs and duties and valuation practices, price control policy, labor policy, sales tax and excise duty will all be reviewed to incorporate timely changes. On the basis of adaptability and economic justification, a system to encourage imports of latest appropriate techniques will also be developed. 12. Effort will be made to develop institutional mechanism in the private sector to mobilize and employ members of the national labor force in employment opportunities created in the private sector. Hence, efforts will be made to implement effective programs to ensure regular and adequate supply of these inputs after an evaluation of present institutional and private arrangements. 14. A detailed study on the capital base and resource needs of N.I.D.C. will be undertaken and appropriate steps, as suggested by the study, will be initiated. 15. Especial efforts will be made expand the market and promote exports of industrial products like noodles, soap, vegetable ghee, cigarette, polythene pipe and plastic goods which already show signs of meeting total internal demands. 17. To further intensify efforts on different activities such as industrial planning, promotion, research, consultancy services, engineering services, entrepreneur development and increase in productivity, Industrial Services Center will be strengthened and transformed to a high-level National Productivity Council so that these activities are run in a campaign-like basis. 18. The pace of implementation of Small Industry Development Project presently operating in Bagmati and Gandaki Zone will be further improved. Such programs will be implemented in other districts as well in addition to intensifying the implemented in other districts as well in addition to intensifying the implementation efforts of such components under integrated rural development projects. 19. To promote exports and to increase foreign-exchange earnings, productivity or following products of small and cottage industries will be raised in addition to their standardization i)  Woolen carpets ii)  Paper and metal handicrafts iii)  Ready-made garments iv) Leather and leather products. 20. To promote the development of cottage and small-scale industries, a policy will be followed to discourage the establishment of certain industries except at the level of small and cottage industries. 21. A system whereby information on licenses provided for new industrial ventures and their salient feathers and an up-to-date registration data can be published and provided to the general public and potential investors will be developed. 22. To further facilitate the process of handling-over the industries in the public sector to the private sector, a set of criteria guiding the handing over process will be changed to private ownership. 23. Shares and land -ownership of in dustrial estates presently operating will be sold to industries only. Participation of the private sector will be sought and encouraged in developing land and in construction of sheds - in view industrial estates. To this effect, new system of management of industrial estates will be developed. Program The following programs will be implemented in the government sector during the Seventh Plan period. 1.

Survey, Studies and Promotion Program a) : Established in 1974 to identify feasible industries and to provide industrial and professional consultancy services, this Center is expected to promote 113 industries, undertake 100 feasibility studies and study 34 industries, provide management services to 30 industrial establishments including some sick-industries, provide entrepreneurial training to 100 persons and management training to 600 persons, undertake 25 productivity evaluation and undertake 25 programs on information dissemination as productivity. b) Small Business promotion Project: This project is presently run with external assistance and the present bilateral arrangement terminates the project in July 1986. Thus, the project is expected to provide consultancy training to 3 persons, prepare 1reference manual, evaluate related projects in 4 districts and provide training to 22 persons on management and technical training to 9 persons during the first year of the plan. c) Industrial Data and Monitoring Project: This project will be implemented with a view to collect and provide timely and reliable data on industrial ventures evaluate and monitor the performance of industrial undertaking so as to control misuse of facilities and services and to undertake comprehensive studies on a planned way of industrial operating in the country. During the plan period, this project is expected to collect and provide detailed information and data on operating industrial in a timely and scientific way and gradually undertake publication of such data information and to evaluate and monitor, on a regular basis, the performance of industries which are operating under government licenses and which have received certain facilities and services. This Institute was established in 1976 to improve and maintain it at a high level the quality and to standardize the products of domestic industries. The institute, during the plan period, will undertake activities directed at standardization and standards promotion, implementation and inspection of specific standards, and at the construction and operation of laboratory. Thus, this institute will specify standards to 500 commodities, devise rules and regulations on standardization to guard the interests of the consumers, run training programs on skill development, provide technical and consultancy services, provide standards specification to 30 commodities and ensure adherence, and will inspect and analyze for exportable commodities. e) Leather Industries Coordination Unit: This unit will be established essential to identify and develop policies for the healthy growth of leather industries, engender a congenial atmosphere for their sustained development, develop skills and techniques, promote exports and to identify potential regional and sources of investment for the development of these industries. g) Industrial Management and Feasibility Study: Activities such as feasibility studies of 40 industries including 20 sick industrial management services and studies are proposed to be undertaken under this project during the Plan period. Expenditure: Following is the level of expenditure likely to be incurred in the implementation of the programs already mentioned. The proposed expenditure are for the programs to be undertaken in the government sector only. In addition to this level of expenditures, an investment outlay to the tune of Rs 4004 million will be required to promote the targeted number of 159 of which two are being proposed in the (public sector) industries to be promoted in the private sector. Out of this total outlay, and amount of Rs 2850.8 million has to be mobilized to met the capital needs of these industries An amount of Rs 700 million from N.I.D.C., Rs 1108 million from commercial banks and the rest of Rs 994.8 million is proposed to be invested from external agencies to meet this capital needs. Expected Progress and Achievements It is expected that 70 percent of the industries proposed under industrial promotion program (annex 5) will complete their establishment phase and be able to operate on a commercial basis. It is estimated that the capacity utilization of industries to be promoted and improvements in capacity utilization of industries presently operating will raise the overall capacity utilization of industries to 70 percent in the Seventh Plan period resulting in an increase by Rs 6980 million in the production of industrial goods in the last year of the plan year of the plan period. If gross domestic product continues to grow at the present rate in the Sixth Plan period and if the estimated rate of growth of 4.5 percent is attained in the Seventh Plan, then the contribution of the industrial sector to the gross domestic product will reach 6 percent in the last year of the plan. This will have positive effects on the balance of trade as well. It is estimated that exports will increase by Rs 3579 million if the estimated increase of Rs 6980 million in industrial production materializes. however, as increase in production of this order is likely to need an import component of Rs 3845 million, net increase in export is estimated as Rs 814 million and net substitution of imports at Rs2291. the level of bigger-scale industries, 28 foot-related, 14 clothes and garments, 10 housing and construction materials related, 10 education materials related and 15 light-engineering industries and 23 export-oriented industries to a total of 123 industries are expected to be promoted. Likewise, at the level of cottage and small- scale industries, a total of 7,500 industries are to be promoted. In addition to thes e, 36 industries at the bigger scale and 3500 production-related and 7500 service-related cottage and small-scale industries will also be promoted. Chapter - 33 COTTAGE INDUSTRY Taking into consideration the scarcity of capital, technology, skilled manpower and the limit ed internal market in addition to the lack of infrastructural and power facilities, it is not likely that reliance on only large and medium scale industries will lead to industrial development. On the other hand, development of cottage industry is likely to make significant contributions to the economy as this industry can generate employment in the rural sector, meet the needs of local markets and utilize locally available raw materials to a great extent. In addition, development of cottage industry and also generate foreign exchange earnings lead to self-sufficiency in production of certain goods and commodities and thereby substitute imports and lead to an improvement in the economic conditions of the rural mass and help improve the present balance of payments situation That cottage industry can be developed through the mobilization of domestic resources itself makes it obvious that industrial development and expansion of an economy like ours is possible through the development of cottage industry. Moreover, given the direct positive effects in increasing the income of the rural mass, this industry has the potential to bring about positive changes in the whole of economy. Development of proper institutional support to the units scattered all over the country, therefore, is likely to yield benefits both from a short -term and a long-term consideration. Cottage Industry in the Sixth Plan It has be accepted the there have been some concrete achievements during the sixth Plan in policy developments and program-action related to cottage industry. Changes in the rule and regulation pertaining to the establishment of cottage brought about by the implementation of the Industrial Enterprises Act, 1981 B.S. has resulted in significant expansion and diversification of facilities for establishing and operating cottage industries, especially in terms of raw-materials and other inputs. Of this total registered units, only 584 (or 4.4 percent) units were dependents on imported raw material. Average per unit production of these units were dependents on imported raw material. Average per unit production of these units is estimated at Rs 2 million per annum with a total yearly production estimated at Rs 1170 million. Given the low initial capital investment, value-added component of these industries can be increase to another 40 percent. These consideration lead to the conclusion that cottage industries have made significant contributions gross domestic product, per capita income and in generation of employment. During the Sixth Plan period, intensive industry program was implemented in twenty district. Under this program nine districts in Bagmati and Gandaki Zone where cottage and small industry program and integrated village development program were underway with the assistance of World Bank were also covered. For the development and expansion of cottage industry, Sixth Plan has specified a target of training 13,170 persons under the general program whereas 15,780 persons were to be trained under the intensive program. Industrial survey twenty district, eight feasibility studies, implementation of three pilot projects technical assistance to 3,000 industrial units, formulation and distribution of 3,300 industrial schemes and management assistance to five industries were the program to be undertaken for industrial development and promotion during the plan period. In all, thirty-three districts were covered by industrial surveys, ten feasibility studies were completed and three pilot projects were implemented in addition to the development and distribution of 9,719 schemes. In the area of handicrafts promotion, 300 new designs were to be developed, 60 models prepared research in 15 areas related to handicraft to handicrafts were to be undertaken and fifteen exhibitions organized during the Sixth Plan. . Units thus operating have generated employment to a total of amount13,678 persons commercial and development banks have also extended loans amount to Rs 30.3 million to these areas under intensive banking program. During the plan period, raw materials and implements worth Rs 141.4 million were made available to different industries and goods worth Rs 24.2 million were procured from entrepreneurs engaged in cottage industry. Likewise, goods worth Rs 170 million were to be produced from different production units operating within the Department of Cottage Industry whereas the actual production of different goods has bee valued at Rs 186.9 million. The following objectives, policies and programs have been identified by the Seventh Plan for the development and promotic of cottage industry. Objectives 1. To create employment opportunities to check the problems of unemployment and under-employment both in the rural and urban areas and to increase direct incomes in the rural areas. 2. To develop this sector as an important source of foreign exchange earnings through improvements in productivity and quality of the products. 3. To increase production as this level to meet internal demand and to substitute imports. Policies 3. Appropriate curriculum and other bases will be developed to make skill development training program implemented through Cottage industry Department and Cottage Industry Development board more meaningful in the context of the needs of specific districts. 4. Services of cottage industry Handicrafts Sale Emporium will be further expanded to ensure regular supply of raw-materials. 5. Production of exportable products of cottage industry will be further expanded and such products will be standardized by coordinating efforts on production and market-development through agencies involved in export promotion. 6. Supply of adequate credit-facilities, implements and skills will be given especial emphasis to promote tourism- oriented industries based on trade traditional skills and technologies and using local raw-materials. 7. Instead of specifying independent targets for each of the different services, e.g. promotion, consultancy, financial assistance, registration and licensing, supply of raw-materials, designs and market development service required for the promotion and operation of cottage industries, a new process whereby targets are s pecified in a unified and coordinated manner will be developed and implemented. 8. Industrial villages based on local resources, raw materialsss and skills will be established and operated in districts which are still relatively less-developed. 9. Cottage Industry Development Board will implement short -term training program such as skill-development and entrepreneur-development in districts where intensive programs are already underway. However, in district and areas not covered under the intensive progra m, Department of Cottage Industry will be involved in running training courses. 10. A new project will be formulated and implemented to develop middle level manpower and to fully utilize the infrastructural bases that have already been developed within the Department of Cottage Industry. Program Programs for the development of cottage industry in the Seventh Plan have been categorized under three headings namely, general, intensive and promotional. A. General All activities and programs to be implemented through Department of Cottage Industry will be implemented under general program. Activity components such as technical training, industrial services, handicrafts promotion, ready-made garments and hand-made paper project, training for prison inmates, industrial data project and the operation of four regional centers will be included within this program. 1) \\tDepartment of Cottage Industry will organize training programs to create additional manpower at the entrepreneur, artism and mechanical worker\\'s level and to enhance the existing level of knowledge and skills of such manpower. 2) \\tFor the development and expansion of handicrafts industry 360 designs will be developed out of which 120 models will be prepared and 240 designs will be distributed. In addition, fifteen-research project will be undertaken and ten exhibitions will be organized. 3) \\tLikewise, industrial surveys in fifteen new district will be undertaken, reports on thirty district already covered under industrial survey will be published, 500 schemes distributed, technical assistance to 380 industries will be extended, four pilot-projects implemented, five feasibility studies and research on five topics undertaken and 20 pairs and exhibitions will be organized to develop and cottage industries. 4) \\tTen statistical profiles will be prepared and 500 industrial units will be observed and checked, 35 seminars and twenty refresher training course will be organized under industrial statistics and administration. B. Intensive Program Intensive program for industrial expansion and development will be implemented through Cottage and Small industries Development Board. This program will cover projects like cottage and small-scale project run under the World Bank assistance and Integrated Rural Development Projects, Industrial Village Project to be run under Swiss assistance in Dolakha and Sindhupalchok districts. Under these project 5,500 persons will be trained on motivation, entrepreneur develop and management and 9,600 persons will be prepared and distributed, 1380 industrial units will receive technical assistance and raw-materials and implements equivalent to an amount of Rs 15.2 million will be supplied. C. Promotional Program Ceramics project, entrepreneur development program and training for gainful rural activity will be covered and implemented under this program. This program consists of mobile training under which 4,600 persons will be trained, another training program which will impart training on different skills to 1030 persons in addition to the establishment of a ceramics industry and initiation of related research in this area. Raw materials and other implements necessary for local cottage and rural industries and sales service for the products of these industries will be provided through Cottage Industry Sales Center and through other institutional mechanisms. In all, thirteen projects in different parts of the country will be implemented under this program. Supply of different raw materials worth Rs 400.7 million, supply of other necessary implements worth Rs 30.7 million, sale of different products of these industries worth 40.2 million through direct procurement arrangement, construction of 10 godowns and offices and expansion of 15 branch-offices are some of the targeted goal of these projects as a whole. D. Program Under Decentralization A total of 75 branch-offices in different districts run under the Department of Cottage and Small-scale Industry will be covered under this program Activities such as identification of industries which can be developed and established on a local basis, selection of trainees and promotion of people\\'s participation in promotion of industries and in skill development training will be carried out under this program. Trade occupies a prominent place in economic development of . On other hand, the country has to dpand on imports even to implement programs is likely to have adverse effect on imports even to implement programs designed to strengthen the economy. However, this dependence on imports is likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments and give rise to new challenges. This kind of situation calls for a well- managed and regulated import policy and for a planned drive to increase exports so that the balance of payments situation is in favor of the country. In this background, only through proper development of the trade and commerce sector will it be possible to increase foreign exchange earnings through increased exports to finance the imports of goods essential for development. In fact, the present situation characterized by the need to rely on imports even to meet basic development aspirations makes it imperative to expand exports. But, on other hand, it does not seems possible to significantly expand the production of new exportable commodities without effecting major transformations, within a short period of time, in the economy dependent inordinately in agriculture. Thus, in the present context, it has become necessary to increase the production of goods, which were traditionally exported. However, it will also be possible through increased industrial production, to substitute imports and to effect significant savings in import spending. This arrangement will also ensure that both agricultural products receive maximum prices. Foreign loans and assistance will certainly increase in the Seventh Plan period as compared as compared to the receipt of these in the Sixth Plan period. In addition, principals, and interests of loans received in earlier plan periods have also to be repaid. This situation again reinforces the need to increase foreign exchange earnings through increased exports and also signifies the important role of trade and commerce in the overall development of the country. The geo-physical structure of the country has resulted in a contraction of the internal market whereas the land-locked situation of the country has made it very difficult to export Nepalese goods and commodities in the competitive international markets, especially in the context of absence of proper transit facilities. The need to strengthen and to render the transit system less expensive and to increase the numerical terms the transit facilities presently available. In addition, to ensuring proper transit right in conformity with the provisions and agreements made by international bodies and under bilateral agreements is equal cogent. In addition, the transit system has to be linked to the infrastructures created in the country to accelerate the pace of expansion of the national market. Review of the Sixth Plan Seen in the background of the fact that the annual rate of growth of exports had remained at 5 percent whereas that of imports was 14 percent during the Fifth Plan period, it has to be recognized that the objectives pursued by the Sixth Plan to reduce this imbalance through increased standardization and through additional financial and monetary incentives to strengthen and stabilize the export sector has yield positive results in terms of diversification gained in the commodity mix of exports and in the composition of trading partners. Total foreign trade of the country stood at Rs 4630 million in fiscal year 1979/80, which was also the last year covered by the Fifth Plan period, the figure had nearly doubled to a total of Rs 8220 million and it is estimated to further increase to a total of the 9630 million by the end of the plan period. Thus, it is estimated that the annual rate of growth in foreign trade will be 16.1 percent in current prices during the plan period. The Sixth Plan specified a target to increase the exports at an annual rate of 2.5 percent (in 1979/80 constant prices) to a total of Rs 6360 million during the plan period. It is likely that export earnings from export earnings from exports to India and to oversea countries, including the estimated earnings for fiscal year 1984/85 will total Rs8095 million (in current prices) during the plan indicating, by and large, the fulfillment of the specified target. The annual rate of growth in exports was 5 percent (in current prices) during the Fifth Plan period whereas this annual rate seems to have increased to 17.1 percent during this plan period. However this rate of growth is rather sensitive and has to be accepted with a number of cautions. For example, the figure for export earning in fiscal year in 1979/80 was Rs 1150 million which increased by 39 percent to Rs 1607 million in the first year of the plan (F.Y. 1980/81) but declined by 7 percent to reach a total of Rs 1132 million in the third year whereas export earnings reached a total of Rs 1704 million in the fourth year of the plan period thereby registering an increase of 50 percent over the earning of the preceding year. It is estimated that export earnings will further increase by about 27 percent and reach a total of Rs 2160 million in the last year of the plan period. Exports to  accounted for an earning of Rs 5262 million of the total export earnings in the Sixth Plan period. Export earnings of Rs 521 million in base year 1979/80 has increased to Rs 1161 million in fiscal year 1983/84 and is estimated to increase further to Rs 1272 million in fiscal year 1984/85. Thus, the average annual rate of growth of exports to  is likely to be 30.6 percent. A substantial decline has occurred in the export of goods and commodities to oversea countries. Export to overseas was equivalent to Rs 630 million in fiscal year 1979/80 whereas earnings from this source of exports declined continuously to r3each a total of just Rs 290 million in the third year of the plan. However, some improvements occurred in the fourth year as earnings totaled Rs F543 million. Some improvements have also occurred in the export of leather and hides. In addition, goods such as catechu solvent extraction and ready-made garments have also shown strong export possibilities whereas export of items such as big cafdamon, rice, handicrafts, dried-ginger, raw-jute and jute goods to be losing ground. Recession in international market, protectionist policy adopted by importing nations, keen competition and increasing transit cost have affected very adversely Nepalese exports to overseas countries during the period in consideration. Likewise, waiving of the dual-exchange rate also seems to have lessened the attraction to engaged in export activities. An exchange rate based on currency basket was introduced during the midterm of the plan to eliminate this situation. In addition, the introduction of financial assistance in export of leather and hides, pre-export loan arrangement in addition to the provision to make available, a certain percentage of export earnings to the exporter and improvement and simplification in banking, financial administrative and other procedures favoring export trade as a result of the implementation of the nine-points export program have resulted in positive changes Total imports had increased by 27 percent in fiscal year in 1980/81 as compared to the previous year and had stood at Rs 4428 million whereas the estimated spending on imports in fiscal year 1984/85 is likely to be equivalent to Rs 7470 million and this, is likely to register an increase of 14.7 percent over that of fiscal year 1983/84. With imports form India totaling Rs 13380 million (45 percent) and imports from overseas totaling Rs 16276 million (55 percent), it is estimated that the total imports bill during the plan period will be equivalent to Rs 29656 million. The annual rate of growth of imports, from  growing at an annual rate of 13.7 percent and imports from overseas countries growing 20.8 percent. Imports from  accounted for 51.2 percent of the total imports in fiscal year 1979/80 whereas this share declined to 45 percent in fiscal year 1983/84 suggesting thereby an increasing rate of growth in imports from third countries and a relative decline in the growth of imports from . Exports to  as a proportion of imports there from was 38 percent whereas the same in the context of overseas countries was just 15.7 in fiscal year 1983/84. In the background of increasing demands for imports, balance of trade deficit amounted to Rs 2330 million and to Rs2820 million respectively in the last year of the Fifth and the first year of the Sixth Plan but this deficit nearly doubled to Rs 4810 million in fiscal year 1983/84. This has resulted in the balance of payments situation being adversely with a gradual decline foreign exchange savings. The balance of trade deficit is estimated to reach a total of Rs 5310 million in fiscal year 1984.85. This deficit thus estimated to have increased at an annual rate 19.3 percent during the Sixth Plan period. During this plan period, certain changes in the composition and nature of export items have occurred for example, in fiscal year 1980/81, unprocessed and semi-processed goods accounted for 91 percent of the total exports to . But by fiscal year 1983/84, semi-processed and unprocessed goods accounted for only 39 percent of the total exports to , Likewise, in the same period, share of unprocessed and semi processed goods declined from 33 percent to 2.5 percent of the total exports to overseas . Foreign trade had to weather a number difficulty during the Sixth Plan period. Export sector could not achieve the expected level of performance mainly because the basic structures needed to develop the export sector were lacking. In addition, there were only a few finished exportable commodities. On the other hand, increase in prices of construction materials, petroleum products, chemical fertilizer and other such commodities essential for development programs exerted upward pressure in imports. This state of affairs foreshadows a situation in future whereby imports of not only construction goods but even if items needed for daily consumption will have to be controlled if foreign assistance can not be mobilized to the needed extent. The progress of programs determined for the Sixth Plan period in the commerce and supply sector is briefly summarized in the following paragraphes. 1. : This center studied the process involved from production to export of commodities such as carpets, big cardamon, tobacco, pulses, solvent oil, ready-made garments (cotton) and handicrafts and has prepared an export plan for these commodities during the first four years of the Plan period. Likewise, a program to develop four exportable items, namely, dried ginger, catechu, vegetable seeds and paper products has also been prepared during the same period. Furthermore, it is estimated that there will be fifty seven participation in international trade fairs during the plan period either of this center or of the private sector. This center also undertook outside study of market for four oversea countries, prepared254 company profiles of exporters in addition to collection 54 projects profiles and prepared a directory of foreign importers in the first four years of the plan. 2. Transit and Godown Company Limited: This company had targeted at the construction of a loading and unloading platform at  port during the plan period which, however, is likely to remain unattained. A godown with 2,000 metric ton capacity has been constructed at the railway head of Raxaul and another godown in the premises of customs at Birgunj is under construction. In addition, land has been taken in lease for construction of a godown in Haldia port in  and the establishment of a transit information service center has also been completed. 3. National Trading Limited: This institution is estimated to import foods and commodities equivalent to Rs 679.4 million during the plan period in addition, to undertake construction of godowns at Prokhara with a 2,000 MT capacity, at Nepalgunj with 7,000 MT capacity and Birgunj and at Tribhuvan Airport in Kathmandu with a capacity of 4,000 MT each to a total capacity of 17,000 metric tons. An office building with a staff quarter and a show room in Pokhara is also expected to see the completion of construction works. Construction of two bayes bridges with a capacity of 30 mectric ton each in Birgunj and Pokhara have also been completed. 4. Jute Development and Trade Corporation: During the Plan period, this corporation is likely to complete 60 percent of the construction works of the research center building, produce 905 MT. of improved variety jute seeds and 199 thousand mt. of jute forms, sale 784 MT. of improved seeds and exported 123 thousand MT. of jute in addition to completed the construction woks on seed -processing godown. 5. Nepal Oil Corporation: This corporation is expected to complete construction works of 43 fuel storage tanks to a total capacity of 949 K.L. in Biratnagar, Kathmandu, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj in addition, to these at Dhangadi and Amlekhgunj which were yet to be completed by the end of the Fifth Plan period. In addition, the corporation is expected to import petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, bitumin and other like products to an estimated total of 6,29,521 M.T. during the plan period. 6. Cottage Industry Exports Development Project: Implemented since fiscal year 1982/83 this project has entered into work-service agreements with five private sector entrepreneurs to produce woolen and cotton textiles for export in Kaski, Syanja, and Gorkha districts of Gandaki Zone in addition into run training programs on production of woolen products, established a sales promotion officer under the name of \"Production of Nepal\" in  and arranged for sales promotion and observation tour in  and Asian countries for two teams of exporters. 7. Salt Trading Corporation Ltd. This corporation is estimated to supply 3,81,211 M.T. of salt and 1,02,921 M.T. of sugar during the plan n period. The above considerations suggest that though the targets specified for the export sector net and though the foreign exchange earnings from the sector has been increasing in current prices it has to be admitted that net earnings have not increased compared to the earnings have not increased compared to the earnings in the base year. Increasing imports from third countries and the big gap between exports and imports have erodeal the positive contributions from increased foreign exchange earnings from export as a consequence of the revaluation of U.S. dollars. Expansion of development progra ms on the one hand and delays in the process of industrialization which could lead to the economy towards self-sufficiency on the other call for a concentration of efforts to reduce the excessive dependence on imports which characteristics the present situation. To reduce the excession dependence on imports it has become necessary to increase the pace of industrialization to substitute imports, and to develop and expand the export sector to provide foreign exchange earnings for imports of essential commodities. The new trends, observed during the Sixth Plan period, characterizing exports to be  oriented whereas imports tend to originate from the third country can not be accepted as sign of healthy development in the foreign trade sector. Increase exports to  will indeed help reduce the deficit in Indian currency holdings but this will not help finance the increasing imports bills which have to be paid U.S. dollars. To change this situation, the structure of foreign trade has to be changed to favor greater imports from India or export trade has to be expanded to be diversified both on a country wise and commodity-wise basis to intimate the adverse effects on balance of payments situation. Transit costs and transit facilities also play a very significant role in the smooth and free conduct of import and export trades. The country still has to face many of the problems arising from the land-locked situation of the country as the program implemented with a view to reduce transport costs and to make the transit systems more efficient during the Sixth Plan have not yielded the expected benefits. However, during the plan period many developments on an institutional basis have been made in addition to the completion of different studies in this area which should pave the way foe a more efficient transit system in future. These achievements have to be focused on furthering effort, to ensure the rights to transit facilities and to reduce transit cost to make Nepalese exports more competitive Objective 1. To gradually make the balance of payment situation more favorable through expansion and development of the export sector. 2. To go on creating necessary infrastructures to make the imports of goods and commodities essential for national development more smooth and well managed. 3. To maximize the benefits of foreign trade to the national economy by making the transit system more efficient and less-expensive. Policy 1. A plan will be formulated and implemented in a coordinated manpower to expand the export sector through increase in domestic production and through standarization of the produced goods and commodities. 2. A process to diversify and expand export trade will be initiated on the basis of periodic evaluation of emerging trends. 3. \\tnecessary steps will be taken to ensure proper use of the facilities provide under bilateral and multilateral agreements to make export sector more responsible to the needs of the nation 4. The role of the private sector will be expanded in the export sector and safe-gurads will be provided to the interests of the private sector involved in export activities with out prejudice to the national interest. 5. Necessary amendments will be incorporated in the present acts, rules and regulations governing export trade on the basis of periodic review of such acts, rule and regulations. 6. Protection necessary for the establishment and operation of industries geared towards expansion of exports of towards achieving self-sufficiency will granted through the instrument of appropriate trade policies. 7. Imports priority will be accorded to goods and commodities essential for national development and for daily consumption where imports of other goods and commodities will be discouraged. 8. Necessary improvements will be introduced in the present system of appointment evaluation and incentives to improve the performance and expertise of the public corporations involved in import trade. 9. The structure of import trade will be changed both on a commodity-wise and county and country-wise as may be required in conformity with the trends identified in the balance of payments situation. 10. With a view to reduce transit cost, new transit facilities will be introduced in addition to the existing areas. 11. Institutions involved in the management of transit facilities will be further strengthened and made more efficient. 12. Measures which can contribute towards improving the transit system and towards increasing the storage capacity and which can be immediately implemented with the country will be identified and executed within the country will be identified and executed. Necessary arrangements will be made with the concerned party to extended the broad gauge and meter gauge Indian railway lines to appropriate lines to appropriate places in  in order to remove the present transit difficulties. Working Policies 1. Efforts will be focused on formulating and implementing an integrated five years plan to increase the production, productivity, quality and volume of exports of industrial and agricultural goods and commodities which are presently exported or which show promises for export to neighboring countries or to third countries on a selective basis. 2. There will be no restrictions on the free movements within the country of goods and commodities identified for promotion of expert and either the price nor the quantity of such exportable commodities will be controlled or restricted. 3. An effective system to resolve problems related to production. Productivity, quality and exports of goods and commodities identified in the course of periodic reviews will be developed and implemented. 4. A system will be devised whereby exporters automatically receive the concession and facilities provided for expanding and promoting export trade. 5. In order to maintain the competition of our exporters, a system whereby necessary steps can be initiated on the basis of research and study on the production cost of exportable goods and commodities, current prices of our export in different countries and current prices of our exports in different countries and the foreign exchange regime in the country will be developed. 6. A program aiming at fixing the standards for exportable goods and commodities, establishing laboratory facilities to test the standard and qualities and aiming to provide pre-export tests and certificates will be formulated and put under implementation. 7. Present administrative procedures ncluding those related to the issue of export license, customs examination and banking transaction will be simplified, strengthened and more efficient. 8. It is imperative to improve the present complicated and cumbersome transit process if the export sector is to be expanded and if our exporters are to be competitive with others in the third countries. Hence, a long term and short term plan to make the transit process less expensive and more efficient will be implemented, with the cooperation of the neighboring country, if necessary, on a priority wise basis. 9.

Chapter 35 TOURISM Inroduction The contributions of the tourism sector in the overall national development have been quite significant. Specially, this sector has contributed significantly in the balance of payments situation through foreign exchange earning and in the creation of employment opportunities. is endowed with unique cultural traditions, majestic panoramic scenes and with the highest snow-capped mountains which do not fail to tempt and challenge the courageous ones. The rare flora and fauna, religions and cultural diversity and the simple and quiteless life - style of its people have added to the attraction of  as a tourist centre. Efforts to develop and capitalize on these features of the country have been going on for a number of years. But even then, the benefits of tourism sector has been limited to a few pockets of the country and there have been going on for a number of years. But even then, the benefits of tourism sector has been limited to a few pockets of the country and there have been no significant successes in expanding the role of this sector in an organised and well-planned manner to realise the potential benefits in the overall national development endeavours. Even the increase in the flow of tourists to other areas outside  has not yielded the expected benefits to the general mass. On the other hand, lack of infrastructural development has hindered the development of other beautiful places as center of tourist attraction. The need of the day is to develop tourism sector not only as a medium of foreign-exchange earnings but also as a catalact which can contribute positively to the whole development process. Tourism Development in the Sixth Plan The total number of tourists who visited  in fiscal year 1979/80 (i.e. the last year of the Fifth Plan) was 1,62,276. The number of visitors increased by only 0.4 percent and by 0.8 percent respectively in the first and second years of the Sixth Plan period whereas there was an encouraging increase by 8.5 percent in the number of tourists visiting  in the third year. However, the rate of increase again slowed doewn to only 2.4 percent in the fourth year. Data on the number of tourist arrival suggest that a total number of 6,79,420 tourists visited  in the first four year of the Sixth Plan period. The average rate of increase during the first four years of the Fifth Plan was 15 percent whereas the rate of increase has declined to only 3 percent during the same period of the Sixth Plan. Of the total number of tourists who visited Nepal in the last year of the Fifth Plan period (1979), 12.04 percent came from North America, 1.1 percent from Central and South America, 42.0 percent from West Europe, 10 percent from East Europe, 0.20 percent from Africa, 36.50 percent from Asia, 5.7 pecent from Australia and the Pacific and 0.10 percent came very areas during the first four years of the Sixth Plan (up to 1983) suggest a slight incre ase for almost all the sources, the trend of yearly increase, by that except for Asia (in which the majority is from India). Europe occupies  was 43.2 percent of the total tourist arrivals whereas arrivals from over five percent. The number of tourist arrivals from  was 36.5 percent period which has increased by about five percent to claim a share of 41.6 percent of the total tourist arrivals in 1983. These figures reveal that the member of tourist arrivals from the region itself is on the increase. Looked in totality, Europe still occupies the most important place except for  as the source of tourist arrivals. The trend of foreign exchange earnings, during the last four years from the tourism sector is not very encouraging. For example, in the first year earnings increased by 18.9 percent, declined by 19.9 percent in the second year, again declined by 0.6 percent in the third year and increased by 19.3 percent in the fourth year of the plan. Thus, though there has been some increase in the number of tourist arrivals foreign exchange earnings have failed to increase. This state of affairs suggests just the increase in number of tourist arrivals does not guarantee, by itself, increase in foreign exchange earnings and that qualitative improvements are also called for. The average duration of stay of tourists in Nepal was 11.5 days in 1983. 65.5 percent of the tourists stayed for a period of 1 to 7 days. The figure for 1983 reveal that of the total number of 1,79,405 tourists who came to Nepal, 32,298 or 18 percent went on for trekking, mostly in Annapurna, Manang and Jomsom areas. A number of these trekkers also go to Everest, Helambu and Langtang areas. Except for these areas, only 417 trekkers went to other parts of the country. Earnings from trekkers in 1983 came to about Rs 38,75,760 (calculated on the basis of average duration of 14 days and visa charge of Rs 60 for one week). Earnings from their source can also be significant by increased if tourist facilities could be extended to other areas of the country as well. That mountaineering is also an attractive area for promotion of tourism is substantiated by the number of applications received for moujtaineering permits to scale the major peaks of Nepal. Of the 1310 peaks higher than 6000 metres, Nepal has opened 115 peaks to mountaineering expeditions. During theSixth Plan period (from autumn 1980 to 1985 spring) there were 411 mountaineering expeditions and it is estimated that these expeditions generated empllyment opportunities for about 2000 persons engaged in climbing. Royalty from these expeditions totalled Rs 6,001,549 whereas these expeditions are estimated to have spent Rs 83,450,962 in their stay in Nepal. In addition, those teams also paid a premium of Rs 2,076,838 on insurance of Nepalese climbers. Thus, a total income of Rs 91,529,349 equivalent of foreign exchange is estimated to have accrued to Nepal from mountaineering expeditions during the Sixth Plan period. The number of hotel-beds in Kathmandu in 1979 totalled 4925 which have registered an increase of 38.45 percent to reach a total of 6819 in 1983. The occupancy rates, based on 1983 figures, came to 32.9 percent in the hotels of Kathmandu whereas it was only 28.9 percent for hotels outside Kathmandu. The average duration of stay of tourists in hotels was rather low with only 2.6 nithts per tourist. For example, of the total numhber of 162,279 tourists who visited Nepal in 1979, 79 percent listed entertainment as the purpose of their visit. In 1983, 73.8 percent of the tourists also listed entertainment as the main purpose of their visit. Of the total number of tourists visiting Nepal in 1979, 60 percent were male and 40 percent female. Looking at the age composition of these tourists, we find that 36.2 percent belonged to the 16 to 30 year age-groups and 29.8 percent belonged to the 31 to 45 year age group. In 1983, the percentage of tourists in 16 to 30 age-group was 23.8 with those in 31 to 45 age-group being 31.5 percent. Thus, the number of tourists on the younger age-group seems to be on the decline. The total number of tourists visiting Nepal in the first six months 1984 was 91,233 which reflected an increase of 9.1 percent compared to the figures for the same period in 1983. Of the total number of visitors in the first half of 1984, 9,320 were of American origin, 6930 were British, 7691 French, 4790 German and 3650 were from japan. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism sector in fiscal year 1983/84 totalled an equivalent of Rs 586 million. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism sector was an equivalent of Rs 617 million in fiscal year 1980/81 and equivalent of Rs 494 million in fiscal year 1981/82. Review of Programs Included in the Sixth Plan 1. Sixth Plan had Included the preparation of a ‘tourism master plan’ (second -phase) – A team of experts under the assistance of European Economic Community visited Nepal in the fourth year of the plan period and have completed a tour of possible tourist resort in addition to holding extensively discussions with concerned Nepalese authorities and a detailed review of the tourism master plan (first phase). 2.

LABOUR Introduction An increase in per capita productivity with positive effects on the gross domestic product is possible only if the problems related to unemployment and underemployment can be fully tackled. The unemployment situation does not present a really discouraging picture as only 5.62 percent of the labour force is estimated to be openly unemployed. However, data on underemployment present an alarming picture as 63.7 percent of the labour force in rural areas and 44.7 percent of the labour force in urban areas are underemployed. During the decade, the number of those reaching the age bracket of economically active labour force increased by 51.05 in the hilly region and by 38.60 percent in the Terai region. The labour force is estimated to grow by about 0.2 million persons per year, calculated on the basis of this rate of growth of the total population. The rate of increase, on the basis of the result of 1981 census is estimated at 1.36 percent in the mountainous region. These figures suggest that as compared to the mountainous region, population pressure on the limited arable  is increasing whereas this pressure (which was rather high) seems to be gradually easing out in the mountainous region. The easing of population pressure in the mountains could also be interpreted to indicate increased migration the Terai. It can be accepted that a natural outcome of the relatively high level and pace of infrastructural development in Terai has been an increase in the pace of urbanization. Increasing urbanization and migration have led to a growing concentration of population in the Terai area with significant increase in the size of the labour force which can not be fully mopped-up by the employment opportunities created thereby ongoing development works thereby suggesting that the pro blem of unemployment and underemployment are not getting any better even in this region whereas in the hilly region, given the relatively limited level of ongoing development activities and given the lack of the significant positive changes in the agricultural and non agricultural sectors, the unemployment and underemployment problems are getting worse. In the mountain areas, these problems can be assumed to be more acute as opportunity for gainful activities is limited to the monsoon season only. However, it can be assumed that a large segment of the labour remains idle in this area due to the shortage of employment opportunities. Thus, looking at the problem from a national perspective, it has to be accepted that the problems of unemployment and underemployment are pervasive in all regions and areas of the country. The Sixth Plan had accorded \"increase in productive employment opportunities\" a prominent place in its objective essentially to emphasis the need to balance increase in employment opportunities with the increase inn labour force and to counter-act the negative effects of an idle labour force on the national economy. The 1981 census result, as compared to the result of 1971 census, shows an increase ranging from 16 percent of 48 percent in all age cohorts of the economically active population. Labour force in the 55-59 years cohort shows the least increase whereas the 20-24 years age-cohort shows an increase of 48 percent. There is a maximum concentration of the labour force in the 20-29 years age cohort. Moreover, efforts to ease the excessive pressure of this labor force from agriculture to others sectors of the economy have net only with limited success during the decade under reference. Only 3 percent of the population has shifted from agriculture to non agriculture sectors in 1981 as compared to 1971. Though the increase in the number of persons employed under services sector has shown an encouraging increase of 10.7 percent, the gap between creation of employment opportunities and the rate of increase in labour force does not, however, show any signs of being bridge up, resulting in a situation full of challenges. And there is no indication of changes for the better in this situation, especially as no institutional mechanism has been devised and developed to impact basic skills to the members of the labour force, which would enable them to gain access to the employment opportunities created in the labour market. As the created employment opportunities look minimal compared to the unemployment and underemployment situation, the need to invest on total mobilization of the labour force becomes a matter of national priority. If there is a big shortage of employment opportunities in the rural areas, there is also a shortage of labour with necessary skills and qualities in the urban areas. Thirteen studies (of Jhapa, Biratnager, Dharan, Janakpur, Birgunj, Pokhara, Siddharthanagar, Dang, Surkhet, Darchula, Baitadi Illam and of Kathmandu) undertaken by the Department of Labour on certain aspects of the labour market suggst that demand for labour of these markets came to combined total of 48,438 persons whereas the actually supply was only 32,512 persons leaving, thereby, an unmet demand of 15,876 laborers. With the above considerations in background, efforts to generate increased opportunities for productive employment have to be based on the following two strategies: - to increase investment in projects likely to have a direct impact in easing the unemployment and underemployment problems, and Though efforts in this direction have to be made through a coordinated institutional approach, it would not be out of context to reiterate the fact that there can be no significant increase in the creation of employment opportunities in investments to increase production in both the agricultural and non agricultural sectors are not forthcoming. On the other hand, efforts to improve quality and skills of labour, available within the country but remaining idle, in conformity with the demands of the labour market are also likely to pay high dividends. The Department of Labour, within the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, is present by engaged in this area. On the whole, efforts to fully utilize the labour force of the country are likely to yield positive effects to the national economy in the form of a) evolution of a scientific and systematized mechanism for supply of labour as defined by the growth of the economy, b) production and supply of domestic labour in conformity with the needs of the labour market and replacement of foreign laborers, and c) increase in income through mobilization of domestic labour in the competitive employment opportunities created. In addition to other considerations, labour has significant role to play in maintaining a peaceful working atmosphere in the industrial sector conductive to increased investment and production. It is equally important to protect the interest of the labour and to maintain working discipline as it is to ensure that adverse developments do not disrupt the production. The following changes in the minimum wages levels were effected by the government during the Sixth Plan period. Fixing minimum wage level has a salutory effect on the maintenance of peaceful working conditions though it has to be admitted that the diverse nature of different industries, their production characteristics and ownership patterns make it difficult to treat all workers as a homogenous group and provide equal benefits. Minimum wage level have to be fixed in a way which does not have any adverse effects on the industries but in the meantime takes into consideration the welfare of the workers. Thus, a policy whereby the minimum wage level supplements and encourages investment and productivity and takes into consideration the welfare of the laborers as well will be followed during the Seventh Plan period. Looking from the demand side, there seems to be an acute shortage of semi-skilled and skilled labour in the Mid-western and the Far-western development regions whereas a surplus is limited to some districts, which have easy access and are relatively developed in the Central development region. Review of the Sixth Plan In all ten projects directed at the development of the labour sector were implemented during the Sixth The plan had envisaged establishment of an Employment Research and  and preparation of ten pilot schemes, five manpower development manual and research studies on five topical issues related to employment problems. Surveys related to skill needs and supplies have also been completed in six districts. The Sixth Plan had also specified a target of holdings three seminars on population education in the organized sector and running of thirty-six motivation and intensive trainings. Only three additional labour supply centres in Jhapa, Itahari and Dhangadhi were established vis -à -vis the target of establishing five centers during the Sixth Plan period. The total number of Labour supply Centers has now reached six as three center in Hetauda, Nepalgunj and Butwal were already established during the Fifth Plan period. Objectives 1. To enhance quality and level of skills of labour with a view to mobilize, to the maximum possible extent, domestic labour and to raise the level of national productivity. 2. To strengthen and make more efficient the programs related to employment generation, both at the domestic and foreign level, on the basis of appropriate studies to generate greater employment opportunities and to resolve unemployment related problems. 3. To ma ke more effective the systems related labour welfare in conformity with the welfare needs of the labour. 4. To involve, to the maximum possible extent, Nepali labour in employment opportunities created by development efforts. Policies 1. The level of skills of labour will further be enhanced and necessary industrial and vocational training will be imparted to the members of idle rural labour force with the aim to mobilize ad supply labour to the non agricultural sector as per its needs. 2. Legal provis ions will be developed and made more effective so as to make it obligatory for industrial concerns to utilize domestic labour to the maximum possible extent. In addition to this, apprentice training for Nepali citizens will also be made compulsory in industrial concerns where non citizens are presently engaged with a view to make more effective the programs directed at replacement of non citizen labour. 3. Programs on employment research and promotion will be further strengthened and implemented. 4. Labour exchange service will be extended and developed on an institutional setting and legal provisions necessary to this land will be devised and developed. 5. Private sector will be encouraged to develop an institutional mechanism to facilitate inter-sectoral mobility of labour. Working Policy 1. A system hereby the management of an undertaking in the organized sector which employs hundred or more semi-skilled laborers will itself have to appoint a labour welfare officer will be implemented to safeguard the welfare of the laborers. 2. With the Industrial Training Act already effective, greater efforts will be directed at making the apprenticeship -training program in industrial ventures more effective. 10. Ministry of Labour Social Welfare will collect relevant information and arrange to run local training programs in areas where big projects are to be constructed and run by the government. 11. A well-planned program will be implemented in a few selected industrial venturues to fully replace the non- citizen labour. Skill-development training will be organized more widely and intensively as a component of this program. Labour supply Centers located in Jhapa, Itahari, Hetauda, Butwal, Nepalgunj and in Dhangadhi have been operating for a considerable period of time essentially to strengthen and expand the labour supply system and to enhance the productivity of labour through appropriate at site trainings. Program in this area aims at a further broadening of the areas of activity of these centers to train 4740 persons including 650 women on subjects like cutting, knitting, tailoring, carpentry, press composition, masonry, machine-operation, milling, biri-making, apprenticeship, boiler operation, textile mechanics, tyring, wring, spinning, stone cutting and so on during the plan period. These centers, it is also envisaged, will undertake skill-surveys of 100 Panchayats. 2. Industrial and Vocational Training Program A one-year training program for 300 trainers on subjects like fitting, lathe-operation, milling, welding, machine repair, wiring and electric installation, metal work and pipe fitting is expected to be implemented to enhance the skills of labour by the Vocational Training Center at Rani in Biratnagar. The Vocational Training Project, located at , has a program to train 200 persons including 150 women on hair dressing the plan period. 3. Employment Research and Established in the Sixth Plan period with the objective of undertaking research and developing policies on issues related to the development of productive labour force in an organized manner, this center has a program to further intensify and strengthen search project, to develop occupational classification of labour involved in industrial and development works in three sectors, prepare job inventory of one sector and to prepare ten pilot scheme, five manpower manuals and reports on the labour market of five sectors, namely, of transport, construction, mining, commercial enterprise and of tea garden. 4. Foreign Employment Service Foreign employment service will be implemented in an organized manner and this program will have components such as collection of information on those workers who have migrated to foreign countries for seeking employment opportunities and those who are already in foreign countries with a view to safeguard their interest and welfare and development of manpower in conformity with the needs of foreign labour markets. 5. Labour Exchange Services Department of Labour in addition to the Labour-supply Centers already established or to be established will implement a program aimed at collection of information on employment opportunities and dissemination of this information through out the kingdom with a view to assist both the employers and the employees and to reduce the time lay involved in filling up a vacancy. In addition to the establishment of this center, a study will also be commissioned with the assistance of I.L.O. to improve the physical facilities available at and the functioning of, Labour- supply Centers. It is further estimated that the total installed capacity will reach 1,55,941 k.w. of which 1,29,509 will be generated power and 26,432 k.w. diesel generated power by the end of this Sixth Plan. Thus, though the power generation, especially Hydro-electric power generation capacity of the country has increased substantially, it has to be admitted that the achievement in this area has always lagged for behind the power generation targets specified by the periodic plans. The percentage achievements from the First to the Sixth Plans against the specified targets were respectively: 4.8, 13.8, 33.7, 70.3, 31.8 and 60.5 percent. Looking at the supply situation of power, in inability to increase the supply at the same time rate at which the demand for it was growing was affecting adversely the developments of the industrial, agricultural, commercial and domestic sectors even by the end of the Fifth Plan. The shortage of power had further worsened in the first two years of the Sixth Plan. Since the third year of the plan period, when 60,000 k.w. of power was generated from Kulekhani Hydro-Electric Project and added to the sources of supply, the situation has much improved. But now, it has also been noted that as the demand for power supply did not increase at the expected rate, more than 50 percent of the generating capacity of Kulekhani Hydro-Electric Project remains unutilized. Thus, while there is a very cogent need to initiate steps to increase the demand for power so as not to let the generating capacity remain unutilized, there is also an equally important need to develop a system during the Seventh Plan period whereby the demand for and supply of power will balance each other. In the second year of this plan period, that is fiscal year 1986/87 Kulekhani II Hydro -Electric Project (32,000 k.w. In the area of extension of power supply, only 41 districts have received power supply services so far whereas the 34 mountainous districts are yet to received the supply to the rural areas for the economic development of these areas in addition, to the rural areas for the economic development of these areas in addition, to strengthening and widening the coverage of the electricity services even in areas which presently are receiving these facilities. It is in cognizance of all these facts and figures that the Seventh Plan has aimed at the development of the power sector. Review of the Sixth Plan The Sixth Plan had specified a target of generating 1,24,000 k.w. from big-hydro -electricity projects 5,833 k.w. from small hydel projects and 15,000 k.w. from diesel plants to a total additional generating capacity of 1,44,923. However, the total increase in generating capacity was only 86,045 k.w. during the plan period. Of this increase, big hydro -electricity projects like Kulekhani and Devighat accounted respectively for 60,000 k.w. and 14,100 k.w. while eight small hydel plants accounted for 1271 k.w. and in the area of diesel generated power, Hetauda Diesel Plant accounted for 10,000 k.w. and other small diesel plants for 674 k.w. By the end of this fiscal year (i.e. 1984/85) as additional supply of 1,500 k.w. is expected to be generated from Pokhara water utilization project and as one more small hydel project is expected to be completed, the progress in the area of generating additional power supply during the Sixth Plan will be 87,595 k.w. In comparison to the specified target, this progress is only 60.4 percent of the target. Phase whereas the main construction works of Marsyandi hydro-electricity Project (66,000 k.w.) is expected to begin by the end of this fiscal year (1984/85), the last year of the plan. The progress in the construction of transmission lines between Hetauda-Biratnagar and Dumkebas-Butwal is expected to have reached around 90 percent. In the area of strengthening power supply system, works on both the first and second phase have been already completed in Kathmandu, while the first and second phase have been already completed in Kathmandu, while the first-phase strengthening program in Biratnagar is expected to be completed by the end of the plan period. These measures are expected to improve power supply capacity and check, to a certain expent, system- loss and other leakage. Extension of electricity services in the existing and new supply centers are being continued. Pre-feasibility studies of Kali Gandaki II (4,80,000 kw), Budi Gandaki (6,00,000 kw) and Seti West (1,05,000 kw) and the economic and technical feasiblilty studies of Koshi river basin master plan, Mulghat Hydro-Electricit y Project (68,000 kw) and Sapta Gandaki Hydro -Electricity project (2,25,000 kw) have been completed during the Sixth Plan period. However, there has been no progress in the completion of feasibility studies on a project identified as the most appropriate from the study on Koshi river basin master plan and on Rapti and Bagmati rivers as were specified by the Sixth Plan. Impediments, Hindrances and Problems Both external and internal factors have been identified as being responsible for the big gap between specified targets and actual achievements. The following are the main problems and hindrances encountered in the course of implementation of programs a) \\tMost of the power projects have to rely on one or more than one source(s) of bilateral and/or multilateral financing. As a consequence, the delays in financing and procedural arrangements have adversely effected the implementation of these projects. Efforts will be designed and developed to pre-empt the occurrence of the same problems during the Seventh Plan period. A system designed to activate the concerned agencies involved in the implementation of projects to be executed with foreign assistance in finalizing negotiations and other necessary arrangements to eliminate different proceductal delays will be developed. Likewise, arrangements to the effect that works-contracts are finalized only after the identification and selection of the right and capable contractors will also be developed. In order to achieve a satisfactory rate of progress in the Seventh Plan period, especial emphasis will be occurred to enhance both the technical expertise and the implementation capacity. In addition to above mentioned problem, a number of difficulties arising from the following factors were also encountered in the course of implementation: a) \\tPre-feasibility and feasibility studies of projects sufficient in numbers and different in kinds (eg those based on run -of -the and/or reservoir) have to be completed so that there is a large enough so that there is a large enough choice to choose from at th3e implementation stage and so that power can be generated at relatively cheap costs. b) \\tTransmission and distribution networks have to taken as an integral component of power-general projects and feasibility studies have to design to take the whole into consideration. c) \\tThe investme nts in power generation in power generation, transmission and generation have to be balanced to maximize the returns from the investments in the power sector. On the basis of these experiences, implementation of programs in the power sector will be based on more realistic, practical and appropriate considerations. Projection of Demand The Peak demand for fiscal year 1983/84 was calculated at 1,31,760 kw by the Fifth Plan and at 1,93,000 kw by the Sixth Plan. In comparison to this projection, the peak-demand reached 76,000 kw in areas cover by the unified electricity system and 16,000 kw in other areas to total of 92,000 kw in fiscal year 1983/84. Total hydropower generating capacity in the central unified system has reached 1,25,986 kw, but the utilization has been only 60 percent of this generating capacity. Good return from projects can be expected if the projected demand for power-supply prove to be realistic. These consideration again reinforce the need to make projection as realistic as possible. Projecting accurately the demand for electricity is indeed a difficult proposition. It is desirable to up-date the projections on a regular basis especially in view of the complications involved in, and the importance of these projections. Whereas the graph representing projections on demand and supply of electric power presented in appendix 2. On the basis of these projections, the demand for electric energy will increase at an annual rate of 13.9 percent and the peak demand for electricity power will increase by 13.6 percent during the Seventh Plan period (1985/90). In the fiscal year 1984/85 which was the last year covered by the Sixth Plan, demand for electric energy and for electric power was respectively 492.2 gegawatt/hour and 115.6 megawatt whereas the present whereas the present projections suggest these to reach 943.4 gegawatt/hour and 218.9 megawatt by fiscal year 1989/90 which is the last year covered by the Se venth Plan. Steps Needed to Increase Power Consumption Though the increase in power consumption indicate an increase in the pace of economic activities and the supply electricity facilities to a greater number of the population, it has become necessary to devote attention to the measures which can lead to an increase in the demand for electricity, especially in view of the fact that there was significant shortfall in the actual demand for electricity in comparison to the projected estimates even though the power generating capacity was there in the country. As already stated, increase in power consumption can directly contribute to the economic development endeavors in the country. However, the following factors seen to be responsible for slowing down the target of increase in the demand for power supply. a) \\tInadequate expansion of the transmission and distribution lines, b) \\tLack of expected increase in demand for power in productive sectors especially in sectors such as industry, agriculture, tourism, transport and others; and, Thus, in this situation, the following steps are necessary to increase the demand for electric power. Produce cheap electric power: It has become necessary to reduce, to the extent possible, the outlays involved in the production of electric -power, its transmission and distribution. The step in this direction is the identification of the right project and this has received ample emphasis in the policy measure enunciated in the Seventh Plan. In general, big projects tend to be more economic. But as the power generated by big projects likely to be fully consumed only domestically, efforts and studies identifying export possibilities of surplus power will have to be continued. Producting electricity at relatively cheap costs will help conserve forests to a certain extent by increasing the demand and consumption of electric power and will also result in substituting the imports of costly petroleum. However, to produce electric power relatively cheaply it is necessary to enhance the level of national technical expertise and to expand gradually the production of goods and materials such as wires and cables, poles and other like equipment necessary for power projects. 1. Increase the Demand of Power in other Productive Sectors Electric power is an essential infrastructure for the development of productive sectors such as industry, tourism, transport, agriculture and other. However, formulation and implementation of different plans to increase the demand of electricity from these sectors seem to be required. This will lead to an increase in the production of the country in addition to an increase in the utilization of electricity Thus, in this context, electricity tariff rates will be revised to attract and encourage these sectors to use electric power to a greater extent. 2. Revise the Electricity-tariff Rates Revision to encourage higher utilization of electricity has to be effected in the present tariff structure rate, which discourages higher consumption by charging progressive higher charges. If changes in the present tariff structure are made to this effect then the domestic and other sector will substitute other kinds of imported fuel for electricity and this will result in a significant increase in electricity consumption. 3. Increase Investment in Transmission and Distribution Systems It is not possible to increase the demand for electricity simply by increasing the power generation capacity but it is also essential to deliver the generated power to the customers to increase the effective demand. The policy to increase and balance investments in transmission and distribution systems will be adhered to in the plan period. Thus, extension, improvements and necessary electrification activities to strengthen the distribution on system will be undertaken promptly as will be the construction of extension lines. 4. Study of the Internal Market Studies aiming at the full utilization of presently generate electrical power and at increasing the demand in internal market will be undertaken. Objective 1. To meet the increasing needs of different sectors such as industry, agriculture, commerce and transport and others by generating power from water resources available in the country. 2. To augment the development of cottage industry and of agriculture through the generation of power from small hydel projects in rural areas where the possibilities of supplying electricity facilities from big power projects do not exit. 3. To conserve the ever-decreasing forest area and to reduce the use of imported fuel materials by encouraging the different sectors of the economy to use electricity more extensively and by expanding its supply. Policy 1. Projects adjudged appropriate will be executed to meet the long term and the medium term power supply needs of the country. An inventory of hydro -electricity projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects deemed attractive from an economic point of view. 2. Unified transmission system will be established by linking power generating centers to supply electricity in the main areas of consumption to ensure the development of regular and reliable distribution system. 3. Electrification programs will be made more extensive to augment the development and expansion of agricultural production and of cottage and small-scale industries in the Mountaineous and the Terai regions of the country. For the implementation of these programs, small hydel plants will be developed whereas electrification can not be provided through the unified transmission system. 4. Research and studies on the technical and management aspects will be undertaken with the aim of reducing the construction and operational expenditures of small hydro-electricity projects. Working Policies 1. Priority will be accorded to the implementation of projects carried over from the Sixth Plan. 2. With the objective of producing electricity of cheap rates, projects identified as being attracted on the basis of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies will be implemented. 3. Especial importance will be accorded to extend the unified electricity system to supply electricity generated by different centers to the more area of consumption. 4. Expansion and strengthening of the distribution system will be stressed in view of the reality that it is possible to ensure adequate returns from past investments if the distribution system at different power generating centers are not sufficiently extended and strengthened. 5. Electrification programs will be implemented tin the district head quarters and other places of other places of the country to maximize the utilization of limited resources on the basis of the following consideration: i. \\tarea with economic potentials, ii. area with possibility of underground and pump irrigation and the development of cottage and small scale industries, iii. area adjoining areas where electrification works have already been completed, and iv. area in proximity of hydro -electricity generating plant. 6. Studies and other measures will be undertaken to reduce the construction, operation and maintenance costs of projects. 7. The survey and design phases will receive special attention in the construction of small hydel plants. In addition, the possibility maximum mobilization of local labour and other resources will also be taken into consideration while generating electrical power. 8. To develop and expand the production capacity of mechanical equipment necessary for micro and mini hydeo-electricity projects and other goods and equipment necessary for electrification process and to improve the quality of these products, discussions and negotiations with the local manufacturing firms will be held on a regular basis and necessary incentives will also be provided to them. 9. No projects without finalizing the total project costs and the sources of financing will be included in the annual program. 10. Arrangement to ensure that contracts are awarded only to the capable and qualified contractors will be devised and if demand necessary, a system whereby tenders are accepted from identified and selected contractors only will also be implemented. Power Development Program Projects to be implemented under this program in the Seventh Plan are classified along the following lines: b) \\tSmall Hydro-electricity Projects c) \\tConstruction and Extension of Transmission Lines d) \\tElectrification e) \\tStrengthening of the Electricity System f) \\tSurveys and Feasibility Studies a) Large Hydro-electricity Projects Construction of Kulekhani Hydro-electricity Project, Phase II (32,000 kw), Marsyangdi Hydro-electricity Project (66,000 kw) and Andhhi Khola Hydro-electricity Project (5,100 kw) which are presently under construction and which have been carried over from the Sixth Plan to the Seventh Plan, will be completed during the Seventh Plan. Construction of this Project was started in fiscal year 1983/84 as this project was found to be economic and attractive and as the financing arrangements could also be completed for the implementation of this project. It is expected that this project can be completed by fiscal year 1986/87. This project, under construction at an estimated cost of Rs 710 million, will use water of the Kulekhani I Project through a 6 km long tunnel in addition to the water resource of Mandu river which is a tributary of Gandaki. The installed capacity of this project will be 32,000 kw and it is expected that this project will generate electricity upto 104.6 million kilowatt/hour a year. This Project formulated to utilize the water resources of Marsyangdi river was included in the Sixth Plan with the hope that it will be completed by the end of the plan period. At the financial arrangements are at a finalization stage now, this project has been included in the Seventh Plan and it is expected that it will be completed during the plan period. Located at 110 km west to Kathmandu at Aabu Khaireni this project will produce electricity up to 462.5 million kilowatt/hour per year by utilizing the water resources of Marsyangdi river through 7,500 meters long tunnel. The installed capacity of this project will be 66,000 kw. iii. Aandhi Khola Hydro-electricity Project The construction of this project at Aandhi Khola river was started in fiscal year 1981/82 and it is expected to be completed by fiscal year 1987/88. Located at Gallyang pass, 80 km south to Pokhara, this project will use the water of Aandhi Khola will have an installed capacity of 5,100 kw with annual electricity production capacity of 20.1 million kilowatt/hour. This project is being constructed by the Butwal Power Company under the assistance of United Mission to Nepal in addition to some investment from His majesty\\'s government Construction of sixteen small hydro-electricity projects have been carried over from the Sixth Plan to the Seventh Plan and these projects are scheduled for completion during this plan period. These projects are scheduled for completion during this plan period. These projects include those at Taplejung (125 kw), Khandwari (250 kw), Tehrathum (100 kw), Bhojpur (260 kw), Namche (480 kw), Salleri (200 kw), Okhaldhunga (125 kw), Ramechhap (75 kw), Manang (80 kw), Chame (40 kw), Tatopani, Myagdi (1000 kw), Chaurjahari (200 kw), Syarpudaha (150 kw) Bajura (200 kw) and at Darchula (50). c) Construction and Extension of Transmission Line Construction of five 132 kv transmission line projects to a total length of 731 km and of another five 33 kv line projects to a total length of 258 km which were either under construction phase or fast approaching this phase during the Sixth Plan will be completed in this plan period. In addition to the construction of this 989- km of transmission lines , construction of additional transmission lines of 33 kv, including transmission line of Nepalgunj-Mahendraganar and lines to other consumption centers, to a length of 350 km will also be completed during this plan period. 33 kv transmission line construction projects will also be implemented under the district plan. d) Electrification In the course of extending the supply of electricity, electrification project, the construction of which were still in complete by the end of the Sixth Plan, will be taken up and completed in this plan period. In addition, electrification extension program will be implemented with a view to promote the development of cottage industry and to encourage the use of electricity by other industries while, at the same time, aiming at increasing the irrigation potentials of underground water through the supply of electricity in areas in proximity to the planned east to west 132 or 33 KV transmission line spanning the whole length ofr the entry and inother rural areas in the mountains and the Terai. Electrification programs at the district level will also be undertaken under the District the District Plan. The following projects, designed to improve the electricity supply system and to make the supply system more regular in addition to checking leakages, have been included for implementation during the Seventh Plan period. i. : As a load dispatch center has become essential for smooth operation of the electricity system especially in view of the fact that both Marsyangdi Hydro electricity Project and Kulekhani II are scheduled for completion during the plan period, hence, the construction of a load dispatch center will be taken up and completed with the plan period. ii. Strengthening the supply center: Distribution system of Biratnagar-Janakpur, Pokhara and Nepalgunj supply centers will be strengthened in addition to improving the capacity of Pokhara sub-center. In addition to these, these, distribution system of the town area in Hetauda-Birgunj and Bhairahawa0-Krishnanagar will also be improved. F. Survey, Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering Study b) \\tEconomic and technical feasibility study: Feasibility Study of Arun III: A project which has been identified as being attractive from the Koshi river basin master plan and the final feasibility study of Saptagandaki will be completed on a priority basis. In the context of regional development, feasibility study of Seti (west) hydroelectricity project will be undertaken. In addition, feasibility study of run of the river project, from among the projects already studied or to be studied in the near future, and which suits the national supply system will also be completed. Likewise, detailed survey of Mulghat hydro-electricity project will also be completed Study on a 10,000 kw project on the Jhimaruk river to supply electricity to district headquarter of Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Phythan, Rolpa and other mountainous districts of the Western and Far-western development region will be completed and the project will be implemented if found feasible. Necessary arrangement to construct the most feasible one from among these two projects will also be made. 2. Small Hydro-electricity Project: The following programs have been included under this in the plan period. a) Projects with less than 100 kw generating capacity The preliminary studies will be undertaken as a form of technical assistance to the private sector. To assist the private sector, an annual on the appropriate structure and standard equipment needed for the construction of such projects will also be published in a way which can be used even by the general public. In addition, financial loan assistance and other technical assistance will also be available for such construction purposes. b) Projects with generating capacity from 100 kw to 500 kw will be identified and feasibility study of projects from among these will be taken up. Under this program feasibility study of a hydro-electricity project in Myagdi and Aruntar hydro -electricity project in Gorkha will be taken up and a project will also be constructed if found feasible. 3. Survey of Transmission Lines In addition, to this transmission line will be completed. In addition, survey of a 500 km long 33 kv transmission line to supply to different centers of consumption from the 132 kv transmission line stretching from the east of the country to the west will also be completed. Survey for the establishment of a 132/33 kv capacity substation in Lahan will also be completed in addition to the task listed above. c) Miscellaneous Multipurpose Projects Multipurpose projects are those projects based on reservoirs which can supply irrigation water and help flood- control in addition to the generation of electricity. Kankai, Bagmati, , Karnali (Chisapani) and Pancheshwore (Mahakali) projects fall under this category. Especial priority will be accorded to develop projects like Karnali (Chisapani) and Pancheshwore (Mahakali) which have potentials to export electricity from among the projects listed above. In addition, efforts will also be made to implement other Pro jects like Karnali and Bagmati. District Level Projects Under the Decentralization Plan Projects related with electrification and extension, system improvement, construction of 33 kv line transmission lines and related with operation of diesel plants, are all projects at the district level. A total sum of Rs 644.5 million has been allocated for these projects by the Seventh Plan. Expenditures allocated for the development of the power sector by the Seventh Plan presented ads follows: Chapter 38 (B) ALTERNATIVE ENERGY Introduction At present, the per capita consumption of energy in  is 224-kg oil equivalent of which about 94 percent is met from traditional sources of energy and the remaining 6 percent from modern commercial fuels. Price increase of the POL products in 1973/74 and in 1979/80 and the consequent crisis affected  as well and, indeed, led to a slow down in the pace of development in addition, to the adverse effects on the balance of payments. But despite these effects, the important of petroleum products has been increasing every year mainly because the expansion of development programs, promotion of a number of commercial and industrial establishments and increase in the number of vehicles. On the other hand, forests are being denuded in the uncontrolled manner mainly for the supply of fuelwood and timber and for resettlement purposes. In this connection, programs which aim at the development of bio-gas, solar and wind-power distribution of improved Chulo to conserve fuel-wood installation of cross-flow turbine and multipurpose power unit in the conventional water mill to increase its horse-power, research and analysis to identify cheap alternative source of energy and at providing necessary incentives to their producers, have to developed and implemented. The proposed outline for the development of alternative sources of alternative sources of energy has been developed taking into consideration all these factors. Review of the Sixth Plan Sixth Plan had aimed at developing arrangements to provide necessary assistance and to facilitate programs designed at research and analysis of cheap alternative sources of energy and to programs designed to increase the productio n of these sources of energy. However, the government sector could not provide the necessary assistance and support to these activities. In the area of forest conservation and tree planting, conservation and planting activities in addition to the distribution of improved Chulo were undertaken under the community forest development project and some other projects. Around 1620 bio-gas plants, at the family and community level, have been constructed in addition to the installation of 250 cross-flow turbines and multipurpose water-mills which have provided at concessional rates directly to the farmers and through the small farmers development projects by the Agricultural Development Bank under the loan assistance of Asian Development Bank. Of this total demand, 93 percent is estimated to be accounted by domestic uses, 3 percent by commercial and industrial sector, 3 percent by transport sector and the rest 1 percent by other sectors. Actual energy use by different sectors and projected estimat es are presented in the following tables: In total consumption of energy, consumption of petroleum products, electrical-power, coal and lignite, fuel-wood and other traditional resources of energy is estimated as follows: Objective 1. To meet the energy needs and to reduce the dependence on traditional sources of energy through the development of alternative sources of energy. 2. To encourage the wide spread use of improved and appropriate techniques to reduce the consumption of fuel- woods by the domestic sector. 3. To develop and expand the use of productive techniques through appropriate improvements in the traditional techniques in rural areas, especially in the context of the use of hydro-energy. Policy 1. To encourage the development of alternative sources of energy, especially to the development of bio-gas plants, solar and wind energy and to accord a greater importance to the role of the private sector in this area. 2. To expand the distribution and use of improved Chulo in an extensive manner with appropriate encouragement to the private sector to the private sector to reduce consumption of fuel-woods. In addition, research will also be undertaken to develop techniques designed to reduce the consumption of fuelwoods. 3. To undertake research activities to develop and construct cheap and appropriate bio-gas plants to suit the different climatic conditions of the different parts of the country. 4. The use of small water turbines and of improved water mills will be propagated and encouraged on a wide-scale in the rural areas, especially to augment the development of agriculture and cottage industry and to supply electricity to these areas. Working Policy 1. Necessary assistance and incentives as may be justified will be provided to encourage the involvement of the private sector in the development and expansion of use of alternative sources of energy and to make the role of the agencies and institution involved in this area more effective. 2. Necessary encouragement and incentives will be provided to the concerned agencies in researches directed towards the development of cheap, practical, simple and more productive techniques in the use of alternative sources of energy. 3. Highest priority will be accorded to the production and distribution of bio -gas plants, improved Chulo and improved water mills as there is a great potential to increase there uses. 4. Data will be collected and analyzed and the available techniques propagated in an applied basis to develop solar energy and wind energy. 5. The use of local skill and technology, labour and resources will be encouraged in the development of alternative sources of energy. 6. Research, surveys and studies will be undertaken to develop alternative sources of energy. Likewise, technical manpower will be developed through the mechanism of imparting training to the local people. The following programs in the area of development of alternative sources of energy, energy conservation, energy substitution and in the area of research and analysis in the use of alternative sources of energy have been identified for implementation during the Seventh Plan. 1. Establishments of Bio-gas Plants Gas from these bio-gas plants can be used for cooking purposes, for lighting purposes, for operating small mills for processing agricultural products and for electrification. Another important and very useful product for thes e plants is the high quality organic manure. Bio -gas plants can be expected to contributed positively in the improvement of the environment in addition to usher pleasant changes in domestic life by providing clean, easy and smokeless sources of energy. Thus, a provision to sell these plants at 25 percent less than the production cost and to provide the differential in the production and the sales price to the producer in the form of a grant will be implemented. This grant to the producers has been calculated on the basis of savings accruing to the government through less use of fuel woods which will be thew case if the bio-gas plants are used. During this plan period, a total of 4,000 bio-gas plants will be established throughout the Kingdom, the breakdown of which on a fiscal year basis is provided as follows: In addition, regular review and evaluation of this program will also be undertaken. The activities undertaken by different agencies will also be coordinated. Under this program, improved Chulo will be distributed in  and other district facing fuelwood shortage free for charge. If these water mills could be improved to produce even only 10 kw each then an addition 250 mw of power could generated. In present context, the private sector is manufacturing multipurpose power unit (MPPU) and cross-flow turbines of different capacity and these have the potential of substituting the use of traditional water mills. In addition, these turbines and water mills produce more power that the traditional water mills, can process a more diversified ranged of agricultural products and can even generate electricity for distribution to the immediate neighborhood. A system to subsidies 10 percent of the total installation charge will be developed to promote the use of multipurpose power unit and cross flow turbines. In addition the practice of making available loans at concessional rates from the Agricultural Development Bank will be continued. It is estimated that during the Plan period, 640 multipurpose power units (on an average, 5 horse-power) and 320 cross flow turbines (10-20 horse power) will be installed and HMG will have to provide grants to the tune of Rs 4.8 million. The scientific use of solar and wind energy has to be accepted as being negligible upto now in  despite the fact that the development of these sources of energy can be important sources of energy supply. In the area of solar energy, the private sector has been involved in the manufacture of solar water-heaters and driers. However, as the process of transforming solar energy to electrical power involves relatively high costs we are yet to come to a stage where this technique can be used by the general people Though the scientific use of both solar and wind energy is very limited in the present context, it is necessary to collect data and information in these area and to analyze them right from now on in view of the potential role of these sources of energy in future. This, in this context, a program to establish around twenty stations with equipment to measure solar heat and wind speeds is expected to be implemented during the Seventh Plan. To the extent possible, this equipment will be installed in hydrology and meteorology related stations. The private sector will be provided with necessary incentives to promote and develop the use of solar energy, especially to encourage a more extensive and wind spread use of useful technologies, such as the solar water heaters and driers. In addition, programs will be implemented to encourage the use of this source of energy to develop irrigation and cottage industry in those areas, which are short of other sources of fuel. Appropriate steps will also be initiated to develop this source of energy on the basis of surveys, studies, data collection and analysis and of the existing techniques. At amount of Rs2.5 million has been earmaked for the implementation of this program. 5. Research and Development There are numerous research and development opportunities in the area of alternative source of energy as this is a relatively new field. Though there are a number of government, semi-government and private agencies involved in these activities, research and development works have not progressed much mainly because of shortage of necessary financial resources, lack of coordination and the lack of specified goals. In this background, the Seventh Plan addresses itself to improving these identified deficiencies. to be more specific priority will be accorded to the research and development works in the following areas: i. \\tdesigning of less expensive solar water heater, cooker and direr, ii. designing of less expensive and more effective bio-gas plants and developing techniques which will ensure the same quantity of gas even in winter season, iii. designing of further improved Chulos, iv. designing of residential house which can maximize the use of solar heat, and v. development of less-expensive, simple and easy to operate water mills and other water based equipment. A total Rs 3.2 million has been ear-marked for this program. 6. Training Program on Alternative Sources of Energy The fact that the private sector has played a significant role in the development of alternative sources of energy, in energy conservation and in substituting the conventional sources of energy, in energy conservation and in substituting the conventional sources of energy has already been mentioned earlier. In addition, to measure directed at providing tax and customs rebate to the private sector, measure to improve the productivity of the workers engaged in this areas are also equally important to implement. A total sum of Rs 2.0 million has been earmarked for this training program. Allocation of expenditure for the different programs to be implementd in the area of development of alternative sources of energy during the Seventh Plan is as follows: CHAPTER 38 (C) WATER AND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT Introduction In the present context, it has become essential to accelerate the pace of irrigation development to increase agricultural production and to increase the generation of power through the development of water resource. As mostly the government agencies are involved in the task of increasing the use of water resources, it was felt necessary that the activities of these agencies have to be well coordinated with clear and specific goals and a proper guideline has to be enunciated. In addition, arrangements have been made for this Commission to be chaired by the Minister for Water Resources. A permanent Secretariat with experts in related fields has also been established for effective operation. It has become necessary to identify and develop programs for implementation by this Commission during the Seventh Plan as this Commission has significant potentials in carrying out studies, research and analysis, exploration and project formulation related tasks and in providing technical advice for the development of water resources. Review of the Sixth Plan The secretariat of the Water and Energy Commission has been involved in extending assistance in formulation of water resource and energy related projects, collection of basic data, research and standardization, determination of existing manpower, preparation of project profiles of different project, study of investment outlays for different projects, study on the allocation of investment and their benefits of large projects, evaluation of the general impact of such projects and in conducting studies on the development of alternative sources of energy. In addition, the Secretariat has also been involved in the development of an economic impact model for water resource, in the application of the basic assumption of this model and in studies on national and international laws related to Nepal and of international arguments on, and management of, these laws have also been going on. Canadian government is involved in extending assistance to the Secretariat. Efforts will be directed at further strengthening the Secretariat during the Seventh Plan. 1. To facilitate the planned and rapid development of water resources by coordinating the activities of all the concerned agencies and by providing specific guide lines. Policy 1. Efforts to coordinate the activities of the agencies involved in water resource and energy sectors will be continued further. 2. National laws and rules and regulations related to water resource and energy will be devised and developed and programs will be formulated on detailed surveys and exploitation, studies on present and future needs, resource conservation and development and long and short -term projects related to the water resource utilization of the county. 3. Guidelines will be developed to rend3er project formulation, identification, selection and operation and maintenance costs less expensive but more effective on the basis of evaluation and study of current practices 4. Necessary advice, suggestion, and recommendations will be provided to His Majesty\\'s Government on policy measures and plans on water resource and energy. Total sum of Rs 5.6 million has been earmarked for the programs of Water and Energy Commission to be implemented during the Seventh Plan period. CHAPTER 38 (D) ENVIRONMENT The objective conditions of land, water living organisms and biosphere, their pattern of utilization and interactions can be defined to constitute the environment as such. The developmental activities organized by human beings are indeed an integral part of the environment. Likewise, a close relationship subsists between land-use and environment. The changes made by man on land-use patterns tend to affect the ecosystem which in itself can affect the welfare of mankind. These consideration leads to the conclusion that environment has to be included as a determinant in the developmental efforts of human beings. In the developed countries, environmental problems seem to originate from industrialization and modernization, whereas in a country like Nepal these problems can be attributed to ignorance, poverty and the rapid growth in population. maintenance of a balanced ecological system seems to get more and more difficult especially as the rapid increase in population pressure and rapid expansion of developmental activities seem to cause denudation of forests, land-erosion, floods, drying-up of water sources and shortage of fuel woods, grass and other like sources of energy. In addition, industrialization, modernization, and tourism development also seem to be contributing to ecological disturbances. The main objective of environment management will be to mitigate the adverse effects of the mentioned factors and to maintain a balanced environment. In addition, proper land-use patterns and a sound environment management system are the basic per-requisites to control the process of desertification, to increase land-productivity and to implement balanced development plans. In short, proper land-use patterns and sound environment management are the essential preconditions to improve the general welfare of the people. It is believed that the measures initiated during the Sixth Plan have helped in checking further deterioration of the environmental conditions on the one hand and in developing a sound base for formulation and implementation of policies directed at the maintenance of a sound and balanced environment. Formation of the Department of Soil and Water Conservation and of the Department of National Parks and Wild -life Conservation are the results of some of the steps taken by His Majesty\\'s Government. Likewise, implementation of integrated rural development projects, watershed management, community forest development and other projects with afforestation component have contributed positively to the forest development program while the establishment of a Remote Sensing Center has helped generate data on environmental status. In this background, the establishment of Mahendra Nature Conservation Fund and the establishment of International Center for Integrated mountain development (ICIMOD) with the assistance of UNESCO and other friendly countries can be expected to play a significant role, the latter not only in Nepal but also in regional context, in the conservation and development of a balance environment. Study project on environmental impacts was also taken up by the Department of Land and Water Conservation during the second year of the Sixth Plan. This Project has been involved in drafting a national policy and legal measures on environmental conservation, in study and evaluation of the impacts of developmental programs on environment and in organizing training, seminars and conferences in addition to publication of materials on conservation of nature. Likewise, Nepal national Committee on Man and Biosphere has also been involved in conduction research on related issues. This Committee in fact ushered in the right atmosphere for the establishment of ICIMOD. As the formulation of a first phase national conservation policy has already been completed and the report already prepared with the assistance of IUCN, efforts to initiate works on the second phase during the Seventh Plan period are being made. The election of Nepal to the governing council of united Nations Environmental Program for a three year period starting from 1984 can also be expected to facilitate exchange and inflow of information or conservation efforts made in the international context and to mobilize external resources for conservation efforts in Nepal itself. In the above background, it has to be accepted that there are many a tasks to be undertaken in the area of land use and environment conservation but it has to be accepted that these tasks are by no means easy. Thus, formulation and implementation of programs in these areas need multi sectoral approach and a good coordination. Problems in Implementation a) \\tThe National Resources Conservation Commission, formed in the Sixth Plan to provide necessary guidelines at the national level to the concerned agencies, has not been able to function effectively as desired. b) \\tThe Sixth Plan could not arrange for the training and development of manpower and expertise in conformity with the multidimensional nature of environmental management. c) \\tStudy and evaluation programs have suffered mainly because no system has been devised and developed to specify a nationally acceptable minimum level of pollution and to develop the manpower necessary to undertake these activities. d) \\tContinued collection of data and their interpretation and research and analysis are very essential for the development of a sound environment management program. Forgoing ahead in this area has proved difficult mainly because of the absence of a central-level body to look in this area, though there are some agencies presently engaged in these activities. In the above background, the Seventh Plan has identified the following objective, policy and program for implementation in the area of environment and land use. Objective 1. To control environmental degradation caused by developmental activities and other factors and to bring about and maintain a positive relationship between development activities and environmental management. 2. To preserve the interest and welfare of the common people by reducing the level of water, air and sound pollution. 3. To maintain and develop the overall welfare of the people through conserving and strengthening the environment through a system of sound environmental management. 10. The process of conservation of important and sensitive watershed areas through afforestation, flood control and other measures will be continued. Program 1. Necessary steps will be taken to further strengthen the present National Natural Resource Conservation Commission so that the Commission can play a more effective role in maintaining a proper balance between man and natural resources and environment. 2. Necessary arrangements will be made guidelines on these arrangements will be prepared in conformity with the policy to incorporate elements of environmental factors right from the formulation stage of developmental plans and projects so that there are no adverse effects of these plans projects on the ecological system. In addition, studies to evaluate the effects of industrial, tourism, water-resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental programs on environment will also be undertaken. 3. Scientific research and analysis will be continued in an unceasing and effective manner in areas related to resources conservation and development in addition to specifying a minimum standard of environmental cleanliness. 4. Pilot projects exhib iting balanced environment of different geographical and ecological regions of the country will be implemented. 5. Exchange of information and knowledge on major achievements in the area of resources conservation and management will be promoted at an international level by establishing and developing relations with the concerned agencies. 6. The present rules and regulations on resources conservation and utilization will be implemented effectively in addition to formulating acts on conservation of national ecology and environment. 7. Study of environmental aspects will be made compulsory at the school and college levels and necessary steps to prepare a syllabus and textbook in this subject will also be taken. 8. Study and training opportunities, both within the country and outside, will be developed to develop necessary manpower on resource conservation, utilization and management. 9. A report on the status of environment will be prepared during the Seventh Plan period in addition to the preparation of a yearly report on the quantity of natural resources and environmental situation at a regional and the national level. 10. Individuals, social institutions and organizations, non-governmental agencies, class organizations and local panchayats will be encouraged to be more active and necessary arrangements to award reco9gnitions and assistance as incentives will also be made. 11. Classification of land on the basis of national land-use policy will be started. 12. One of the fiscal year covered by the Seventh Plan will be designated as environment year and activities will be conducted in a manner specified by the programs of this year, especially with a view to ensure effective and timely implementation of programs on ecological balance and environment management by the concerned agencies. Education and Culture For example, establishment of technical schools and efforts made to produce low, medium and high level manpower can be cited. Main achievements made during the plan period are as follows: Programme Review of the Sixth Plan Comparing the situation of primary, lower secondary and secondary education in the final year of the Fifth Plan 1979/80 with the final year of the Sixth Plan 1984/85, it becomes clear that the number of school, students and teacher at all the three levels has increased satisfactorily. Annual statement about this is given in the attached table. It increased by 39 percent to 1,833,655 students by the final year of the Sixth Plan. This is about 78 percent of the children of primary school going age, 6-10 years. The main causes of this increase in the number of primary school children are the provision of free primary education, free distribution of text books up to grade III and rise in public consciousness in favour of education. In FY 1979/80, female enrollment was 26.7 percent of total student enrollment. The figure fose 28.8 percent by the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, 1983/84. The number of teacher is estimated to have increased from 28,353 in FY 1979/80 to 44,616 in FY 1983/84. Student in lower secondary school is estimated to reach 266,639 in FY 1984/85. This is 35 percent of the children of school going age. Female student enrollment at this level in FY 1979/80 was 20 percent. This figure reached 23.9 percent in FY 1984/85. Of 10,590 teachers at lower secondary level in FY 1983/84, 41.4 percent were trained. In FY 1983/84, teacher-student ratio is 1:23. By FY 1984/85, 55.6 percent of the total number of 6294 teachers at this level were imparted training. At this level, teacher-student ratio is 1:34. In FY 1979/80, the number of school was 785. By the final year of the Sixth Plan, the figure is expected to reach 1280. One of the main reasons for the non-fulfillment of target was that the population growth rate proved to be 2.66 percent according to the report on 1981 census despite the previous estimate of 2.3 percent at the start of the plan period. With the objective, school cooperation committee has been changed into school managing committee with additional responsibilities. (b) Efforts for Qualitative Improvement of School Education Various programmes and projects were undertaken during the Sixth Plan period for improving the standard of school education. An education project was launched in Seti Zone with a view to bring about qualitative improvement in education by adopting new techniques for various aspects of education, such as, teachers\\' training and supervision, curriculum design, preparation of text books and education materials. Science education project was started in order to make provisions for imparting science education of good standard by improving the teaching and learning process in science, mathematics and English subjects. Similarly, primary education project was undertaken to improve the quality of education at this level. Primary education is the foundation stone of higher education. Besides, programmes in conformity with educational policies are underway to increase the number of trained teachers, to improve curriculum, education materials and examination system to establish the process of developing new education programmes, methods and techniques on the basis of studies and research, to reduce educational losses, to make arrangements for sufficient education materials, to consider population while establishing schools and to improve other physical facilities. A special programme has been launched to fulfill the need for teachers in remote districts. (c) Technical Education There were programmes in the Sixth Plan to establish trade schools in Lahan, Dhankuta and Jumala to start secondary level technical school in the Dharan Campus of Engineering Institute, to open lower secondary level technical schools in Sifal (Kathmandu), secondary level technical school in Sanothimi (Bhaktapur), and Technical Schools in Karnali, Bheri, Seti and Rapti Zone and in Mustang, Kaski, Solukhumbu and Jiri and to convert Butwal Technical Institute and Balaju Mechnical Training centre into technical Schools. Besides, the mechanical training centre in Balaju has been converted into trade school. (d) Activities Relating to Art, Culture and Sports Development. Royal Nepal Academy has been conducting music and dance training in Kathmandu, collection and exhibition of fine arts in Birendra Kla Bhavan, cultural \\'Mahotsav celebrations\\' Publication programmes, etc. to uplift and propagate Nepali art and culture. Cultural Corporation has also been making substantial contribution in organizing cultural programmes. Archaeological works are underway for the renovation and preservation of historical and cultural monuments in Kathmandu and Patan Durbar Squarre, Gorkha Durbar Square, in Swayambhu, Boudhnath and in various parts of the country. Surrounding environment are also being improved. Priority has been assigned to place beyond Kathmandu Valley. Covered hall are under construction in Nepalgunj, Sankhuwasabha, Baitadi and Bhojpur, During the plan period, first and second national sports contest was held and the first Asian sports contest was also organized. When the achievements of the Sixth Plan are analyzed, it becomes clear that physical facilities could not be provided to the desired extent for school development which is the infrastructure for the development of educational sector. There has been no progress according to target in adult education. The main reason for this is that implementation could not be effective because of the lack of proper supervision of the programmes that were under way. Background of the seventh Plan In view of the performance of the Sixth Plan described above, it is necessary to bring about substantial improvements in the educational sector of the forthcoming plan. There is still the need for active efforts to make available actual statistics on education. During this plan period, various steps will be taken for collecting, analysing and processing education statistics. Primary schools will be opened by ascertaining the need in different places. Schools already operating in the country will be studied in the districts. establishment of new schools will be encouraged on the basis of school mapping. Secondary schools will be allowed to be established in the private sector on the basis of people\\'s participation. These schools will be studied for a specific period of time and grants can be provided only on the basis of the study. Steps will be taken to improve and strengthen the implementation of the adult education programme in the seventh Plan accordingly. Arrangements will be made for girls hostel and training lady teachers with an objective to encourage female education. In order to raise the standard of education, it is necessary to make provision for teachers training. It is also necessary to generate competitive feeling among schools with this objective, some model schools will be opened during the plan period. The difficulties because of the lack of low level and basic manpower will be taken into account. Additional arrangements will be made for technical schools during this plan period. Steps will be taken for timely improvements in higher education. Following objectives, policies and programmes will be adopted with this objective in the Seventh Plan. university and campus level, to prepare skilled manpower necessary for economic development of the country, and to emphasize the qualitative improvement of educational standard. r. \\tAdditional equipment and suitable training will be arranged to bring about qualitative improvement in science, mathematics and English teaching. s. \\tPopulation education and environmental education will be integrated with formal and informal adult education. t. \\tThe school management committee will be activated to run schools according to people\\'s expectations. Participation of guardians will be obtained for making the teachers vigilant. u. Experimental activities will be undertaken to attain high quality in science and technical education. v. \\tCampus autonomy and self-reliance will be emphasised for decentralizing university administration as far as possible. w. \\tSubstantial measures will be taken to provide higher education through open media like radio and correspondence to reduce the admission pressure on campuses. 4. Objectives of Education a. The objective of primary education is to make students literate and develop their habit of remaining healthy. b. The objective of lower secondary education is to build the character of students, develop in them the feeling of dignity of labour, stimulate in them the habit of working and to prepare basis for secondary education. c. \\tThe objective of secondary education is to prepare citizens capable of marking contribution for all-round development of the country and to impart basic knowledge for obtaining higher education. d. \\tThe objective of higher education is to bring about the intellectual development of students, to prepare capable citizens and to furnish manpower necessary for various nation building works. 5. Physical Target of the Seventh Plan a. Primary education: Primary education facilities will be provided to 87 percent of primary school going age of 6-10 years. b. Lower secondary education: Lower secondary education facilities will be provided to 43 percent of children of 11-12 years age group. c. \\tSecondary education: Arrangements will be made for imparting secondary education to 36 percent of the children of 13-15 years age group. d. \\tAdult education: Illiterate adults will be made literate. About 7.5 lakh adults will be made literate. They will also be taught vocational skills. Literacy programme will be undertaken by local panchayats. The primary and adult education programme is expected to raise the literacy rate to 38.9 percent during the plan period. e. \\tTeachers training: Training will be imparted to 2895 primary teachers, 1035 lower secondary teachers and 825 secondary teacher during the Seventh Plan period. Primary teachers training will be provided to 6000 persons under the radio teaching programme and 1710 persons under the female educational training programme during the seventh plan period. 6. Priority National Priority projects a. Expansion of primary education and vocational education b. Higher education will be provided on additional technical subjects as necessary. c. \\tIn order to raise the qualitative standard of education, improvements will be brought about in teachers training programme, educational materials production programme and in the examination system. Programmes under the Seventh Plan 1. Primary education: Primary education facilities will be provided to 87 percent of the children of primary school going age (6- 10 years). Free education will be imparted to the primary children from the first to the fifth standard. For this purpose, arrangements will be made for 1000 schools and 12,838 teachers. This will raise the number of teachers to 62,143 and the number of schools to 12,704 by the end of the seventh Plan period. This fact will be duly considered and special emphasis will be placed on primary teacher training during the plan period. Programmes will be conducted accordingly. Besides, priority will be given to opening new primary schools in backward areas as far as possible. Guardians will be encourgaged to educate their children from the vary primary level. Female education will be emphasized. Thus the objective of primary education expansion will be fulfilled by the year 2000. The Seventh Plan will advance towards this direction. The programme to make primary education compulsary will be implemented on an experimental basis in some town panchayats under the activity of the panchayats themselves. Curriculum and text books for this purpose will be specified by His Majesty\\'s Government. 2. Lower Secondary and secondary education: Lower secondary school education facilities will be provided to 43 percent of the children of lower secondary school going age. Similarly, secondary education facilities will be provided to 36 percent of the children of secondary school going age. Encouragement will be given to the private sector for the establishment of schools at this level. Approvel will be given for the addition of 450 schools at lower secondary level and 900 schools at secondary level. If such schools run successfully with people\\'s participation for a specific period of time. grants will be provided by His Majesty\\'s Government. 3. Adult Education: The birth right of everybody to have the opportunity to be literate has been declared by the United Nations. UNESCO has made a Worldwide call to eradicate illiteracy by the year 2000. In this context, it is necessary to extend literacy to the adults and to impart them vocational education in addition as specified above. Illiteracy is a curse on development. It should be accepted that illiterate adult is an agent of production. In order to raise their productivity, they have to be made literate and trained in such activities as health, cottage industries, industrial skills. Their standard of living should be improved. The importance of adult education becomes conspicuous in order to carry out development efforts to villages For the fulfillment of the objective, about 7.5 lakh people ill be made literate under local panchayat literacy programmes during the seventh Plan period. Vocational adult education centres will be established in various parts of the kingdom to impart vocational education to 7.5 lakh adults. Thus a total of 15 lakh adults will be made literate. During the Sixth Plan Period, there were shortcomings in the implementation of the adult education programme. Therefore achievement lagged far behind target. In the Seventh Plan, adult education programme will be implemented under district development plan according to the system of decentralization. 4. Curriculum text books and education materials: The usefulness and effectiveness of the existing curriculum will be studied and necessary improvements will be made accordingly. In order to make curriculum more effective, its pattern will be changed. The question of making science compulasary will be considered and some vocational subjects will be introduced under optional group. Subjects relating to environment, nutrition and population education will be included in the concerned cirriculum and workshops will be arranged on curriculum to make teachers and supervisors more competent in the implementation of curriculum. The subject mater, Language and presentation will be made more interesting, more useful and more effective. For this purpose, special attention will be given to the selection of text book writers and the remuneration to be paid to them will be made more attractive. Reference matrials will also be prepared. The possible use of materrials prepared under rural development education project and similar other projects will be considered for preparing such materials. Teaching mat4rials will be prepared on physical education, handicrafts, painting, language, science and mathematics subjects for primary level from first to the third grade for distribution among primary schools. Curriculum and text book development centre will be strengthened and, for this purpose, arrangements will be made for physical facilities. 5. Supervision: Supervision is necessary for raising the quality of education, to improve the process of teaching and learning at the school level, to enhance the competence of teachers, for proper use of teaching technique and education materials and also for physical and financial resources of the school. The main responsibilities of the supervisor and to analyse the educational and other problems of schools within his jurisdiction, identify the gaps, to try to solve these problems through training and other activities, to evaluate the status of schools, to ensure the smooth flow and exchange of information between the district and the schools, etc. In order to make this process of supervision more effective and consistent, schools in the district will be grouped together and resource centre will be established. Provision will be made for one additional teacher in such resource centres and training seminars will be arranged for removing the shortcomings identified during superv ision. Such resource centres will also prepare the necessary basis for evaluating the students of the schools within its jurisdiction. The district education officer will inspect the resource centre and schools on a random basis and will recommend worthy supervisors for training, higher studies and other incentives. 6. Teacher training: In view of the fact, in - service training will be imparted to 2895 primary teachers, 1035 lower secondary teachers and 825 secondary teachers during this plan period. Besides, under the special programme 90 each of lower secondary and secondary teacher will be trained for 18 remote districts. for this purpose, quota of 18 seats each of I.Ed level and B.Ed. 7. Radio education teachers training: Teacher training through radio media will continue for in -service training of teachers below S.L.C. level for teaching in primary schools. Under this programme, 6000 under-matriculate teachers will be trained during the plan period. Offices responsible for conducting evaluating and analysing this programme will be strengthened. 8. School broadcasting and audio-visual programme. Besides text books, audio-visual materials also play an important role in making teaching effective. The subject matter can be clearly explained and it will be easy for students to understand through audio - visual media. For this purpose, slides, educational films will be brought to use. School programme and other radio programmes will also be broadcast in order to raise the quality of education. 9. Physical education and extra-curricular activity: Physical education and extra-curricular activity will be classified into compulsory, optional and extra - optional groups. Compulsory activities should be conducted by all the schools. Extra-curricular activity will consutitute the basis for rewarding the schools. Sports, cultural programmes, PT, debating and other competitions will be conducted at school, district, regional and national level. Extra -curricular programmes will be conducted in a more coordinated manner. At least, one teacher at the school level will be imparted extra-curricular training. Workshop seminars will be arranged to conduct eompulsory and optional activities. One trainer will be appointed at District Education Office in order to conduct training and extra-curricular activities at the district level.

In order to provide health services exceeding the level of health posts, community health program has been implemented. During the Sixth Plan period, this programme as implemented in 13 districts according to target. For this purpose, 3400 workers have been provided training during the plan period as against the target of 3000 workers. By the end of the Fifth Plan period, integrated community health program was implemented fully and partially in 23 districts. The integrated programme has not been implemented in the additional districts on a district wide scale as per target. In 23 districts where the programme has been implemented, 450 health posts have been converted fully or partially into integrated health posts. Further, 2 district public health service offices and 3 regional training centres have been established as per target. Following past plans, the Sixth Plan also emphasized the development of preventive health services. There was the target to reduce the number of malaria victims to one per thousand by the end of the plan period. Achievement is estimated to have been reduced it to 1.4 per thousand. Because of the malaria epidemic in South Asian region,  has also been affected and the number of malaria victims has increased. Further, 67,208 children have been provided polio vaccine, 247,419 persons have been provided anti-measles vaccine and 22,886 persons have been inoculated against TB. During the plan period, tuberculosis treatment was provided to 15,000 patients whose spittle was found positive and children below the age of five years were given BCG vaccination. The work of identifying leprosy patients throughout the country and providing treatment to them was continued in the Sixth Plan period also. Under this, there were targets to make survey of 980,000 infants and adults, to impart health education to 2,560,000 persons and to construct regional office building in Rajbiraj, Jhapa and Janakpur. Further treatment has been made of lepers by means of ultra-modem multi- drug therapy, mobile clinics have been operated in 12 places and health technicians of various level have been imparted training relating to leprosy. For rabies control, the Sixth Plan included targets to provide antirabies vaccination, to reduce the number of stray dogs, to register domestic dogs and to commence vaccine production in the country itself. During the Plan period, programmes were conducted to register domestic dogs, reduce stray dogs and t,o provide free vaccination. Because of delay in the construction of hospital buildings and quarters, the targets of adding hospital beds have not been fulfilled. During the plan period, 15 bed hospitals were under construction in 20 districts and construction works have almost been completed in 8 places, including Darchula, Bajhang, Bajura,Jajarkot, Palpa, Lamjung, Taplejung and Panchther. In accordance with the programme to expand the capacity of existing hospitals, construction works are under way in Dhankuta, Birgunj and Bir- atnagar building. In order to develop  as a hospital of international standard, the construction of outside patient department and other related building has been almost completed and arrangements have been started for necessary equipment and appliances and for manpower training. Because of delay in construction works, the number of hospitals could not be increased and hospital beds could not be added according to specified targets. During the plan period, 675 hospital beds were added by establishing 9 hospitals and 451 beds were added in existing hospitals, thus increasing the total number of hospital bed by 1126 beds. The newly established hospitals have 15 beds in Lahan, 25 beds in Royal Military hospital, 50 beads in police hOSpItal, 67 beds in Tokha Military hospital, 110 beds in Green Pasture hospital, 50 beds on mental hospital and 250 beds in teaching hospital, 18 beds in Biratnagar and 90 beds in Eye hospitals in Dhangarhi, total 451 beds have been added in existing hospitals including the Kanti children hospital, infections disease hospital, chest clinic, Kathmandu eye hospital and those in Chitwan, Patan, Bara, Rautahat, Taulihawa, Bhairawa Kailali and Dharan. Ayurved Department was established during the Sixth Plan period to extend Ayurvedic service. There were targets to establish Ayurvedic hospitals, one each in two development regions and 50 Ayurvedic Aushadhalaya. During the plan period, 50 Ayurvedic Aushadhalaya was established and construction works were undertaken to establish a 150 bed hospital in Dang. Processing of medicine from indigenous herbs has been continued. For family planning and maternity child welfare, there were target. to reduce crude birth rate from 42 to 40 per thousand and fertility rate from 6.3 to 5. 8. For this purpose, target was envisaged to provide family planning service to 900,000 couples. This includes the progress recorded by various bodies that provide family planning services including the Family Planning Association, Maternity and Child Welfare Projects and Integrated Community Health Services Development Project. For maternity and child welfare, the targets were to provide antinatal health services to 150,000 women and post-natal health services to 1,000,000 women and children. In order to make family planning programme effective, seminars, radio programmes, publications of papers and brochures and training works were also undertaken under information and publicity programme. The population growth rate was estimated to remain at 2.3 percent during the Sixth Plan period. The census of 1981 revealed the rate to be 2.66 percent during the 1971-81 decade. In order to control this unexpected rate of population growth, permanent vasectomy and distribution of temporary devices were emphasized and steps like wage compensation, development bonds, educational facilities and maternity leave were also implemented in this direction. Under the nutrition programme during the Sixth Plan period, 150,000 children below the age of 5 years were provided nutrition care, and under nutrition children were treated. About 11,900 children with mal-nutrition, 20,000 children with anemia, 15,500 children with diahrea and 70,971 children with worms were also provided treatment. In order to prevent goitre, throat disease and cretinism control project was established. Under this, iodine v8.ccine was provided to prevent goitre in 29 districts in Himali and hilly region where throat diseases were widespread. Further, the distribution of iodized salt has been continued. Under this, during the plan period, 47,000 quintals of iodized salt were dis tributed and three godowns and three iodine ejection plants have been established. With a view to treat blindness and other eye diseases, under the blindness control project, country -wide survey of eye diseases was undertaken and eye treatment was provided to eye patients by establishing eye hospitals, eye centres and conducting eye treatment programmes. For the treatment of the patients, arrangements have been made for the training of necessary manpower, for making available equipment and appliances and providing health education. For the prevention of junotic diseases, necessary survey was undertaken of vice encephalitis disease, blood samples of affected persons were collected for seriological test, and studies were made also of plague and poisonous snake bite. Noteworthy progress has been made during the Sixth Plan period in the production of manpower fo_ health. This has led to the increase in middle level and high level manpower. The health programmes implemented during the Sixth Plan period have exerted a favourable effect on estimated longevity, infant mortality rate and crude death rate which are the indicators of health status of the people. The target of the Sixth Plan was to reduce crude birth rate fro1l\\' 19 to 17 per thousand and infant mortality rate from 150 to 130 per thousand. Plan period, the problem relating to the mobilisation and management of construction and technical manpower has proved to be the main hurdle. These are the main problems relating to construction. For these reasons, construction works on health post, hospitals and various buildings of health organizations at central and district level have lagged behind every year. Because of hospital construction lagging behind due to delay in construction works, the work of establishing 15-bed hospitals as specified in the Sixth Plan was adversely affected. Problems have come up also in the production of higher and middle level technical manpower necessary for conducting and cohsolidating health services according to specified health post and hospital programmes. Further, because of the lack of medicines, equipment and appliances in health units, the program of providing basic health services to general public in rural areas as specified in the Sixth Plan could not be implemented effectively. Other problems relating to the development of health sector relate to management difficulties. The policies and working policies in the Seventh Plan have been designed with a view to gradually solving the problems that came up during the Sixth Plan period. However, in view of the indicators of health status of the general public, Nepalese health standard is very low as compared to the standard of developing countries. During the Sixth Plan period, some improvements have been made in this direction. It is however, self-evident that more efforts are necessary in coming years to raise the health standard of the country. The Seventh Plan envisages targets to reduce crude de[1.th rate to 12.8 per thousand and infant mortality rate to 98.3 per thousand live births and to raise average longevity to 55.4 years. For this purpose, it becomes necessary to provide effective health services in a major part of the country. While developing primal} health service, special attention will be given to the mobilization of people\\'s participation. In view of the problems that were experienced in the implementation of health projects, efforts will be made for effective implementation of programmes during the Seventh Plan period. In this context, the objective, policies and working policies of the Seventh Plan will be the following: Objective 1. To promote the physical, mental and community health of the general public and to prepare healthy manpower for the development of the country. 2. To provide the maximum number of people minimum basic health services on the basis of primary health service and to reduce death rate and increase average longevity by making available promotional, pre - ventive and curative health services. 3. To control population growth by expanding family planning programme and to improve the nutrition status by rousing popular consciousness and extending maternity and child services. Policy 1. To continue the integrated system now under way and to develop it gradually to provide ge neral medical and preventive health services to the rural people by expanding basic health services. 2. Appropriate arrangements will be made up to Panchyat and ward level in the process of institutional development to carry basic health service to the -doorsteps of the rural people. 3. In order to properly organize the incentive system for health units at different level for effective health services, gradual improvements will be made in the management system and physical facilities for hospitals at the national, zonal and district level and at health post level. Specialized services will be gradually developed in the hospitals at national level. 4. Maternity and child welfare programme will be made more widespread along with family planning service in order to control population growth in accordance with national policies and long-term goals. Equal emphasis will be given to vasectomy programme and the use of temporary devices. 5. Steps will be taken to encourage private sector to invest in the development of health service on specified policies and conditions without financial and other liability to His Majesty\\'s Government. 6. Lower level and middle level manpower for health service will be supplied as necessary for health institutions and for this purpose technical manpower will be produced by maintaining contact and coordination among concerned agencies. Working Policy 1. Health posts and Sub-posts will be developed and expanded as main medium to provide primary health service. 2. For providing general medical and various preventive health services in an integrated form through the medium of health posts, district wide integrated programme will be conducted. Accordingly, in the joint effort of integrated community development project and malaria, family planning, extended vaccine and other projects, pre-plan will be prepared for necessary manpower, medicine and equipment for districts every year where the integrated programme will be implemented. The districts where the integrated programme has been ful1y implemented will be gradually brought under the health services directorate. 3. In order to develop medical service according to incentive system, services and facilities necessary for hospitals at zonal and regional level will be specified and on its basis provisions will be made for building, manpower, medicine, equipment and appliances in package form. In order to improve hospital system, management side will also be improved. Specialist service will be developed in national level hospitals. The hos pitals at various levels will be madegradual1y self-reliant in operational matters. 4. Multi-sectoral approach will be adopted from the very beginning in multi-sided projects like family planning and nutrition. For this purpose, the system \\'of evaluating projects in concerned bodies from multisided approach will be adopted. 5. According to the principle of decentralization, the district panchayat will undertake the implementation. supervision and physical maintenance and improvement etc of projects at the district level, including health posts and sub-posts, Ayurvedic Aushadhalaya, health centre, hospitals up to 25 beds, family planning and maternity child welfare and integrated community programme. 6. In accordance with the national basic policy for the development of medical service, services of hospitals of up to 15 beds minimum will be provided. If it is sought to establish and run hospitals with people\\'s participation or private investment, permission will be given as necessary under policies and conditions specified by His Majesty\\'s Government and without financial and other liability to HMG. 7. To bring about effectiveness in the distribution and supply of medicines in public health institutions and specially in hilly and remote areas, the existing system will be improved anti the policy of involving private sector or community effort will be adopted. 8. In order to prepare and implement health plan according to the need of the district to bring about improvements in management, and to supervise and conduct the projects, health directorates will be gradually established for development regions. 9. The work of regularly supplying and distributing medicines and equipment in health institutions will be given special attention and impro vement in management will be emphasized. 10. In order to maintain healthy atmosphere in villages and to control infections and epidemic diseases, emphasis will be given to environmental soundness, pure drinking water and cleanliness. 11. Health works will be encouraged and services will be gradually made available up to the lower level. Programme Basic Health Service: Basic health service includes existing health problem and appropriate education on its prevention, knowledge about food and dieteties, drinking water and clean environment, family planning and maternity and child health service, vaccination against infections diseases, primary care of common diseases, provision of essential medicines, etc. Basic health service is being provided through the medium of health posts at present at the rural level in an integrated manner under integrated community health service development project. In those districts where the services have not been integrated, these services are being provided through different projects. The objective of gradually integrating health projects and providing basic health services will be continued in the Seventh Plan and program implemented under various projects will be gradually integrated. a) Integrated Community Health Service Development Health posts have been established in the form of basic unit of health service with a view to making available minimum health facilities to the maximum number of people in rural areas. It is estimated that by the end of the Sixth Plan period the total number of health posts in the kingdom will be raised to 794 and each district area will have a health post. In accordance with the policy to gradually integrate health posts and to provide Promotional, preventive and general health services through a single unit, 450 health posts in 23 districts are providing integrated health services so far partially and fully. Under this, family planning service, collection of blood samples of malaria patients, treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy patients are provided in an integrated form along with various vaccines to children of 0-5 years and nutrition and other services. While implementing integrated programme, the existing system of conducting in an integrated form selected health posts within the district will be ended and in the Seventh Plan integration will be adopted as a process to be implemented on a district wide scale. Accordingly, only after the various projects conducted at the district level are integrated, all the health posts of that district will make available integrated service. After the commencement of the decentralization plan, in close contact with the population and health coordination committee to be organized in district, the preparation of district health plan and health administration will be undertaken by district level units. The target of the Seventh Plan is to study the services that will be integrated while implementing the interpretation programme, the need for technical and administrative manpower following the integration programme and to implement fully integrated service in additional 27 districts in a planned way during the plan period. Thus, inclusive of the 10 districts where the integrated service was implemented during the Sixth Plan period, the integrated service will be in operation in 37 districts by the end of the Seventh Plan period. In these districts, under the integrated programme during the Seventh Plan period, family planning service, vaccination to children, vaccination against malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, nutrition and other services will be made available. According to the programme to impart training to health technicians under health posts, training of community health cadres will be conducted at the ward level. In order to make available to the rural people less expensive and effective health services in the context of mobilizing people\\'s participation, the Seventh Plan has programmes to establish sub-health posts in addition to health posts that operate at area level. Accordingly, in consolation with district panchayat, among health posts in the district one health post will be arranged as area level health post in every area. In order to make effective the health services to be provided by rural health workers at door steps at the Parichayat level, provision will be made for sub -health posts. Other health posts operating in the area will be converted into sub-health posts. Seventh Plan has the target to establish 1300 to 1400 sub-health posts of this kind during the plan period. These sub- health posts will serve as intermediatery between the area health post and the rural people and according to need, will provide service also at door steps in coordination with ward level health volunteers. While determining the site of health posts, the place with service centre will be chosen. In remote Himali and hilly districts it is difficult to establish health centre is and arrangements will be made for health sub-posts. In order to develop health service from the community level on the basis of more people\\'s participation, arrangements will be made for ward level community health cadres in districts where the integrated program has been in implementation since the Sixth Plan. Since they have been helpful in increasing health consciousness at the ward level, during the Seventh Plan provision will be made for community health cadres with priority in districts where new health sub-posts will be established as necessary. For the fulfillment of the objective to prove health services to everybody by the year 2000, community participation will be given highest role to provide primary health service at the rural level and these sub-posts will serve as intermediatery between the community and health posts. Arrangements will be made for providing primary health service at doorsteps through health cadres working at every ward of panchayat. The availability of physical facilities is very important for the effectiveness of health services. The construction of health post building was, therefore, emphasized in every plan period. The Seventh Plan has the target to 125 new health post buildings at the rate of five buildings per year. Local construction materials will be used as far as possible in constructing and maintaining health post buildings. Programmes for the development of health sector have also been included in Mahakali, Karnali, Bheri, Rasuwa Nuwakot, Sagarmatha and the Kosi Hill are integrated rural development projects. During the Seventh Plan period, buildings and residential quarters will be constructed and arrangements will be made for medicines and equipment for 19 health posts, including 7 health posts in Dadeldhura and six each in Darchula and Baitadi under the Mahakah integrated rural development project. Medicines and equipment will be provided to health posts in Jumla and Surkhet under Karnali integrated rural development project, Under the Rasuwa Nuwakot project, them am provision for constructing eight health post and residential quarters will be constructed and medicine and equipment will be provided for 19 health posts. Under Kosi hill am rural development project, building and residential quarters will be constructed for 14 health posts in Dhankuta, Bhojpur and Sankhuwa Sabha districts and arrangements will also be made for medicines and equipment. b) Program under various projects: In those districts where basic health programs have not been implemented in an integrated form health services am being available through various health projects. In the Seventh Plan also, these services will be provided through separate projects until the program is integrated. Family Planning and Maternity and On Welfare The objective of the family planning and maternity and child welfare project is to reduce the adverse effect of population growth in economic and social development of the country to control population growth in a planned way to raise the living standards of the general public and to protect the health of pregnant women and children. On the basis of the long-term objective to reduce fertility rate from 6.3 to 2.5 per thousand by the year 2000 according to national population policy, the Seventh Plan has envisaged the target to reduce fertility rate to 4.0 per thousand and the population growth rate to 1.9 percent. For this purpose 2,925,000 couples will be provided family planning service during the plan period. For this purpose, arrangements will be made to five maximum emphases on target fulfillment through mutual cooperation and coordination among the concerned agencies. The Seventh Plan has the target to make available family planning services to 1,547,100 couples including permanent vasectomy service to 300,700 couples and temporary device services to 1,246,400 couples.

Under maternity and child welfare program health services will be made available to 289.400 pregnant and delivered women. BCG, DPT vaccination will be provided to children below the age of five years and gripe water and nutrition program will also be implemented. Under this programme children particularly of the age group of 0-5 years are given vaccination against tetanus, polio measles, whooping cough and other diseases and pregnant women are given tetanus toxide. The Seventh Plan also includes provisions for survey of diseases that can be prevented by vaccination to make arrangements for cold chain in necessary places, training and supervision, evaluation, etc. BCG inoculation was the main work under the tuberculosis prevention program that has been in operation since the year 1965. Since the Sixth Plan period, emphasis was given to investigating tuberculosis patients and giving them immediate treatment. For this purpose, institutional system will be arranged for the treatment of tuberculosis patients and facilities for treatment will be provided in hospitals and health posts. It is estimated that one percent of the total population of Nepal suffer from tuberculosis and about half of them are affected by infections type of being tuberculosis. The policy of providing BCG vaccine through extended vaccine project and treatment through health units at various levels will be adopted also in the Seventh Plan. By the end of the Sixth Plan period, tuberculosis program was implemented in 31 districts. The program will be extended to additional 26 districts in the Seventh Plan. Under this program, the spittle of 548,000 suspected patients will be tested and, if the spittle is found positive, the patients will be treated and old cases under treatment, and resistant and relapse cases will also be provided treatment during the plan period. Leprosy Control Leprosy control has been in implementation as a leading program since the year 1962. This program is under way in 48 districts of Nepal. The Seventh Plan has the targets to conduct caw holding work in additional 12 districts, to apply the process of multi-drug therapy in additional 23 districts, to provide regular treatment to a minimum of 75 percent of the patients and to impart training about leprosy to health technicians at different level. Health Education During the Seventh Plan period also as in previous plan periods, various programs will be conducted to make the general public conscious of health matters, to develop the educational aspect of programs implemented in the health sector to disseminate health education and to impart health education to the general public to enable them to tender cooperation in health programs. For this purpose, various works will be undertaken, including the production and distribution of education materials, strengthening of health education training seminars, information and publicity, cooperation to other institutions, inter-sectoral cooperation, etc. Nutrition Program The nutrition program has been in implementation since the Fifth Plan with a view to improving the nutrition status of children and women. To bring about improvement in this situation, it is necessary to implement health as well as multisided programs. For this purpose, the production of nutrition food should be increased proper distribution and utilization of the production is necessary and the purchasing power of the general public should also be increased considering these facts, preliminary works was started in the final year of the Sixth Plan to conduct multi-sided program. During the Seventh Plan period, this program will be implemented in 45 districts of Nepal through hospitals, MCH clinics and health posts of integrated districts. Accordingly, the Seventh Plan has targets to supervise the nutrition status of 59,000 children and to provide mal-nutrition treatment and 3,500 children treatment against worms to 22,000 children anti-blindness treatment to 8,000 children and treatment against anemia to 7,000 pregnant women. Further training on nutrition distribution of education materials will also be undertaken. In addition to the regular program, multisided nutrition program will be implemented on a model form under joint nutrition cooperation programmes during the Seventh Plan. Medical Service In order to raise the standard of health services, emphasis has been placed on the development and expansion of preventive as well as curative services. By the end of the Sixth Plan period, the number of hospitals in Nepal reached 81 and the number of beds reached 3,772. On the basis of the population figures for the year 1985, this means one hospital for a population of 4,768 people. For the purpose of developing medical service during the Seventh Plan period, hospitals have been classified into central, regional, zonal a district hospitals. According to the level of hospitals, provisions will be made for beds, medicines, manpower, etc. the policy of making hospitals gradually self-reliant will be adopted. According to this, the management of central level hospitals will be undertaken by the all powerful managing committee working under the policies of His Majesty\\'s Government. In order to develop Bir Hospital as a national hospital at the central level, the construction works now under way will be completed during the Seventh Plan period, 200 beds will be added and specialist services will be made available.

During the Seventh Plan period, this program will be expanded, cold chain system will be applied, and the service will be expanded by providing vaccine in additional districts, indigenously produced vaccine will be used in the treatment of rabies disease. Environmental health: With the objective of reducing the incidences of disease caused by environmental pollution, the environmental health program has been in operation since the Sixth Plan period. This program includes provisions for safe drinking water, elimination of evacuated articles and refuge, inspection of polluted food items and other provisions for the prevention of pollution. The Seventh Plan provides for making arrangements for refuge pits, urinals and evacuation s, drainage system, helping maintain cleanliness in localities and streets and for necessary legislation for preventing dirt here and them, The cooperation of health posts, sub-posts and health cadres at ward level will be provided for helping in the work of maintaining personal cleanliness, for keeping hospitals and other health institutions clean and free from dirt, for maintaining environmental purity, etc. Cooperation and coordination will be brought about also in the activities of other sectors related with pollution control. Infections diseased, information, diagnose and control: The objective of this program is to save the general public from pre-mature death by controlling and preventing infections diseases, to study the status of the disease incidence, to collect statistics of differ, diseases, to develop health indicators and to provide necessary information of health status for project preparation and implementation. The Seventh Plan has programs to collect health statistics from 75 districts of the country, to make disease coding according to international practice in disease classification, to strengthen infections disease surveillance system in additional 15 districts and to implement necessary measure for preventing epidemic disease. The disabled rehabilitation program: The survey conducted in pursuance of the program of the international year of the disabled has revealed 4 percent of the total population of Nepal to be, disabled. Rehabilitation service has become necessary for most of them. The disabled rehabilitation project will be implemented during the Seventh Plan period for the rehabilitation of disabled people. The objective of this project is to identify the disabled persons at the rural and community level, to impart them education and vocational training, to provide treatment and artificial limbs and to make them capable and productive. The program will be started in Bara and Parsa, districts and extended to six districts during the plan period inclusive of Bra and Parsa. Under this, health workers will be trained, training materials will be prepared, and less expensive appliances will be produced and used. By the end of the program, about 5000 disabled persons will be provided treatment, artificial limbs and vocational training and will be rehabilitated. The private sector will be encouraged for undertaking activities to rehabilitate the disabled. Deafness control: The deafness control project will be implemented during the Seventh Plan period to prevent deafness and to enable the deaf to hear. During the Seventh Plan period, such a survey will be conducted, manpower will be provided for the treatment of the disease, and health education and preventive services will be provided for saving people from being deaf. Medical provision The main objective of this project is to make available to the general people effective medicines of good quality, to maintain standard and ensure supplies of medicines of high quality, prohibit the sale and distribution of poisonous and spurious drugs. The Seventh Plan has program to implement medical laws and rules throughout the country, to prepare and implement national medical policy, to determine the quality of imported medicines and to register them. In order to make available necessary medicines regularly to health institutions that are increasing in districts, zonal medical store will be established during the Seventh Plan period and arrangements will be made for medical supplies. Further, equipment necessary for health institutions will also be arranged by zonal medical store. Health plan This project has been in implementation since the Fifth Plan with a view to strengthening plan and program preparation of health sector, During the Seventh Plan period. Data Bank will be expanded, clearing house will be established and national health information will be developed and strengthened. Computer technology will be developed and strengthened to bring about effectiveness in program preparation and evaluation works. Provisions will be made for training studies etc. under special program to supply efficient and skilled manpower for planned development of health sector. During the Seventh Pan period, research and survey works will also be undertaken that will be helpful to health plan preparation and implementation. National health Information service: Health information service program was implemented in the Sixth Plan to make available books, papers and journals and information services necessary for enhancing the standard of research. The Seventh Plan provides for publishing documents and newsletter preparing list of articles on health, publishing articles on health and imparting training. Medical research: Medical research project has been undertaken with a view to helping in the work of strengthening health and medical services by conducting research to solve the problems that have come up or will come up in the future in medical and public -health sector. Under this project, approval will be given for research on priority basis after studying methodology, training and research proposal so as to avoid duplication in research and help bring about uniformity in research works. During the Seventh Plan Period research works will be published on various subjects relating to medicine and public health. Construction of health institutions Various problems relations to construction that came up during the implementation process in health service sector will be gradually solved. For this purpose organizational improvement in construction and maintenance during the Seventh Plan period. In order to bring about effectiveness in the construction works for health institutions located in districts, construction units will be gradually established in every regional directorate. For this purpose, arrangements will be made for technical manpower, engineering machinery and means of transportation and the related manpower will be imparted training. DRINKING WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION In view of the prime importance of the healthy manpower for the development of the country, the drinking water and sanitation programmes have been launched since the past periodic plans with the objectives of supplying the pure drinking water as the basic needs of the people and of creating the healthy manpower and clean environment. As majority of population am deprived of pure drinking water, special attention should be given to the supply of pure drinking water in view of its adverse effects on health. Though it was realized in previous plans, facility of pure drinking water could not be provided to the majority of people because of the scarcity of means and resources. In the context of our commitment to the \"Health for all by 2000\" and the \"Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, 1981-90\" need to realize drinking water projects is obvious. In view of equal necessity of environmental cleanliness for the peoples health, the sewerage and sanitation should be gradually extended within limited resources and means, specially in arm with increasing urbanization. Due priority should be given to create awareness to the need of sanitation even in the rural areas. Achievement of the Sixth Plan The Sixth Plan had targeted to provide drinking water facility to 4.13 million Population consisting of 3.87 million in rural areas and 26 million in urban areas. In the end year of the plan, it has been aimed to supply 35.718 million litres of pure drinking water per day. Of this the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage was to provide water supply to 437 thousand and the Ministry of Panchayat and local Development, to 203 thousand population. Thus during Sixth Plan period additional 1927 thousand rural population will be served with 107.343 million liters of drinking water per day and achievement will be 49.8 percent in served population and 60.4 percent in water supply. For urban population the target was to provide drinking water facility to additional 263 thousand population, while the facility extended to 222 thousand population in the first four years of the plan. OIn the final year of the plan it will be extended to another 41 thousand population and the achievement is likely to meet the target. Additional water supply in the plan period is expected to be 103.87 liters per day. This is 74.33 percent of the target. Regarding sanitation, during the Sixth Plan the provision of model low cost toilets ms targeted to saw 440 thousand population and 1500 school children, in rural areas. Within the first four years of the plan low cost sanitation facilities were provided to 15,000 populations. In the end year of the plan i.e. 1984/85, an additional 10 thousand population will be provided with this facility. In addition, by the end of the Sixth Plan the low cost sanitation facilities will be provided to 3 thousand populations through the Panchayat and Local Development ministry. Regarding sewerage facilities 313 thousand population in urban areas will receive this facility by the end of the Sixth Plan. Problems in the Plan Implementation In the Sixth Plan following problems cropped up during the implementation of the programmes, of water supply and sewerage: a. Lack of sufficient technical manpower for implementing the projects. b. Lack of financial resources. c. Lack of construction material resources and the problem of transport for the projects in remote arms. During the Seventh Plan following efforts will be made to solve these constraints: 1. Special emphasis will be given to fulfil the needs of technical manpower and to mobilise them by arranging training and up-grading training. 2. Available air services in remote areas will be utilised to transport construction materials. 3. In the execution of water supply projects necessary construction materials will be made available and the projects made economical through the mass participation of the local panchayat and the beneficiaries in their implementation. Objectives, Policies and Programme of Seventh Plan The programme to achieve \"Health for All by 2000 will be meaningful and successful only if potable water could be made available to all. So, need to accord special priority to programmes of drinking water and sanitation is quite clean In line with our commitment to the \"Water Decade 1981-90\" and incorporation of drinking water as me of the basic needs, its supply has been gradually managed within the limited resources and means. Yet, because of several problems the population covered by the facility of piped drinking water has stood at 22.4 percent only by the end of the Sixth Plan. In the Seventh Plan, it is deemed essential that programmes be implemented to provide piped drinking water facility to almost all rural people. Hence the efforts will be made to provide drinking water facility to nearly 67 percent of the country\\'s population according to the Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade targets by the end of this plan. In addition sewerage and sanitation programmes will be implemented. Objectives In the Seventh Plan, the drinking water supply and sewerage programmes have the following objectives: 1. In connection with the provision of basic necessities, drinking water facilities will be provided to majority of population. 2. To provide the sewerage system in urban arms and to communicate on environmental education in urban and rural areas. For fulfilling the basic needs of pure drinking water following policies and strategies will be adopted during the Seventh Plan to attain the above objectives. Policies 1. Efforts will be made to argument the supply of potable water which is one of the basic needs, and the programmes connected with it will be extended in scope and coverage. In this connection, priority will be given to those rural areas where water is not available. 2. Stress will be laid on the essentials of purification in drinking water projects of urban areas. 3. More co-ordination will be sought among agencies involved in drinking water projects. 4. Rural drinking water projects will be implemented more economically mobilizing local labour, skill and resource so as to benefit maximum number of people. Working Policies 1. Arrangements will be made for the operation of village level small and medium-scale completed projects through local agencies. 2. Special attention will be given to curtail the operation expenses and the construction of the physical facilities while implementing drinking water projects. 3. Emphasis will be given in the execution of drinking water projects on the basis of local participation utilising local labour skill and resources and with the support of necessary construction materials and technical help and stress will be given to construct taps, ponds and wells. 4. For the , long-term drinking water project will be designed and on its basis the programme will be implemented. 5. Emphasis will be put on the proper operation, maintenance and maximum utilization of the projects already commissioned. Pilferage will be controlled and prevented and legislative measures will also be introduced as required. 6. In prominent urban areas, sewerage system will be gradually installed and the drains of all houses will be connected with this system as far as possible through private participation. 7. Low cost waste disposal programmes will be taken up in the semi-urban areas. 8. Local panchayats will be activated to launch mass educational and informational programmes about public toilets in order for the town panchayats to run sanitation works regularly and systematically in the town areas. 9. Special attention will be given to the environmental conservation before any drinking water supply projects am implemented. 10. Due priority will be given to create awareness and to motivate people towards the necessity of hygiene in rural areas too. 11. Emphasis will be given to the distribution of private drinking water taps in semi-urban and densely populated rural areas. 12. In the distribution of public water taps specially in the mountain areas provision will be made to fix twin faucets in one tap using pressure action faucets in spite of immobile ones. 13. Approach will be taken to incorporate by stages the district level projects so far included in the central level projects while formulating annual plans and programmes. Target of the Seventh Plan While formulating the Seventh Plan special attention will be paid to the programmes of the Water Supply and Sanitation Decade and the facility of potable water will be extended to 69 percent of the population at the end of the Seventh Plan and from limited resources and means. According to the programme, 67 percent of rural areas and 94 percent of urban areas will enjoy the facility of drinking water. To attain the above objectives, 9,362 thousands of additional population will be provided with the drinking water facilities. Of this, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage under the Water Resources Ministry will provide this facility to 4,508 thousand, the Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation to 300 thousand and the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development to 4,464 thousand population. In addition to this, designs of rural projects commissioned in the Sixth Plan were made to serve for another 10 to 15 years both in respect of water supply and for increase in population. Thus during the Seventh Plan period additional 9362 thousand people will get the benefit of drinking water facilities, By the end of the Seventh Plan 13.1 million population will be benefited by the piped drinking water, supply facilities inclusive of 3738 thousand people having this facility by the end of the Sixth Plan. This comes to 69 percent of the population. Of the beneficiaries in the Seventh Plan, 9024 thousand people will be in rural areas and 338 thousand people in urban areas. Outlines of the Programmes for Implementing the Seventh Plan These 89 projects which were initiated in the Sixth Plan will be completed by the Seventh Plan. From these projects 261 thousand population will benefit. Furthermore 17 foreign aid projects in the Eastern Development Region will be completed and 63 thousand people will be provided with the drinking water facilities. 2. Tubewell Projects Special emphasis will be placed on digging of the shallow tubewells, as the groundwater is easily available and dependable in the rural areas of the Terai region. During the plan period installation of shallow tubewells will further provide drinking water facility to 2600 thousand population. Consumers committees and local panchayats will be mobilised to implement these projects with the construction material and technical services made available. Moreover, deep tubewells will be installed and drinking water supplied in semi-urban and densely populated areas. In the Seventh Plan 133 thousand population will be benefited by drinking water supply after completing 9 on-going projects of the Sixth Plan and additional 5 deep tubewells. 3. New Rural Pipe Drinking Water Projects During the plan period, the piped water from 13 new drinking water projects will be supplied to 1,325 thousand population. While implementing new projects of pipe water supply in rural areas, priority will be accorded to the feasible projects out of the projects studied for feasibility. In addition, projects for which feasibility studies have not been conducted, such studies will be conducted and feasible projects will be gradually implemented. In the implementation of such projects, rural areas with scanty supply of drinking water will be ordered priority. Efforts taken by the got is not sufficient to provide the drinking water supply to the maximum number of people from the limited resolution. Therefore in the implementation of such projects, local labor, skill, resources and technology will be mobililsed to the maximum. Consumers, committees and local panchayats will be involved in this endeavor. From the government level necessary construction materials and technical services will be made available for the implementation of such projects. 4. Reforms, Renovation and Extension The traditional natural sources like taps, ponds, wells were meeting some of drinking water requirements in many parts of the Kingdom. It is necessary to conserve and improve these traditional sources and maintain their services. Thus during this plan period 50,000 populations will be benefited by the supply of drinking water from the conservation and improvement of the on-going taps, ponds, wells and constructing others at suitable places. Necessary measures will be taken to control contamination of water from then sources. Besides, completed projects will be modified, reconstructed and extended to supply drinking water to additional 90 thousand populations. Only if these completed projects can be properly maintained, these projects can better contribute over a long time. The responsibility of maintaining these projects should be handed over to local units. Only then the government\\'s limited resources and means can be utilised for the implementation of new projects and maximum number of people served. Therefore, the responsibility of operation of small and medium-scale projects will be handed over to the local level units. Besides, these provisions will be made for the renovation, extension and modification of the completed projects. 5. Feasibility Study If probable projects for the coming years could be identified along with their economic and technical feasibility studies, feasible projects can be incorporated at the time of plan formulation and then implemented. As such detailed feasibility studies will be conducted for 500 projects in the Seventh Plan. In addition to the pure drinking water, sanitation has equal importance in public health. In real sense it is the duty of all people to keep home surroundings neat and clean, But due to lack of publicity of public health and people awareness, most of the people have not paid due attention to hygiene. Hence, importance of hygiene on health will be widely publicized to awaken peoples consciousness in co-ordination with the Ministry of Health during the Seventh Plan. In order to arouse mass awareness towards sanitation programmes, 25 thousand low-coat toilets will be constructed as models. Necessary technical assistance and construction materials will be made available by the government for the construction of low-coat toilets. Of this, 10 thousand toilets will be constructed in the different schools to habituate people to use toilets. The remaining 15 thousand toilets will be constructed in the necessary places of the semi-urban and densely populated rural arms. This project will benefit 200 thousand populations. Sewerage will be installed in densely populated urban areas and low-cost sanitation programmes launched in other urban areas. Up to the end of the plan, sewerage facility will be extended to 164 thousand population in the densely populated urban was of the . Similarly sewerage will be gradually introduced in the main urban areas of the kingdom like Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Butaul, Birgunj, Janakpur, Biratnagar and so forth. 7. Drinking Water Supply Programme in Urban Area In order to improve the drinking water supply situation in the urban areas, the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage and the Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation are actively involved. For the fulfillment of the drinking water needs in urban areas, Greater Kathmandu, Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birguni drinking water projects am under implementation with IDA loans and expected to be completed in the Sixth Plan. Under the very International Development Association Loan, third phases of Greater Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Dharan, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Birguni, Hetauda, Pokhara, Butwul, Bhairahawa,,and Nepalganj are targeted to be completed in the fiscal year 1986/87. After completion of this project the condition of the drinking water supply in these urban areas will greatly improve. By the end of the Sixth Plan 109 litres of water will be available in the urban areas per capita per day in average. The problem now facing the drinking water supply in Greater Kathmandu we the lack of surface water sources. To solve this problem effort is being made to tap the ground water resources. After completion of third phase project in 1986/87 an additional 83 thousand cubic meter of drinking water will be available and will fulfill the water requirements of the population up to the fiscal year 1991/92. Regarding the supply of drinking water requirement after the year 1991/92, provision will be made in this plan to study and implement alternative ways and means. Furthermore a long-term plan of drinking water supply will be prepared for the Kathmandu Valley in this plan period. In the context of the fast increasing urbanization along with the development works, feasibility studies for the renovation and extension of drinking water facilities are being conducted, for other urban areas like Mahendranagar, Dhangadhi, Birendranagar, Tribhuvannagar, Bharatpur, Rajbiraj, Lahan, Dhankuta, Dhadrapur, Illam and others in addition to the urban areas with on-going projects. In this plan period, these feasibility studies will be completed and arrangements made for their implementation. Of this, 300 thousand populations will benefit from the Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation and 38 thousand populations from the Department of Water Supply Water Sewerage. The quality and quantity of drinking water will be improved, in addition to the provision of the drinking water will be improved, in addition to the provision of the drinking water facility to the additional population and the plan aims to supply 200 liters of drinking water per capita per day. 8. District Level Project under Decentralization During the Seventh Plan, the district level projects will be implemented according to decentralization plan. In the district level drinking water project, fall projects and impact of which is limited to a district and not within the domain of development committees. Within this category comes the pipe water projects, shallow tubewells, sanitation programme, supervision and maintenance, while formulating and implementing district level products priority will be given to those urban, semi-urban and rural areas devoid of water supply facilities. And approach will be to implement these project at the local level mobilizing local labour, skills and resources and with the support of construction materials and technical services. This will increase the interest of the local panchayat and consumers in project implementation resulting in the completion of the projects a t low cost and within a short duration. Only if appropriate arrangements are made for the operation and maintenance of completed projects, services from them can be derived for a long time. Hence, the responsibility of operation and maintenance of the completed projects will be handed over to local panchayats and local consumers themselves. The technical support locally unavailable will be made available from the central level. Thus, the role of local participation will be vital in the foirmulation, impleme ntation, operation, and supervision works of the district level projects. PANCHAYAT Decentralization and Local Development Policy and Programme Background After the advent of the Panchayat System, local panchayat bodies have been playing the role of political backbone and have been contributing towards raising the standard of living of the common men, fulfilling their basic minimum needs, mobilizing local leadership, activity, skill and resources and automating the process of development at the local level. The panchayat sector that was being accorded the place of third sector in periodic development plans of the country since the third plan period was entrusted an even more important role in the Sixth Plan. Under the various kinds of projects including large integrated rural development projects have been implemented in the field of local development. A brief account of the progress during the Sixth Plan is given below: Progress of the Sixth Plan During the Sixth Plan period, progresses were implemented relating to drinking water, irrigation, environment, cleanliness, education transportation, and women\\'s development. Similarly, programs were implemented also relating to integrated rural development, local development training, research and population education. Besides these, programs were conducted, also under special development grants, relating to various local development priority development projects by mobilizing local resources. During the Sixth Plan period, 789 projects are expected to be completed, including 550 projects under rural development drinking water program, 65 projects under Rasuwa-Nuwakot integrated rural development project, 20 projects under Kosi Hill area rural development project, 25 projects under Rapti integrated rural development project, 27 projects under Karnali-Bheri integrated rural development project, 80 projects under Mahakali integrated rural development project, 148 projects under intensive hill-development project, 2 projects under Dhulikhel development project, 17 projects under resource conservation and utilization project. Drinking water projects have also been undertaken under tubewell program, Dhading integrated rural development projects, remote area development project, and Bhaktapur development project. Besides these, various projects have been undertaken also under development grants program, special program and  special program. Daily 3 crore 31 lakh liter, (33.1 million) water is expected to be supplied and additional 7 lakh 36 thousand (0.736 million) people am expected to be benefitted in rural areas by these projects. Under the irrigation development program, 187 projects have been undertaken, including 35 projects under canal irrigation, 21 projects under Rasuwa Nuwakot integrated rural development project, 40 projects under Sagarmatha integrated rural development project, 19 projects under Rapti integrated rural development project, 13 projects under Karnali-Bheri integrated rural development project, 25 projects under Mahakali integrated rural development project, and, 34 projects under remote area development program. Further, it is estimated that Kosi hill area rural development project will provide irrigation facilities to 2134 hectare and intensive hill area rural development project will provide irrigation facilities to 825 hectare. Thus, inclusive of these two projects, under the local development program, irrigation facilities will be available to an area of 6699 hectare during the plan period. Various projects relating to local development have been undertaken during the Sixth Plan period in order to develop transportation system in the rural sector. During the first four year period, 1472 km. of roads have been constructed, including 674 km. under remote area development program, 524 km. under integrated rural development program and 274 km. under food for work program. Further, in order to facilitate rural transportation system, 150 suspension bridges and 16 wooden bridges is estimated to be constructed during the Sixth Plan period. The Sixth Plan had the target to conduct training and seminars for 7231 persons, including panchayat secretaries; technical assistants, drinking water mechanics, roofing mechanics, administrative officers and other gainful employment oriented training. Similarly, there was targets impact training relating to consumer committee, agriculture, rural women, technical vocations, community volunteers, etc. through five women training centres. During the plan period, 6287 persons were imparting training. For the development of backward tribes, they were targets to complete 135 projects relating to economic, educational and social development in some village panchayats of Dhading, Makawanpur and Chitwan districts. For the development of women, various programs have been completed for skill development under various integrated projects. Besides these programs, 85 training and seminars and credit programs were also conducted under women development program. During the Sixth Plan period, under women\\'s judicial services project, achievements include the establishment of 3 offices, free legal services to 1703 women legal literacy imparted to 1650 women, expansion of library, etc. Various programs were under taken relating to afforestation, road construction, school cooperation, temples and monasteries, buildings, drainage and urinals, drinking water, etc. also under Dhulikhel development project,  valley special program and Bhaktapur development project during the Sixth Plan period. Under development grants program, there were targets to undertake 39409 projects on the basis of the mobilization of people\\'s participation during the Sixth Plan period. Against this target, 14,377 projects were undertaken during the period, Among these projects, those completed during the first four year period included 3052 drinking water, irrigation, trails, tracks, suspension bridges and other projects. No information is available as to where and what number of projects were undertaken under special program. Progress Review and Problems The description given above shows that achievement of many projects undertaken during the Sixth Plan period were equal to or exceeded the targets, and there were also many projects whose achievements are not satisfactory. The programs have lagged behind from the point of view, of financial resources, number and benefits to be obtained. These projects have problems relating to preparation, follow-up, physical and financial resource mobilization, manpower skills, coordination, mobilization of local resources, training, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to make necessary arrangements for solving these problems in the process of preparing the Seventh Five Year Plan. In this context, the implementation of the Decentralization Act has started in the Kingdom. Various provisions have been made under this Act and the rules framed under this Act. Provisions have, been made for consumer committees to play an active role, for the role of various bodies in the mobilization of financial and physical resources, accounts and auditing, etc. It is necessary to intensify and make effective the mobilization of local resources which is an important dimension of people\\'s participation. It is not possible to provide effective support in policy, physical and technical matters without, periodical follow-up of the implementation of various projects. It is necessary to have a consistent and institutionalized system of project preparation, progress reporting and evaluation. In the context of integrated rural development projects, it has become necessary to make inter-ministerial coordination effective. It has not been possible to benefit the targeted people. Investment of resources has not been possible to the desired extent. It has become necessary to prepare projects in a mutually complementary and supplementary manner. The role of the donors has been increasing and, as a result, the objectives, organization and nature of investment of various projects have been undesirably diverse. In the context of preparing local development program for the Seventh Plan, the achievements and the problems described above have been taken into account and the objectives and policies have determined accordingly. Objectives, Policies and Program of the Seventh Plan The Seventh Plan has adopted following objectives and policies in order to ensure the institutional development of panchayats and decentralized process of plan preparation and implementation, to mobilize local leadership and local resources, to fulfil local felt needs, to raise the standard of living of the people on the basis of plan preparation according to priorities and to stimulate self-sustained development.

In order to make panchayat training program more meaningful and to enable it to contribute to local development, the programs under the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development will be encouraged to mobilize their own resources and use the same in conducting training programs. 6. In view of the shortage of skilled manpower at the local level and the increasing number of various local construction projects, arrangements will be made for improving the construction works and to enable local workers to undertake the construction works under the guidance of the limited skilled manpower. 7. With a view to maintaining, a good qualitative standard of construction materials and to ensure the availability or reliable construction materials to the local people, arrangements will be made as far as possible to allow the purchase of only those materials that ate recognized by the HMG Institute of Standard. 8. In order to effectively implement various central and district level projects under local development program and to provide timely support to the program, arrangements will be made for effective follow-up and evaluation and the reporting system will be strengthened. 9. In order to make rural development services easily accessible to village panchayats, service centres will be established ordinarily in 9 places, in the district according to the policy of decentralization and services will be made available in various sectors. 10. The integrated rural development projects implemented in various districts and to be implemented in the future will be within the framework of district development plan and under its process accordingly. 11. Appropriate development programs, will be implemented to raise the economic standard of poor communities because of geographical, social and economic causes. 12. In order to strengthen the monitoring and progress reporting system for projects at the district level under the Ministry of Panchayat and Local, Development, the role of regional directorates, under the Ministry will be changed and arrangements will be made to collect progress report through them. For this purpose, reporting schedule for use from village level to central level and necessary forms will be prepared and arrangements will be made accordingly. 13. To encourage the timely completion of projects to be implemented with development grant and other sources and to prevent the misutilization of resources, policy will be adopted to proceed according to the principle of financial discipline regarding resources to be furnished to local projects. Necessary steps will be taken to stop the projects that could not be completed in time without valid reasons and to have compensation of the amount already spent. In order to bring the system and the decentralization acts and rules in practice, necessary amendments and improvements will be made on the local project agreement format. Efforts will be made to meet the felt needs of the local people on the basis of local leadership and people\\'s participation. Accordingly, the overall district level development work to be implemented in the village, town and district level has been called district development plan. Following projects have been included under district development plan: 1. Projects to be implemented with the resources of the village, town and the district. 2. Projects to be implemented on the basis of grants obtained from His Majesty\\'s Government Majesty\\'s Government. 3.

Financial Progress Expenditure target for residential building and civil construction project during the Sixth Plan period was Rs 180 million. The main problems relating to residential building and civil construction project in the Sixth Plan are the lack of responses to tenders, delay in contracts, lack of amins and other problems of administrative nature. The works under various town development committees have proved to be haphazard. Some small works done by town development committees are of the nature that could have been done by local town panchayats. In development instead of being engaged in small construction works, town development committees should be active in master plan preparation and major development works of the town. Building to be constructed with grants in Lumbini development project have not been constructed because of the lack of bricks. Further, archaeological excavation works have also lagged behind targets because of the lack of technical manpower and adequate resources. Lack of coordination has proved to be the handicap in the implementation of Kuleswor and Dallu projects to be undertaken under  town development project. Objective, Policy and Program of the Seventh Plan Many things remain to be done for residential buildings and civil construction in view of the current status of the project. During the last two decades, urban population has increased tremendously. The population growth in urban areas has been caused not exclusively by the natural rate of growth. Migration from the hills and Terai rural areas because of the social and economic opportunities and other facilities in town has also caused the growth of urban population. Along with this, increase in the density of population in various towns of the Kingdom, unplanned settlement and unplanned expansion of urban areas, housing inadequacy, unhealthy environment, wrong pattern of land use, etc, have also emerged as problems. It is necessary to tackle these problems of inadequate housing, pollution and unhealthy environment and to preserve and protect the places of historical, cultural and religious importance in the country. In view of these facts, following objectives, policies and programs have been adopted in the Seventh Plan. Objective The main objective of the Seventh Plan in this respect is to expand and develop urban areas in a planned way on the basis of land use pattern that is also conducive to the development of rural areas in the country, to increase residential, cleanliness and other facilities and to keep urban environment healthy. The expansion and development of towns and sub -towns will be according to the land use plan based on the urban development process prepared on the basis of physical survey of various areas. 2. Local panchayats will be activated to prevent unplanned residential construction in urban areas and to ensure planned residential construction according to land use policies and rules under the town master plan. 3. Various public services being provided by various Government bodies in urban area, including drinking water, drainage, electricity, roads, telecommunications will be coordinated and special attention will be given to have these services provided according to Master Town Plan. 4. Necessary improvements will be made on the existing organizational system to make town development plans and programs more effective. 5. Necessary arrangements will be made to enable private sector to play a leading role in an institutionalized manner to meet the increasing demand for residential houses and to solve residentia l housing problems in urban areas. 6. In order to develop the towns of  as a metropolis, the existing master plan will be reviewed and will be made the basic point and programs will be undertaken accordingly. 7. Studies will be made and substantial projects will be prepared to extend to other towns as well as the sewerage disposal service which is at present limited to  town panchayat area only. 8. Research will be made to encourage the increased use of local construction materials in residential constructions and special measures will be taken for their increased use at the public level. 9. Arrangements will be made to impart training to local town panchayat staff on town plan preparation and implementation and urban development manuals will be prepared, central level bodies, including the residential buildings and civil construction department, town development committee, civil construction teams, etc. will be ordinarily limited to the preparation of civil construction project for town. Besides this, the role of town panchayats will be emphasized increasingly according to decentralization act in conducting development works related to town panchayat. 10. Concrete measures will be taken to complete the reconstruction of Singha Durbar Secretariat as per time bound schedule of operations. 11. Master plan will be prepared for important places like Lumbini and Tilaurakot connected with the life of Lord Buddha and arrangements will be made for implementation accordingly. Lumbini development fund will be established to make arrangements for finance and determine policies for the development of such places. Under the Fund Managing Committee, one unit will be formed for administration and implementation and another unit for preservation. The rights, duties and responsibilities of the committee and the units will be specified. 12. Plan will be prepared to furnish manpower and specialists for excavation, preservation and maintenance and will be implemented accordingly. Amhaeological findings from important places around Lumbini and Tilaurakot will be preserved in the museum there. Emphasis will also be placed on the complementary type of investment that will help the general people around the area to make social and economic progress from the Lumbini investment. The order of priority of the program to be implemented according to the above objectives and policies will be as follows: 1. Uncompleted projects implemented during Sixth Plan period. 2. National priority projects and Lumbini development project. 3. Town development works of towns that am regional centres. 4. Housing plan and programs. Program Projects proposed to be implemented to fulfil the objective of the Seventh Plan an included under the following programs: a. Development and expansion of town that are regional development centres. b. Town development plan preparation, studies and training. c. \\tSingha Durbar Secretariat reconstruction. d. \\tConstruction materials research, use and publicity. e. \\tLumbini development project. f. \\tMiscellaneous. a. Development and expansion of regional development centre towns. The Kingdom has been divided into five development regions with a view to making proportionate social and economic development in various geographical regions of the country. In the process of meaningfully removing the imbalance between population and resources distribution, the imbalance between developed and backward areas and the gap between people\\'s living standards and development investment, regional planning plays an important role and attention has been given to this from the past plan period. In this context, in order to implement regional development works and make these more effective, we centre has been established in each development region. These development centers have remained important from development and administrative points of view. The policy has been adopted to develop these regional development centres as towns. In view of this policy, projects have been prepared and implemented for the economic, social and physical development of development centres for planned land use, to provide physical facilities, make marketing arrangements for cottage industry goods, parks and residential housing, for repair and renovation of historical archaeological and religious places, to create healthy urban environment and similar works. The Seventh Plan also has the objective to develop regional development as medium towns and also to support rural development in each region. The development of these towns will prove helpful to reduce the migration of the people around the area to large towns for employment and other purposes. Therefore, five projects have been included for implementation in this plan period under this program, including (1) Dhankuta town development project (2) Kathmandu Valley town development project, (3) Pokhara town development project (4) Birendranagar town development project, and (5) Dipayal town development project. 1.

Town development plan preparation, studies and training program Because of processes of industrialization and urbanization in urban areas, specially large towns, of the kingdom of Nepal, population has increased rapidly and urban are has expanded in an unorganized manner. The objective of this program is to develop and expand these areas in an organized manner. In view of these objectives, following works will be undertaken in the Seventh Plan. 1. Preparation of land-use plan It is very important to prepare land-use plan for organized development and expansion of towns. Therefore, during the plan period, base map and land-use plan will be prepared for nine towns including Bhadrapur, Rajbiraj, Damak, Illam, Banepa, Jaleswar, Bharatpur, Kalaiya and Taulihawa. 2. Construction manual preparation and study In order to organize government and private sector construction works in town panchayat areas, it has been the policy to prepare and make available construction manuals. This will be helpful for control and supervision of construction works in local town panchayats. The Seventh Plan has the targets to prepare construction manuals for Birgunj, Janakpur, Butwal, Nepalgunj and Bhairahawa towns. 3. Town planning and implementation training In the decentralization act and rules, provisions have been made for resource mobilization by local panchayats for town development at the local level. Therefore, town panchayat staff will be imparted training on subjects relating to town, development and management and land-use implementation. 4. Urban and development studio and residential projects preparation Statistics and information will be collected on the development and actual status of various town panchayats of the kingdom and reports will be prepared after studying various aspects of urbanization fit view of the increasing problem of housing in urban area, housing plan will be prepared for some town panchayats.

Besides this, works will be completed also for expanding laboratory for using various kinds of construction materials. E. Lumbini development project Lumbini development project is very important from national and international points of view. This project was started in Rupandehi of Lumbini 0zone in the year 1956. However, steps were taken to activate the project only the year 1969. During the past decade, the progress in physical infrastructure and other works by His Majesty\\'s Government for Lumbini development is satisfactory as compared to targets. During the Seventh Plan period, construction works will be completed for the periphery and internal roads and staff quarters and other buildings, Arrangements for water and power distribution will be completed. Works to be implemented with donation will be conducted. Master plan will be prepared for excavation works on Lumbini Tilaurakot and Ramgram that are important and connected with the life of Lord Buddha and excavation and preservation works will be undertaken accordingly. Archaeological findings from excavations in important places around Lumbini and Tilaurakot will be preserved in the museum there. Lumbini development fund will be established, implementation units will be organized, and their rights, duties and responsibilities will be specified. F. Miscellaneous Following two projects have been included under the miscellaneous program. This project in the Seventh Plan makes provisions for Bhaktapur office building construction and extension, to complete remaining construction works for dumping site; to construct 15 service yards and container sites, slaughter houses and vegetable cleaning places, Besides this, public urinals will be improved and constructed. Cleaning works will be conducted in 3 towns. Survey will be made of refuge status in some towns and feasibility studies will be completed for a small recycling plant and rural compost plant. 2. Government buildingservices Under this project, services will be provided for supervision of design, cost estimate and construction works on national level government buildings. The existing record of government buildings will be revised and updated. Further residential houses will be built in Manang (Chame) for government staff, based on local technology and materials, and amenable to collective use. Financial Target An amount of Rs 158.1 million has been proposed to be spent for the above projects in the Seventh Plan; Allocation of this amount for various projects is given below; CHAPTER 45 ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM Administration is one of the significant aspects for the country\\'s development, as are other different aspects. For the effective implementation of development programmes efficient and firm administrative machinery is a must and efforts are on towards the reform of administration since the start of the planning. Achievements of the Sixth Plan Target of the Sixth Plan were to conduct organization and methods study, group classification and position description, civil employees\\' records, administrative training under the administrative reform; and internal training and setting-up of a press under the Public Service Commission. As against the target of conducting administrative survey of 20 offices, 5 special studies, offering consultancy services to 5 corporations and implementing 20 recommendatory reports, administrative survey of 12 offices, 4 special studies, were conducted, consultancy services to 4 corporations offend and 15 recommendatory reports implemented within the first four years of the Plan. Group classification and position description of postal services, agricultural services, fores t services and engineering services were completed. Under, administrative training, the Ministry of General Administration is conducting two types of training-gazetted and nongazetted. As against the target of training 800 gazetted third class officers, administrative assistant training of 1500 non-gazetted employees and typing training of 1750 under the Sixth Plan, 675 gazetted employees and 4148 non-gazetted employees have been imparted training up to the year 1983/84. which has been imparting training since 1982/83 has trained 81 gazetted third class officers recommended by Nepal Public Service Commission as against the target of 72 in the first year of its inception and trained 77 in the year 1983/84 as per target in basic pre-service training. In Addition to this, the  is conduction various workshops in-service training, training of corporation managers, seminars, studies and researches. Under the Nepal Public Service Commission internal training programme 232 employees have been imparted training and a mini-press has been set up. In order to boost up the mobilization of domestic resources instilling skill to the employees involved in revenue administration and accounts, Revenue Administration Training Center has been imparting training to the gazettedd and non-gazetted employees since 1981/82 only 330 employees have been trained against the target of 856. But in the years 1982/83 and 1883/84 progress was more than the target with the training of 1024 and 1511 employees as against the target of 965 and 1435 in the corresponding years. Outline of the Seventh Plan Programmes Hence to gear up the Administrative machinery towards overall development of the country making it more people and development-oriented, administrative reform plays more significant role. On the other it is also the clarion call of the day to develop the administrative capability of His Majesty\\'s Government in tune with the increasing development activities and growing responsibilities. Objectives 1. To make development administration more capable and firm, and supportive in the successful implementation of development programms. 2. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative units and make the general administration more people and development Oriented and productive. Policies 1. Taking into account the intent of Decentralization Act, duties and responsibilities of the employees ascertained and delegation of authority delineated. 2. The policy of tieing up the achievements in the development projects with evaluation of administrative machinery and career development of the employees will be stressed. 3. In order to do away with the various constraints in the implementation phase, present work procedures and regulation will be reviewed and amended so that these problems do not recur. As then is an imperative need to enhance the capability of development administration for the successful and effective implementation of development programmes, topmost priority will be accorded to create an active and efficient development administration. In the Seventh Plan period, attention will be focused on strengthening some ministries charged with the implementation of economic and productive development programmes. It is desirable to assess and review how appropriate are the intent and purposes of the services then instituted to the present day government administration in context of the changed circumstances, In addition, solution has to be sought regarding the practical problems in the management of services and groups as a result of absence of job descriptions of various positions in the civil Service. In technical services, groups have been classified and job descriptions prepared for some services, but their implementation has not been so satisfactory. In administrative services, though them am accounts group and groups of Foreign Service personnel, classification of groups and job descriptions of positions are in initial stages. A study will be undertaken to see how and to what extent position-oriented services can be instituted to create an effective personnel system for the present day governmental operations. 2. Complete review of the Civil Service and acts and rules pertaining to it will be conducted. Similarly, various non -technical and technical services, groups and sub -groups will be studied and reviewed. With the recommendation of this task form the Civil Services will be made mom timely and reformed. The task force will be instituted under the Ministry of General Administration and with representatives of the Nepal Public Service Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the Secretariat of the National Planning Commission. From the stand point of timely reforms, it is desirable to review the acts and the rules pertaining to the administration of the civil service personnel every five years. Hence, complete review will be made in these acts and rules in the second year of the Plan i.e. in 1986. After reviewing the classification in the last plan period of technical services into groups and subgroups, a follow-up will be done to know in how many organizations position description of officers were, implemented, how effective they were, or why could they not be implemented of they were not brought into effect. While preparing the position descriptions of the administrative services these facts will be taken into account. Position descriptions with clearly spelt cut duties and responsibilities have been prepared for technical positions. During this plan period position descriptions with duties and responsibilities will be prepared for the administrative services and also for gazetted positions. While preparing position descriptions, required educational qualification and skill for each position will also be determined. 3. If management can not attend to personal and individual problem of the employees in view of their special role within the organization and treat the employee as mere employee it will tell on the work performances of the incumbent. There is still no organization within His Majesty\\'s Government to assess, and help solve the grievances of the employees. It has become essential, however, to check in time the possible environment of dissatisfaction among the employees, through sheer ignorance of ever growing complexity of personnel administration. In this context, possible role of a guiding and counseling system to motivate and redirect the employees to their work, will be studied and appropriate steps taken. 4. For clear and effective personnel administration, personnel records should be secured and made up-to-date. In view of the growing number of employees and complexity of personnel administration it has been essential to keep the records more scientific and in an effective way. With this in view computerization of civil service records will be studied and appropriate steps taken. 5. In order to make the selection procedure mom scientific in the selection of employees required for the development administration, timely reform will be brought about in the examination procedure of the Nepal Public Service Commission. 6. A high level Manpower Coordination Committee with representation from the Natio nal Planning Commission Secretariat, the Tribhuvan University, the Ministry of General Administration, the Ministry of Education and Culture, Concerned Ministry and the Nepal Public Service, Commission will be set up for the coordination in the demand and supply of short term and long term manpower required for the development administration of the country. C. Enhance the Administrative Capacity of Ministries With the objective of enhancing the administrative capability of ministries with economic and productive programmes and for their effective involvement in development, a unit will be set up to deal with administrative reform works in such ministries, with cooperation of the Ministry of General Administration, following points will specially be taken into account in the work of the unit. 1. Implementation schedule will be prepared for the implementation of approved study reports prepared with a sole purpose of administrative reform of concerned ministry. 2. The officer entrusted with the work of the unit will represent the Ministry of General Administration. He will help in the organization and methods study, collect the information on changes in or deputation of manpower and analyze it, up-date the internal administration manual, up-date the organization manual of the concerned ministry and in close liasion with the Ministry of General Administration help in the correct use of the formats designed for information exchange. 3. If the organization, activities and procedures of the concerned ministry are deemed necessary to be changed or reformed, he will submit an analytical report with recommendations. 4. He will ensure coordination between the concerned ministry and ancillary projects and vice versa. 5. With a view to improve the administrative performance he will help in the supervision of the organization and methods, work performance, records management, office management, personnel motivation, and help set up regular, systematic and effective operations. D. Administrative Training Training is an essential element to upgrade the skill of employees. If complete and up-to-date job-related knowledge could be imparted to the employees their skill will evidently increase. Hence it is essential that employees\\' training is conducted in a continuous basis and their skill, increased. Uniformity is a felt need in training programmes conducted by different organizations of His Majesty\\'s Government. For this, it has been deemed appropriate to run all trainings under the one roof and the Nepal Administrative Staff College will, hence, be strengthened. This organization will be so strengthened as to coordinate internal trainings conducted by different organizations and directly affecting different programmes of His Majesty\\'s Government and to coordinate with international training organizations for training needs of His Majesty\\'s Government. In the plan period, different training programmes will be conducted through the  to bring uniformity in the administrative trainings. In so doing the  will run these programmes in co-ordination with the Ministry of General Administration, the Nepal Public Service Commission and other organizations. Miscellaneous Following programmes will be conducted under the Nepal Public Service Commission: 1. Printing Press Facility: In view of the growing amount of printing materials and their confidentiality, the existing press will be equipped with other facilities. In the plan period, monotype composes and casting facilities will be provided to the press. 2. Reform of Examination Procedure: Necessary arrangements will be made to wall plan examinations of the Nepal Public Service Commission. 1. General Background The role of systematic plan formulation, effective implementation and evaluation am significant for the success of a plan. For the formulation of development programmes and projects in accordance with the aims and objectives of a plan up-to-date and reliable statistics collection processing, analysis and publicity am essential. Subsequent to the formulation of development programmes and projects, another important, process is their implementation. Even though programmes and projects are good, if they are not correctly implemented, planning won\\'t have any mewing. Since the Seventh Plan period, central and district level programmes and projects have been formulated on the basis of the Decentralization Act, Rules and the procedures there to. In this exercise of programme and project selection, assessment of formulation, besides the National Planning Commission, central level ministries and departments, local level panchayats have a major role to play. In the programme and project formulation at the district level, local panchayat and district level offices have to be more active as per the Decentralization Act. 2. Achievements of the Sixth Plan On progress evaluation of programmes and projects under planning and statistics in the Sixth Plan, in planning, basic needs study has been completed and report submitted under manpower development study, demand and supply of manpower under His Majesty\\'s Government, government corporations and under transport and industry in private sector have been studied and report prepared. Under library and review room, library is being strengthened and cataloging being conducted. Besides these programmes not included in the Sixth Plan but needing urgent study like mid-term review, long-term agriculture plan, long-term food plan, long-term land use plan and impact study of primary education, review and follow-up studie s have been implemented. In statistics, of the projects included in the Sixth Plan, National Census 1981, National Agricultural Census 1981, Industrial Census 1982, and Cottage and Small Scale Industries Survey, and Index of Agricultural and Industrial production are being implemented. For national amounts and deflator system development requisite statistics were developed and up-dated though the progress in this work was far from satisfactory. Similarly resultant of cottage and small scale industries survey could not be used due to various anomalies. 3. Objective of Planning and Statistics in the Seventh Plan Hence the main objective under this heading will be to make the collection promising analysis and storage of statistics more scientific and applicable to coordinate the activities of different organization, involved in this work and make them more capable; systematize the information and data exchange, and thereby support plan formulation and policy making. 4. Policies 2. Priority will be accorded as necessary for the, preparation of long-term plan and projection of a few important sectors. 3. Central Bureau of Statistics will be activated and made effective as a central organization to collect and maintain the quality of statistics, and to play a lead role in the field of statistics offering technical advice and help as necessary to different organizations. 4. Policy will be to make correct and reliable statistics available after the collection, processing, and correcting anomalies and duplication in course of analysis. Priority will be accorded to the collection of statistics of national importance and in other significant areas. 5. In this plan period emphasis will be given to the capacity-expansion and development of National Computer centre and necessary facilities will be provided for the computerization in government and non government sector for wider use of computer. A. Planning: 1. Employment studies of following topics to be conducted on priority basis (1) \\tStudy and evaluation will be conducted on the kind and extent of employment opportunities created for different kinds of labours as a resul to investment in different sectors in the Sixth Plan. This study will address how best policies and programme in future can be geared to the creation of employment opportunities. (2) \\tFor the achievement of top-priority employment objective of the plan, studies and research will be conducted to thresh out means of creating wide employment opportunities in non-agricultural sector. 2. Impact study of the Sixth Plan on the life style of the people As it is desirable to take in stock of the benefits and impact that the development programmes if the Sixth Plan have on the life style of the people, such impact study will be conducted taking into account the study experience of the plans in the past. 3. Study for the meaningful implementation of national level policies. For the meaningful implementation of national level policies, necessary studies will be conducted through concerned ministry and organization. 4. Long term plan and projection Long-term plans and projections will be prepared for important sectors from the stand point of national economy like agriculture, forestry, irrigation, hydor-electricity, education, health, drinking water and transport with long term perspective policies and objectives for the coming 15/20 years after up-dated review of long term plans so prepared. 5. Study on the resource mobilization from agriculture sector Maximum mobilization of internal resources is essential for the economic development in a developing country like ours. Since agriculture sector occupies the prominent place among different sources of revenue, it is utmost essential to pay heed to the possibility of raising revenue from this sector. Keeping in view of the studies to date, main aim of the plan will be to study the present sources of revenue in agriculture sector, actual revenue collected thereof basis of raising this revenue, constraints there in the probable means to solve them. 6. Library development For planning and research purposes, stress will be laid on the development of a fitting library and storage system in the National planning Commission Secretariate. 7. Achievement evaluation Achievement evaluation will be carried out for some selected completed projcets. 8. \\tReview and monitoring Necessary arrangements will be made to make review and monitoring more meaningful. 9. Mid-term progress review of the Seventh Plan Evaluation and review of the progress achieved and the rate of progress against the targets up to the middle of the Seventh Plan will be conducted. 10. Training and study provision To make planning effective Internal and external study, training, and seminar provision will be made to upgrade the skills of manpower in the National Planning Commission, ministries, departments and other units engaged in the plan and programme formulation, policy making, analysis, evaluation etc. 11. Formulation and publication of the eight Plan Arrangements will be made for the formulation and publication of the Eighth Plan. For this plan period computer programme have been affixed as follows. 1. Expansion of computer facility and capacity Computer services will be extended further for the maximal utilization of existing facility and capacity and additional facility added and capacity expanded as needed . 2. Computer education and training To develop computer manpower, necessary training, seminars and workshops will be conducted. 3.

Establishment, development and expansion of computer network.. With a view to establish and operate a computer network throughout the kingdom, efforts will be made to gradually connect out computer with the network of other countries in this region. 6. Establishment of national information system. Statistics and informations of national importance will be stored, up-dated and re-trieved at times of need in a national information system to be created 7. Publicity and information For wider publicity of different aspects of computer, publications, talk and radio programme and exhibits will be arranged. 8. Development of computer technology in Devanagari Support will be provided to the efforts made to date in computer processing in Devanagari. Budget: For the implementation of above programmes a total of Rs 111.6 million is allocated. C. Statistics For this plan period, programmes relating to statistics are as follows; 1. Industrial census 1987 Studies and collection of statistics of number, condition, structure and contribution of existing industrial organisation of the country will be carried out and report thereof will be published. 2. Cottage and small scale industries survey Defining the cottage and small scale industries so as not to recur the errors as found in s imilar past survey, detailed descriptions will be collected of such industries from all districts of the kingdom. Result of the tabulation will be published and report will be prepared after analysis. 3. Development of social statistics After the analytical study of social statistics and indices social statistics will be published in an integrated from. 4. Co-ordination and strengthening of statistics and development of statistical methods and measurement In order to aviod duplications, correct anomalies and to upgrade the quality of statistics, rapprochement will be brought about among the organisations involved in statistics including the Central Bureau of Statistics and statistical works will be conducted as per the Statistics Acts and Rules. 5. Statistical publication and library development In addition to the regular publications of statistical reoorts, requisite statistics will be made available to internal and external organisations, and a library of statistics will be developed. 6. Indices of agricultural and industrial production Indices at constant prices will be compiled for the correct evasluation of progress in the field of agricultural and industrial production; their consumption stock and external trade; 7. Development of national accounts National income statistic is the main index among the economic indices. In view of the information requirements ofthe policy makres, planners, researches and the general public, this statistics will be developed in current and constant prices and country\\'s production, consumption, stock and external trade statistics will be prepared. 8. National agricultural census From this, statistics as to the number, areas, size and kinds of holding, land use and ownership will be derived at and their result published. 9. Population surveys To monitor information on changes in the population statistics on significant aspects of population like fertility, mortality, and migration will be derived at and their result published. 10. Analysis of population statistics After analysis of data of the population census, statistical changes observed in available population statistics and population projections will be prepared and published. 11 \\tPreparatory work for the national population census, 1991 As decadal national census of population is a major national event preparatory works will be carried out prior to the census . Budget For the implementation of aforementioned programmes a total of Rs 15.3 million is allocated. Of the allocated amount of Rs 111.6 million for the computer programmes contribution of His Majesty\\'s Government will be Rs 3.3 million and balance amount of Rs 108.3 million will be borne out of its own resources. In sum, the allocation for Planning and statistics is Rs 26.6 million. Chapter 47 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY In the process of country\\'s development capital, labour and materials have significant roles to play, so is the role of science and technology in the modernization of the country. Nepal being a small country, scientific and technical proficiency inherent in our country is almost know, knowledge of our latent capacity is important to know also from the standpoint of information as to the areas of technologies we have to import from other countries. No matter traditional or modern, we must have the knowledge of machineries of the technology and their component and their operations. If we also possess the capacity to repair them in case of breakdowns, we won\\'t have to face the difficulties due to these machineries for development. In a predominantly agricultural county like , technological development should directly benefit the peasants class. In researches on other sectors, too, there should be frequent interactions between the researchers or innovators and actual users. This way results from the researchers or innovators and actual user. This way results from the researches would be such that could be utilized for the development words. The country today faces difficulties in various areas, and research regarding their science and technology aspects is to be conducted. However, in view of the economic capability of the country the research and only to be limited to critical areas. If the research were not oriented to certain addition, programmes in these plan should be so formulated that they support determined national level policies of the Seventh Plan. Achievement of the sixth Plan Though area of science3 and technology was accorded a separate place only from the Sixth plan, one or other kind of work in this area had been taking place for the last six decades. Within last 25 to 30 years some educational and training organisations in the field of science and technology, organisations dedicated to the survey and analysis of country\\'s means and resources, infrastructures, research laboratories and policy making bodies have been set up in the ;process of country\\'s socio-economic development. With these programmes long dependence on foreign countries for the training of medium and high level technicians has been curtailed and high level manpower in some scientific and technological fields is being produced within the country. Collection of analytical statistics about some means and resources of the country had been accomplished. Similarly works have been started to arouse people\\'s consciousness in science and technology. Thought some efforts had been made to some extent in the country by various organisations in the field of science and technology, may more efforts are, of course, still to be done in this direction. In the review of the efforts and achievements in the country made in this short duration, some thought provoking issues and a few problems have cropped up. In the talk and discussion programmes mainly following issues have been raised: development and application of science and technology has yet to help raise production and productivity and an appropriate relations still to be developed between the researchers and the users; reliable analytical data regarding country\\'s means and resources is still to be made available; and in no-industrialization of the country, the continuing supply situation of necessary technologies in almost all sectors of development through imprecation, and without choice, evaluation and their modifications. Keeping in view of this situation in science and technology, Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST) established in November 1982 with a mandate of integrated development and extension of science and technology has been conducting programmes of national laboratory development, research and development promotion of science and technology, infrastructure for science and technology etc. since its inception. Similarly, National Council for Science and Technology instituted in 1975 began to integrate and implement programmes of science and technology and thereby coordinate them with the process of country\\'s development. Subsequently in the Sixth Plan it had been conducting, under the programme of appropriate technology development and extension, policy research & studies in various areas like agriculture, forestry, industry, power, construction materials that contribute to the basic needs fulfillment of the general public. Under survey and research of natural resources, survey of different natural resources (like cereal crops, building construction, solar energy) that are likely to fulfil the basic needs of the people. Under the choice of technology and evaluation system development programmes, evaluation of traditional industrial technologies, study of specialty of local equipment applicable in various productive areas, and choice and evaluation of foreign technologies that are in need of country\\'s development are being carried out in addition to this, books on various aspects of science and technology have been published. Objectives of the Seventh Plan Compatible with the overall development objective of the country, objective will be to aid in raising the standard of living of the people through the maximum and better use of the country\\'s means, resources and skills through the medium of science and technology and by meeting the basic needs requirements of the people . Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology and National Council of Sicence and Technology will implement national level policies of science and technology. Programmes of these two organizations are as follows. A. Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology 1. In connection with the development of infrastructures in science and technology, necessary arrangement will be made to set up different national level laboratories. Aims of these laboratories arte to aid in the activities of governmental and non-governmental organizations, practical works of higher level science students and also in its own research programme of the Academy. In addition to this, these will also contribute to the supply of basic needs requirement, savings in the foreign exchange, development of modern technology, transfer of appropriate technology (modification of imported technology to local conditions) and capacity enhancement of science and technology. Stress will also be laid on strengthening the existing ones while setting up such laboratories. 2. Under research and development, scientific and technological studies and research on different areas like chemical fertilizers, bio-fertilizers will be conducted and integration in these works set up. Such schemes have great significance in the context of the declining productivity of the land when Nepal is a predominantly agricultural country. Research will be so conducted that will enable to mainly fulfil the short them and long0term national requirements. \\' 3. Under promotion and motivation programme, various activities like publicity will be undertaken to familiarize science and technology in the general public. 4. Necessary steps will be taken for dissemination of national and international information and knowledge on science and technology. From this researchers will find it easy to obtain necessary materials. B. National Council for Science and Technology 1. Under the policy research on science and technology, study and research will be done to determine the long term perspective of science and technology programmes to develop scientific and technological capability of the nation. 2. Under scientific and technological publications programme, research and policy study reports, newsletters, annual reports, booklets on science and technology will be published. 3. Under mapping development, one national system will be adopted throughout the kingdom for the preparation of maps. CHAPTER 48 POPULATION In order to strike out a balance between gross domestic production and population, to raise the per capita income in proportion to the growth in GDP and thereby, to upgrade the standard of living of the nesses it is utmost necessary to regulate the population growth in a planned manner. Efforts to thrash out a balance between increasing population and economic development in the country were initiated since the Third period with the implementation of family planning programme.

As it is essential to augment the capital fund of the Credit Guarantee corporation so as to guarantee the investment done by commercial banks in cottage and small scale industries, His Majesty\\' s Government along with the Nepal Rastra Bank will make available an amount of Rs 50.2 million . Credit guarantee project, that is recently operating in the Nepal Rastra Bank, Will also be handed over on the Corporation, Programmes will be launched to impart training on project appraisal and monitoring to 1,200 officer staffs of commercial banks and training on industrial management and skills to 31,500 entrepreneurs. During the Seventh plan period, total amount of Rs 1500 million will be distributed in the form of agricultural credit which included Rs 600 million from commercial banks and Rs 900 million from the Agricultural Development Bank. But as Rs 2530 million loan will be collected, the net amount of loan that will be disbursed will be Rs 900 million. In order to assist agricultural Development Bank in this task, His Majesty\\'s Government will provide Rs 500 million whereas Nepal Rastra Bank will make available assistance of Rs 1130 million in the form of refinance. As the implementation of small farmer\\'s developments projects is satisfactory, total number of those projects will be increased to 230 by the 230 by the final year of the plan by implementing additional 70 such projects during the Seventh Plan. In the year 1984/84, the number of groups under those projects was 3,504 and the number of members was 33,811. In the year 1989/90, the number of groups will be 5980 and the number of members will be 57,408. Target has been fixed to distribute credit of Rs 660 million under the small Farmers Development Project. But net amount of loan disbursement will be Rs 300 million because Rs 360 million credit will be collected. The number of members of these societies was 1399 thousand in the final year of the Sixth Plan. The number will be increased to 1415 thousand. During the plan period net distribution of credit will be Rs 130 million as those societies will disburse total loan of Rs 430 million against the loan collection of Rs 300 million. National Sajha Organization with an authority to operate financial transaction will be constituted so as to develop sajha societies in more effective way by giving a definite direction to sajha programmes. Credit Guarantee Corporation Credit Guarantee Corporation will be more actively operated for providing guarantee to the loans that banks distribute for the priority sector, during the Seventh plan period. Total paid -up capital will annually be in Creased so as to total Rs 106.0 million by the seventh Plan. In order to enable the corporation to better perform the task. out of the total amount of Rs 50.2 million which is to be added for the propose his Majesty\\'s government will bear Rs 25.1 million and remaining amount will be provided by Nepal Rastra Bank. During the Seventh Plan period, the Securities Exchange Market will be further organised to simplify the process of capital transactions. The centre will be more activated to provide advice as well as assistance to entrepreneurs who intend to accumulate capital resources through the mobilization of savings. The number of investors who invest their savings in the government development bonds and the other securities will be augmented from 4 thousand to 16 thousand by operating market promoting activities in all the five development regions. Under the Securities Exchange Act-1983, management of professional brokers will be done and training programmes will be conducted to develop this profession. Past Development Efforts, Achievements and Constraints Introduction: The Eighth Plan is the first plan of the democratic government formed through popular elections following the restoration of democracy brought about by the historic people\\'s ovement of 1990. In this context, the perspectives of this plan are based on two principal contradictory factors. These factors consist of, on the one hand, the positive aspects of the new aspirations and enthusiasm among the general public and, on the other, the negative aspects of the legacy of economic depravity left behind by the panchayat regime. The present challenge of the plan is to strike and effective balance between the ever growing needs and rising expectations of the rapidly increasing population and the limited available financial and natural resources. This challenge has been further compounded by the degradation of natural resources and environment. These circumstances naturally call for political discipline, thrift and economic sacrifices. Under these trying conditions, too, the great expectations and enthusiasm obtaining among the people can serve as a primary source of energy for the process of economic modernization. During the period prior the the restoration of democracy, a three year plan and five year Plans were formulated and implemented. Thus, despite the intention of developing the nation rapidly through the utilization of planning as a development tool, the economy could not achieve the desired progress. One of the primary factiors for this was the inability to clearly establish inte4rrelationship among the goals and among the objectives, priorities, strategies and programmes of the plans. This led to the establishement of a tradition of adopting a new goal prior to the accomplishment of a previous one. Hence, there appeared to be a lack of continuity and long-term analysis in the process of selection and identification of goals. The selection of strategies and priorities, too, reflected similar drawbacks and in spite of the considerable investment made during the period, no desired progress was achieved. The distortions in policy matters, strategies and programmers as well as the weakness in implementation evolved as the characteristic features of the then periodic development planning process. An evaluation of the major economic and physical indicators during this period presents a gloomy picture, Although during the panchayat regime progress was made to a certain extent in areas like transportation, communication, health, drinking water, literacy and the ratio of student enrolments, but the economic achievements were vague and disappointing on the whole. No economic changes were brought about in the life style of the majority of the population. An analysis of the economic changes brought about by the planned development efforts in the past in presented below. Economic situation: 1. Gross Domestic Product: Owing to the low growth rate in Gross Domestic Product in Comparison with the high growth rate in population, the per-capita income recorded only a marginal increase during the period 1964/65 to 1989/90. During this period, the average annual growth in GDP was 3.4 precent whereas the growth in per capita income was a mere 0.8 percent. In absolute terms, the per capita income reached Rs 1,605 in 1989.90 as against Rs 1,304 in 1964/65. Thus, in a period of 26 years, the increase in per capita income was merely rs. 301 at 1974/75 prices. As a result of the low growth rate in per capita income, Nepal happened to stand low even among the poorest nations of the world. At constant prices the GDP had increased by 3.4 percent during the prices the GD P had increased by 3.4 precent during the period 1964/65 to 1989.90 by recording the growth rate of 3 percant in agricultural sector and 3.8 percent in non-agricultural sectors. In the past, especially during the seventh plan period (1985-1990), it was estimated that there had occurred an unprecedented growth in agricultural production. In reality, records of cultivated areas previously left out were adjusted after cadastral surveys which led to an increase in the crop farming area giving rise to inflated estimates of agricultural production. Thus, the growth in GDP during this period appeared to be unrealistically high. Efforts are currently underway to rectify this situation. If the aforementioned unrealistic growth were excluded, the growth rate in per-capita income during the seventh plant would be considerably lower. As a result of the low economic growth rate and the widening economic and income disparities, a process to push many more people below the poverty line was intensified. Various studies have been conducted for the purpose of quantifying the people living below the poverty line in Nepal. These studies have estimated that 40-60 percent of the populations are living below the absolute poverty line. According to the National Planning Commission estimates based on the assessment of available data, the percentage of the people living below the poverty line is put at about 49 percent. Thus, a large segment of population is deprived of the basic necessities of life. The  share of the agricultural sector in GDP was 65.1 percent in 1964/65, which recorded a slight downward trend by reaching 61 percent in 1989/90. while the share of the non-agricultural sector in GDP ought to have grown commensurate with industrialization in the course of development, it is estimated to have recorded merely 39 precent in 1989/90, by recording a low growth rate as against 34.9 in 1964.65. Thus, it is evident that there were no substantial improvements in the macro economic structure of the country. In addition, the mode of producti8ion continued to be traditional. Due to the lack of growth in employment opportunities in non-agricultural sectors, the labour force subsisting on agriculture could not be transferred to other sectors. The reliance of the growing labour force on agricultural pursuit where labour productivity was already low led to a further decline in per capita production in agriculture. The problem has been further compounded by the fact that the agricultural labour force has to rely excessively on the monsoon. Foodgrain production which stood at 3.152 million metric tones in 1961/62 reached only 5.698 million metric tones in 1989/90 with an average growth rate of 2.1 percent per annum only. This increase, again, was due mainly to the expansion in the agricultural land reather than an increase in productivity or the use of agricultural inputs. The efforts of this period were insufficient even to maintain past levels of average per capita agricultural production. The per capita food grain availability was diversely affected owing to the low growth rate in food grain supply in comparison to the growth rate in population. In the irrigation sector, too, only 550,467 hectares of land had access to irrigation facility by 1989/90which comprised only 21 percent of the total land under cultivation. Notwithstanding the encouragement provided for the development of the industrial sector in the past, this sector remained in its rudimentary stage. The share of the manufacturing sector including cottage industries stood at about 5 percent of GDP and provided employment to only about 2 percent of the total labour force. The sector lacked dynamism and was unable to establish the kind of growth which induces forward and backward linkages with other sectors of the economy. Although the growth rate of this sector in general has been marginally higher the that of the economy as a whole, some industrial units prospered as a result of protectionist policies. This is, however, incompatible with the general trends towards economic liberalization. Capacity utilization in industries, profit yielding and investment with value added activities were slake. No sub-sector under the industrial sector was able to attract either domestic or foreign investors. 2. Investment and savings: Again, to increase the quantum of investment, there had to be a concomitant reduction in consumption expenditure and increase in gross domestic savings. Instead, the total consumption expenditure during the past 16 years rose from 90 percent of GDP in 1974-75 to 93.9 percent in 1989.90. this was mainly due to the increase in government expenditure from 7.6 percent of GDP in 1974/75 to 11.5 percent. As a result of the increase in the consumption expenditure, the occurred a decline in gross domestic savings by 3.9 percent, thus bringing down thepercent to 6.1 in 1989/90. this evidently led to increasingly heavy reliance on foreign savings in order to bear the burden of the increased investment. While the gross investment comprised foreign assistance to the extent of 4.5 percent of the GDP in 1074/75, this reliance was estimated to have gradually risen and reached 12 percent in 1989/90. 3. Government Financial Situation: The development expenditure increased with an average growth rate of 19.7 percent per annum from Rs 608.6 million in 1972/73 to Rs 12,997.5 million in 1989.90. Converted to figures at constant prices using urban consumer price index (1972/73 = 100), the development expenditure from 1972/73 showed an average annual growth of only 9.1 percent, by recording a total expenditure of Rs 2677.2 million in 1989/90. as a percent of GDP, the total development expenditure stood at 5.5 percent at current prices and 4.6 percent at constant prices in 1972/73, a nd to 14.3 percent at current prices and 8.8 percent at constant prices in 1989/90. 3.2 Sources of Financing Development Expenditure: An expansionary policy, especially on internal and external expenditure and borrowings, was adopted during this period. The growth rate in the past years in internal resources as a financing source for development expenditure stood at 16.4 percent at current prices and 6.1 percent at constant prices. These growth rates were insufficient to cope with the increasing development expenditure. Consequently, this led to an increased and heavy dependence of the economy on foreign aid. During the period between 1972/73 and 1989/90 the revenue increased at the rate of 17.3 percent at current prices and 6.9 percent at constant prices. A structural analysis of the revenue reveals that it depended entirely upon traditional sources of revenue, as new revenue sources were not tapped. The contribution of taxes to GDP stood at 2.3 percent at constant prices from indirect taxes and 0.8 percent from direct taxes in 1972/73, which rose to 4.0 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in 1989/90. in the past years the regular expenditure recorded an unprecedented high growth. The regular expenditure increased by 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at constant prices during the period from 1972/73 to 1989/90 the regular expenditure compared to GDP was 6 percent at current prices in 1972/73, which reached 7.3 in 1989/90. Thus, at constant prices the regular expenditure recorded as growth from 2.8 percent in 1972/73 to 4.5 percent in 1989/90. A detailed analysis reveals that there occurred a fundamental directional change in regular expenditure from the fiscal year 1974/75. There was and accelerated growth in the expenditure in defence, internal security and debt servicing. Consequently, the share of the regular expenditure in economic and social sectors showed a decline in the total regular expenditure. This phenomenon corroborates the fact that the economy is increasingly becoming dependent on loans and the flow if financial resources channeled directly towards economic and social services for development is very much limited. In addition, the expenditure under the economic services for the maintenance if physical infrastructures, which were created with large investment, remained low. All these factors hindered a substantial growth in revenue surplus. The revenue surplus stood at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product at current prices in 1974/75 and 2 percent in 1972/73 at constant prices. This figure remained at 2.9 percents at current prices and 1.8 percent at constant prices in 1989/90. b. Deficit Finance: Thus, the mobilistation of deficit finance became an important tool of resource mobilistation due to the decline in the revenue surplus and the lack of optimum utilization of foreign aid. The rate of growth in deficit financing from 1972/73 to 1989/90 was 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at 1972/73 constant prices. The share of deficit finance in gro ss domestic product, which stood at 0.9 percent in 1972/73, increased to 1.7 percent in 1989/90 at 1972/73 constant prices. Furthermore, due to the relatively simpler loan procedures of the banks, internal loans were mostly obtained from the banking sector. This, however, led to a further rise in the price level prevailing in the economy. c. \\tForeign Assistance: Due to limited internal revenue mobilistation, there was a growing reliance on foreign assistance for development expenditure. There appeared there significant trends in forging assistance during this period. Firstly, there was a gradual increase in the share of foreign assistance in the development expenditure. While the foreign assistance contributed 37.4 percent of total development expenditure in 1972/73, the figure increased to 61.1 percent in 1989/90. If the internal loans are added to this figure, the total debt obligations as of 1989/90 reached Rs 38,957.9 million (US$ 1334.2 million) from Rs 223.4 million (US$ 22 million) in 1972/73. Thus, the debt obligations increased from 2.0 percent in 1972/73 to 42.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1989/90.1 The level of total expenditure in gross domestic product was at 5 percent in 1964/65, which reached 22 percent in 1989/90. On the other hand, during the same period, the share of revenue in gross domestic product reached to only 10 percent from 3 percent. Consequently, the gap between revenue and expenditure reached as high as 12 percent from 3 percent. Thus, the existing state of government finance clearly reflects its gradual weakening over the years. Due to insufficient mobilization of internal resources, there occurred a rapid growth in debt servicing obligations commensurate with the increase in foreign assistance. The obligations of the payment of foreign debts and interest exceeded the rate if gross government revenue earnings. At the same time, due to a system which implemented projects identified and formulated with a heavy inputs of foreign advisers and implemented in the influence of commission agents rather then influenced by the nation\\'s needs, whatever resources were utilized could not provide direct and substantial benefit to the people and thus the system led to as increase in the burden of foreign debts. As the return from the investment in the economy were not obtained in time, the foreign aid, too could not be fully utilized owing to the inability to sustain the counterpart expenditure estimated to be at 1=0.22 required for the utilization of the foreign aid during the Seventh Plan period. 4. Monetary and Credit situation: The main factors for the increase in money supply was due to the increase in foreign assets by 14 percent and in internal borrowings by 26.1 percent. During the same period, while the private sector loans increased by 21.3 percent, the government sector borrowing recorded a growth of 28.5 percent. These factors limited, to a certain extent, the activities if the private sector. During this period, a contraction in the money supply was caused by large increase in time deposits and the gradual growth of capital and other items. One an average, the item deposits increased by 24.7 percent per annum and the incre ased in net capital and other liabilities was 35.2 percent. During this period, as shown by the review, money supply (m2) recorded an average annual growth of 17.7 percent. The level of resources and their utilization in the commercial banks increased in an average by 22.1 percent per annum from Rs 92.9 milion in June/July 1962 to Rs 24,759.3 million in June/July 1990. Among the soruces of financing for Commercial Banks, the total deposits recorded an average annual growth rate of 22.2 percent and reached Rs 21885 million from Rs 79.3 million during this period, the current savings, and The bank loans and investment, which were primarily confined to private sector only until June/July reaching in aggregate Rs 18,917.1 million. Thus, the average annual growth in loans and investment during this period was 23.0 percent. The excessive growth in government expenditure particularly during the later years of review led to a rapid increase in borrowings if the government and private sectors. The loan disbursement ration of the commercial banks which stood at 60.6 percent in June/July 1962, steadily rose to 70.1 percent in June/July 1990. joint credit extension of Agricultural Development Bank, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and Employees Provident Fund increased to Rs 1580.1 million from Rs 241.1 million recording and increase of 13.4 percent per annum between the period 1974.75 to 1989/90. Despite the insignificant success in the realization of principal in comparison to credit extension, the loan realization has increased at 16.8 percent per annum during this period. While loan realization in comparison to loan disbursement was 37.2 percent in 1974/75, the overdue portion of the outstanding loan gradually increased to 58 percent in 1989/90. While the unrealized loan stood at Rs 405.1 million in 1974/75, it increased to Rs 543.1 million in 1989/90 at a rate of 18.9 percent per annum. Out of the total credit extension of Rs 1014 million by the commercial banks for the different uses of the private sector in 1974/75, consumable and social uses was 48 percent, trade 45.5 percent, industry 5.1 percent and agriculture and other use 1.4 percent Following the change in investment pattern, out of the total credit extension of Rs 11,798.7 million in 1989/90, the investment in industry, trade, consumable and social uses, agriculture and other uses was 32.3 percent, 28.6 percent, 23.8 percent, 13 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. The loan disbursement of the commercial banks increased at 17.8 percent per annum during this period. 5. Price situation: During the period of the base year 1972/73 to 1989/90 the national urban consumer price index increased at an average if 9.2 percent per annum. The price of food and beverages increased at 9.8 percent whereas the pricfe of non-food goods and services increased at 9.6 percent during this period. There was tremendous pressure on price due to internal and external reasons during this period. Rise in oil price at the international level, worldwide price increase if development and construction materials and consumable goods, increased cost in internal production and transportation, recession in internal production were the main factors responsible for price increase. Besides, there was tremendous pressure on price following an increased money supply at an average if 21 percent per annum because of the big increase in government expenditure during the seventh Plan (1989- 90) Period. In addition to this, the main causes of price increase were the increased cost of goods and services produced by corporations, rice in international price of petroleum products, industrial raw materials and other goods, change in foreign exchange rate and decline in production of the non- agriculture sectors – due to trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India etc. 6.1 Foreign Trade: An analysis of the data of the past years (1962-1990) reveals that the situation of foreign trade of the country was not in a good shape. Export at current price had increased at an average if 11.2 percent per annum during this period while the import had increased at 14.2percent during the same period. Total trade deficit during this period had increased at an average if 16.6 percent per annum due to a limited export base in comparison to import. Although considerable success was achieved in country wise diversification of trade for bringing about changes in its traditional situation, no significant achievement was made in achieving trade balance by increasing the volume of export through product-wise diversification. The increase in the internal dema nd for agricultural products commensurate with the increase in population caused a decline in the surplus for export. Furthermore, the level of export development remained weak due to the low level of industrial production and the continued dependence of agricultural production on weather conditions, too. The trade deficit with India increased from Rs 186.3 million in FY 1961/62 to Rs 3,979.7 million in FY 1989/90 in spite if the fact that the share if India in the total foreign trade of the country had started decreasing and the share of overseas countries had increased as a result of efforts towards diversification of trade in the past years. Similarly, althouth the trade with overseas countries was worth Rs 7.1 million in FY 1961/62, the trade deficit continued to increase and reached to Rs 9186.3 in FY 1989/90 while the share of India in the total foreign tradee of Nepal was 97.7 percent during FY 1961/62 this recorded a gradual decrease to 22.7 percent only in FY1989/90. During the same period, the trade with overseas countries increased to 77.3 percent from 2.3 percent. Similarly, while the shares of export and import trade with India stood at 95.5 percent and 98.9 percent respectively in 1961/62, they gradually declined over the years to 12.7 percent and 25.2 percent respectively in 1980/90. The trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India made 1989/90 an abnormal year, which also contributed to the trade with India drop to its lowest that year. Besides, the main reasons for the gradual decrease in trade with India in the previous years were the decline in surplus of traditionally exported agricultural products for export due to their increased internal demand and the country–wise diversification in import if daily consumer goods, construction materials and industrial raw materials from other countries following the expansion of trade with them. In the context of the trade structure of the country during this period, while the foods and raw materials constituted an important place in exp ort in the initial years, the industrial finished products replaced them following their substantial reduction in the later years especially during the seventh plan period. Recording a gradual increase, the shared of finished products increased to 82.9 percent of the total export in FY 1989/90. while jute and jute goods, rice, pulse and timber were main exportable in the initial years, the industrial finished products such as the woolen carpets and readymade garments became main exportable in the later years. As regards the trade structure of import, the shares of foods and raw materials, industrial goods and other materials in the total import in FY 1961/62 were 39.9 percent, 59.5 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. There was predominance of industrial goods in the total import in FY 1989/90. The components of industrial goods and foods and industrial raw materials in the total imports in that year were 71.3 percent and 28.7 percent respectively. Some efforts of export promotion and the creation of some institutional bases over the past years helped achieve some success in country-wise diversification of export trade. However, no real increase in export volume could be matherialised due to the lake of sustainable and sound bases through product diversification. During the early 10 year period of the panchayat regime, there was predominance of agricultural goods such as cereals and jute in the field of export and following the gradual decline in export of these goods, the industrial goods such as woolen carpets and readymade garments occupied the prominent place in the later years. Overseas import increased considerably due to the country -wise and product-wise diversification of import during this review period. While the share of import was 13.1 percent in the gross Domestic product (GDP) in FY 1964/65, it gradually increased to 20.2 percent in FY 1989/90 The export, however, showed only an insignificant increase during the same period period. The share of export in GDP stood at 7 percent in 1964/65, which declined to 5.7 percent only on 1989/990. 6.2 Balance of payments situation: The foreign trade and balance of payment situation was used to be taken in isolation till 1970. Later from 1975 onwards it was felt that the foreign trade and the balance of payments situation needed to be coordinated with other aspects relation to monetary, fiscal, foreign exchange and production of the country and due attention should be paid to the close interrelations among them while formulating the economic policy. National police relating to the foreign trade and balance of payments situation was formulated for the first time in the sixth plan (1980-85) to orient the foreign trade towards a specified direction in order to maintain the increased foreign trade of the country and the growth of the domestic market and to minimize the increasing trade deficit. Thus, it became the foreign trade toward a specified goal of the economy during the first decade of the panchayat regime. Thought the history if foreign trade of Nepal is long, the date relating to balance of payment being available only after 1974/75, the situation analysis is possible only of the years thereafter. The balance of payment situation of the country was favorable for the period between 1974/75 and 1989/90 except for the three years between 1982/83 and 1984/85. There were deficits of Rs 675 million, Rs 126 million and Rs866 million respectively in all these 3 years in spite of the increase in foreign aid. The main reasons for the balance of payment to be unfa vourable to the country during these years were the reduction of total export and the excessive increase in import resulting in great trade deficit. Current account deficit increased considerably in all three years. Balance of payment surplus increased to Rs 2,649.6 million from Rs 355.2 million with an average increase of 14.3 percent per annum during the review period. Trade deficit increased to rs. 13186.2 million from Rs 925 million recording an average increase of 19.4 percent during the same period. While balance of payment surplus had increased by 7.5 timens in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75, trade deficit had increased by 14.3 times. Similarly, current account deficit increased at 32 percent per annum or by 64.5 times in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75. As a result, the ration of current account deficit and GDP increased intensely. While, this ration was about 1 percent in 1974/75, it increased to 8.5 percent in 1989/90. the main cause for this intense increase if current account deficit amount was the considerable increase in trade deficit. There occurred an excessive flow of foreign loans to bring down balance of payment deficit to a favourable situation in the years past. Though this was a short term expedient to make up current account deficit amount, this was not a reliable and sound was out in the long run, as it was certain that the economy itseif will have to face serious consequences in the future due to the burden of the foreign debt loan. There was a great increase in the foreign debt in the years past. There was much pressure on balance of payments situation on account of increasing current account deficit each year due to a slow growth in income from services and transfers during this period. While net income from services in 1974/75 was Rs 280.8 million, this increased to Rs2,613.2 million in 1989/90 with an average increase of 16 percent per annum. Similarly, net income from transfers in 1974/75 was Rs 523.9 million. This increased to Rs 2,818.9 million in 1989/90 registering an average increase of 11.9 percent per annum. 7. Foreign Exchange Situation: The foreign exchange reserves situation was favorable on the whole during the period of July 1961 to  July 1990. While there was foreign exchange reserves of Rs 206.9 million in july 1961, this increased to Rs 11,984.6 million in July 1990 with an average increase of 15 percent per annum. Out of total foreign exchange reserves, while the percentage of gold, I.M.F. tranche, ard S.D.R. was 6.8, convertible foreign exchange 35.6 in July 1961, this percentage changed to 3.5, 78.8 and 17.7 respectively in July 1990 following a gradual change in the composition. While there was predominance of non-convertible foreign exchange in the total foreign exchange reserves during the initial years. The reserves in convertible foreign exchange reached Rs 9441.9 million (US$ 323.4 million equivalent) in FY 1989/90 from Rs 73.7 million (Us$17.9 million equivalent) in July 1961 recording an average increase of 18.2 percent per annum in the past. Similarly, the savings in non-convertible foreign exchange reached Rs 2118.1 million (US$ 72.5 million equivalent) from Rs 119.2 million (US$ 11.7 million equivalent) following an average increase of 10.4 percent per annum during this period. Taking into consideration the reserves of both convertible and non-consideration currencies together, while it could meet the import for 5.8 months in FY 1960/61, it was capable of meeting 7.6 months’ import in 1989/90. Thus, though there was a considerable increase in foreign currency reserves during this period, development of a regular and sustainable source of foreign exchange increased due to excessive flow if foreign loan and grants and as these are not reliable sources, a situation persisted where there was the possibility of drastic reduction of the reserves. Physical progress situation: 1. Agriculture, Forest and Irrigation 1.1 Agriculture: Much importance was attached to cereal crops production programme during the periodic plans in  the past with the objective of increasing agricultural production and productivity. Considering the development of institutional infrastructures during the past period and also the priority accorded in the allocation of development expenditure to meet theabove objective, the achievements made in the agricultural sector in respect of pro duction and productivity appeared to be far from satisfactory. During the period of 1961/62 and 1989/90, while the are3a covered by the cereal crops increased at the rate of 2.2 percent per annum, production of principal cereal crops increased at an average of 2.1 percent per annum. The productivity, thus decreased by a rate of 0.1 percent. It  became clearly evident that the contribution of the increased area was pivotal to whatever increase took place in production growth. Similarly, the area, the production rate and the productivity rate of cash crops increased by 1.8 percent, 5.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively over the period. Massive expansion of organizational structures in the forest sector was carried out in order to conserve the forest area and arrange the supply of forest products during the past period. While forest development works in the hill and terai were being undertaken through a total of 22 forest divisions and 7 circle offices in 1965, forest offices in all the 75 districts, regional offices in all the regions and more than 200 ranger offices were set up by the year 1990. similarly, the number of technical manpower was considerably increased during this period. Tree plantation in 2,454 ha. of land, construction of 840 km. of forest roads and 448 km. of fire lines were carried out in F.Y 1964/65. The available date reveals that the tree plantation was done in 99137 ha. of land or 40 times more in comparison to what was achieved in F.Y. Hence, though it was claimed that massive expansion of institutional bases of the forest sector and tree plantation works was undertaken during this period, the present dilapidated situation of the forest vindicates the fact that due attention was not paid towards forest conservation, promotion and utilization. Though legal frameworks were constituted for conservation, promotion and utiliisation of forest during this period, forest protection could not be undertaken in an effective manner due to weak and inefficient implementation. The forest sector became the major source of personal income for the cunning and shrewd people. Forest determination took place intensively during this period. According to available statistics, while the forest coverage was 6,402,000 ha. in 1964, this was reduced to 6,306,000 ha. by the end of F.Y. 1985/85. 1.3 Irrigation: Before the advent of the panchayat system, the irrigation facility was only available to 11,428  ha. of land. It was estimated that irrigation facility was available to about 21 percent of the cultivated land by 1989/90 with the availability of additional irrigation facility to a total of 539,039 ha. of land during the panchayat regime as a result of heavy investment in the irrigation sector during this period. Though emphasis was given on the development and expansion of the irrigation sector in the past periodic plans, its implementation part could not be effective. The expected benefits were not forthcoming from several projects on their completion and there was lake of attention in due time towards proper repair and maintenance of completed projects. 2. Industry, Tourism and Electricity The contribution of the industrial. Sector (including cottage industry) to the gross domestic product was about 5 percent and employment available to about 2 percent of the total employment available to about 2 percent of the total labour force. During the period of three decades, the development of industry remained at the rudimentary stage and could not gain momentum. Industrial production showed and average increase of 7 percent per annum from the analysis of the production index of 18 principal industrial products from the period 1974/75 to 1989/90. while the production of Jute goods decreased at an average of 6 percent per annum during the period, the production of agricultural tools and bricks and tiles decreased at 4.1 and 1.8 percent respectively. Similarly, there took place only a slow growth in products directly associated with the needs of the society such as cement, sugar, cotton merchandise, matches, there occurred a considerable growth in consumable products like liquor, beer, synthetic cloth, soap, shoe and biscuit. The capacity utilization of some selected industries was about 63 percent during the period from 1975/76 to 1989/90. The capacity utilization of jute goods and beer industries was above 70 percent. Similarly, the capacity utilization of sugar and cigarette industries was 69 and 66 percent respectively. But the same of the cement, brick and tile and match industries remained less than 60 percent. While the contribution of the cottage industry to the gross domestic produce was 1.4 pecent in  1974/75, this declined to 0.7 percent in 1989/90. the development of the cottage industry could not be oriented towards a correct direction in the past while Rs 9.6 million was invested in 1974/75 following the registration of 70 cottage and small industries, a sum of Rs 828.6 million was invested in 1989/90 with the registration of 932 cottage and small industries. Hence, the pace of development of the industrial sector was slow in the past. The industrial policies of the past had emphasized the creation of industrial environment to increase the contribution of the industrial sector to the economy by infusing momentum into this sector. But the flow of investment could not be channeled to industries with long term benefits due to the lack of proper implementation mechanism, procedural constraints and administrative delay. Due to the distortions arising out of industrial protectionism there could not be created a favourable environment for increasing the investment in nationally imoortant industries related to production, employment and income distribution. There were no incentives to attract investment towards industries directly associated with the need of the society. Due to this, forward and backward linkages of the economy with other sectors could not be developed. On the whole, the government policy could neither act as a catalyst nor contribute in leading the country towards industrialization. 2. 2 Tourism While 7,750 tourists came to Nepal in F.Y. 1961/62, this number reached 246, 361 in 1989/90 with its average annual growth rate of 13.1 percent. While in the beginning the Kathmandu valley alone was the centre of attraction, a substantial increase in the number of tourists took place during this period due to the extension of trekking, mountaineering, national parks and other places of touristic attraftion outside the valley. Despite the increase in the number of tourists during this period, no increase in average stay and expenses incurred per day materialized for the lack of proper development and expansion of infrastructures and places of tourist attraction. While the average stay of a tourist was 13.1 days in 1974/75, this went down to 12 days in 1989/90. Similarly, while each tourist during his stay in Nepal spent $ 24.00 in 1961/62, the level of expenditure remained unchanged in 1989/90. Substantial foreign exchange was earned from the tourist sector during the period from 1961/62 to 1989/90. while the earning from the tourist sector was merely US$ 78,000.00 in 1961/62, US$ 68,343,000,00 was earned in 1989/90 with an average increase of 26 percent per annum. 2.3 Electricity Upto 1960, the total generation capacity of electric power in the country was 7.03 Mw. Out of this, 2.077 Mw. Was generated from the hydropower stations and 4.953 Mw. In the period between 1961/62 and 1989/90, some other small projects and big hydro-electric projects such as the panauti, Trishuli, sunkosi, Devighat, Gandak, Kulekhani and Marsyangdi were commissioned. By the end of 1989/90, the total generation capacity including hydro and diesel in the country was 227.084 Mw. While about 1 percent of the total population had access to electricity in 1960/61, 8.8 percent of the population could enjoy this facility by the end of 1989/90. thus, though electricity generation and distribution was increased, the burden arising from the excessive per unit cost of electricity due to completed projects being very expensive fell upon the consumers. 3. Transport and Communication 3.1 Transport a. Roads Prior to 1950, the facility of motorable road in the country was almost non-existent. A review of the situation shows that the road available all over the kingdom in 1960/61 was 1198 km., out of which 339km. was metalled and 859 km. fair weather road. Upto the end of FY 1989/90, 7,330 km. of road facility was available in the country out of which 2,958km. was black topped, 1,658km. graveled and 2,714 km. fair weather road. While looking at the road-population ratio, every kilometer of road had served a population averaging 7,780 people in 1960, upon the reduction of this ration on 1989/90, every kilometer served a population of 2441. the important highways built in the period of past thirty years are the east-west highway, Arniko highway, Siddhartha highway, Prithibi highway,  Gorkha-Narayangadh highway, Dadeldhura-dipayal-Doti highway, Dharan-Khankuta highway, Dhangadi-dadeldhura highwasy. Thus, in spite of the efforts mad for the development of road transport, several of the district headquarters od not have access to road. The construction of roads co uld not be completed as required nor could the economy derive maximum benefits from the constructed roads because of the excessive increase in the cost of road construction and the lack of timely repair and maintenance. b. Air Transport Prior to 1960AD, the country had a total of 12 airfields with 1 metalled and 11 fair weather type. Necessary physical facilities and communication services complementary to aviation were unavailable in several air-fields. In FY 1974/75 there was a total of 28 air fields, all over the kingdom with 4 metalled, 12 fair eather and 12 small airstrips. By 1989/90 the number of total air fields reached 43. the internal air service has been operated by Royal Nepal Airlines corporation. In FY 1989/90, this corporation had 24 aeroplanes and it operated its services internally is 36 places and externally in 10 cities. Long before 1960, railways and ropeways were established in Nepal. Till FY 1960/61 Nepal had 99 km. of narrow gauge railway and 23km. long ropeway linking Hetauda and Kathmandu with a capacity to carry 25 Tons of material per hour was constructed and service of trolley bus between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur covering a distance of 13 km. was brought into operation. Thus, no specific progress was achieved in the development of other types of transport during this period. 3.2 Communication a. Postal Services Till FY 1960/61, the total number of post offices all over the country was 409. it was estimated that a post office at an average had provided service to 22,252 people within an area of 132 square miles. In FY 1974/75, the country had 1,006 post offices. Out of these, there were one general post office, 74 district post offices, 254 sub-post offices and 678 additional post offices. In FY 1989/90, Nepal had a total of 2,231 post offices. Thus in 1989/90 each post office provided service to 8100 people within an area of 66 sq.km. Regarding telecommunication sector, service of 1,120 telephone lines was available through the local telephone exchanges in FY 1960.1961, which meant one line served every 8, 303 people. Population-telephone ratio in Nepal reached 250:1 with the availability of the service of 71,560 telephone lines in FY 1989/90. as regards international telecommunication, I.S.D. c. \\tRadio Broadcasting , Television Transmission and Periodicals Radio Nepal has been able to reach 90 percent of the population through medium was transmission by 1989/90 similarly, many other dailies, weeklies and monthlies has been published from the private sector for the general publicity work. In reality, the people could rarely get true and real messages through the newspaper etc. in spite of the fact that freedom to newspapers etc. plan with the motto of National communication Plan with the motto of “Communication for dev elopment” was launched in 1971. The communication sector was in fact stagnated as the media of communication were within the government control. The Nepal Television has started operation its service since 1985. 4. Social Services 4.1. Education The country made some progress in the field of education in the past. But that progress was merely limited to quantitative increase. While teacher-student ration was 1:25 at the primary class (class 1- 3) level in 1961, it increased to 1:39 by April 1990. Similarly, the school-student ration of 1:46 in  1961, recorded a significant increase to 1:156 by April 1990. Hence, a situation arose, where sufficient number of schools could not be increased in comparison to the increase in the number of students. Out of the total students of the primary class of the age group 6 to 10, 182,533 had attended their classes in 1961 and this work out to be 14.4 percent of that age group. While the number of lower secondary schools was 677 in 1972, this number reached 3964 by April 1990. similarly, the school-student ration decreased from 1:201 to 1:187 and the teacher-student ration reached 1:28 from 1:26 following the increase in the number of student from 136,010 to 344,138. Similarly, at the secondary school level, the number of schools increased from 156 in 1961 to 1959 in April 1990, the number of teachers from 1,772 to 10,421 and the number of students from 26,845 to 264,525. Hence, the school-student ration of 1961 increased from 1:172 to 1:187 by April 1990 and similarly, the teacher-student ration changed from 1:15 to 1:35. In the field of higher education, while the number of students in 1961 was 5,143, this increased to 102,130 in FY 1989/90. Development requirements of the country could not be met in spite of this quantitiative increase in the educational sector. The National Education plan (1971-75) was announced on April 16, 1971 claiming that the education system prior to the advent of the panchayat system was not in keeping with the country, time and the Nepalese society. It was believed that the system would be instrumental to fulfil the national objective of education towards preparation of neces sary manpower for economic development with the dissemination of requisite knowledge, science, development, conservation and promotion of technical expertise and skill. In the process if implementing this system, the budget was increased 5 to 6 times in the districts where the education plan had been introduced; the schools run with the public participation were brought under the government employees on the name of making the teaching profession attractive, a ten- month mandatory field work under the national Development service porgramme was introduced; sixteen institutes and campuses were established by bringing about fundamental changes in the administrative set up of teaching institutions providing higher education. The country could not make qualitative advance in the field of education as a result of the new education system; instead, there was further deteoriation. No academic changes evolved in the attitudinal perspective of the students an teachers, unsustainable financial burden increased on the educational sector and public participation was almost obliterated. Useful programmes such as the National Development service programmes were put off for political reasons. The situation of educational environment began to deteoriate further and education was taken as a medium to gain knowledge and skill. The National Education was proved to be ineffective and inappropriate on account of all these reasons. 4.2 Health To look into the development of health services, while there were 39 hospitals, 1019 hospit al beds,  55 health posts, 93 health centres and 63 ayurvedic dispensaries in the3 field of curative services in Nepal in 1961, the number of hospitals, hospital beds, health posts and health centres increased to 111, 4570, 816 and 18 respectively in 1990. while population per hospital bed was 9,146 in 1961, this was 3915 in 1990. Thus, each doctor had to provide service to 14,958 people in 1990. while the average life span of a Nepali citizen was 28 years in 1961, this increased to 53 by FY 1989/90. Family planning programme was launched as a national programme only from FY 1965/66 through the government and non -government associations and institutions while maternity child health programe was initiated around FY 1973/74 only. Afterwares, family planning and maternity child health projects were implemented in all the 75 districts if the kingdom. 4.3 Drinking water Attention was given towards providing drinking water facility right from the beginning of planned development. Drinking water programmes had been initiated especially in urban areas and some rural areas prior to 1960. By 1961 1,452,000 gallons of water per day was available to 6 percent of the population. In 1989/90, only 36 percent of the total population had drinking water facility with 67 percent and 33 percent of the urban and rural areas respectively having access to this facility. Accordingly, the available statistics shows that 5,424, 000 and 1,134,000 residents of the rural and  urban areas respectively had access to the drinking water facility. Thus, majority of the people in the country are as yet deprived from an access to hygienic supply of water in spite of the fact that expansion of drinking water facility had taken place in the past. The water that was provided was also not available in required quantities. On the one hand, there was a lack of hygienic supply of water, and on the other, there was plenty of leakage in the drinking water. In addition to this, it is estimated that 70 percent of the diseases are caused by the polluted water. Conclusions: Viewed in the total perspective, in spite of massive investments made in the past, Nepal still remains one of the  poorest nations of the world. Although some progress was made in social and physical infrastructural sectors, the progres s appeared remarkable only in comparison to the negligible figures of the base year. In the absence of any political opposition, there did exist the opportunity of channeling the autocration character of panchayat to rapid economic development but, unfortunately, this also did not mathrialise. The lack of structural change in production hindered the development process from gaining momentum. A low savings rate, the increased share of loan in forging assistance, low level of industrialization, weak agricultural production, limited export trade and a high population growth rate remained as barriers in the path of development. They economy had to face serious problems due to imbalance between resource mobilisation and expenditure, imbalance between savings and investments and between export and import and the lack of control over population growth. During the three decades of the panchayat regime, there was never a dearth of attractive fundamental reform programmes and slogans. However, these programmes were confined to mere slogans due to the lack of political commitment. Some of the functions whose initiation was attempted at conceptual and operational levels by the elected demarcation government in 1959 for fundamental changes in economic structure were given political colour and introduced as fundamental economic reform movements. Notwithstanding the fact that without people’s faith and commitment no planned development can manifest into meaningful reality and nor can any sustainable change oriented to people’s welfare be brought about in the economic structure, a revolutionary economic programme of land reform was introduced in the very beginning of the panchayat regime. Land reform was, in fact, an essential programme in a feudalistic rural society, but the inability to prepare accurate land records, lack of the guarantee of tenancy right, the existence of dual or multi ownership of land, inability to provide land for shelter and subsistence income, failure to keep prcords and make proper utilization of the collected savings, lack of diversification in crop farming and cottage industries in the rural sector and, above al, the lack of desirable growth in production and productivity during the thirty years if the panchayat regime have clearly evidenced the failure if lad reform. A national campaign entitled ‘Back to the Village’ was initiated with a view to providing a village -oriented philosophical base to the panchayat regime. It was indeed a prerequisite for rural development. However, while it was predestined that there would be no going ‘back to the village’ without the decentralization of power, the construction of infrastructure for rural development and the creation of employment opportunities, this genuine movement instead if being utilized in development programmes was developed into a system of political evaluation of panchayat workers and a means of orienting them towards position of pow3er. This movement experienced a misfortune when it turned into a process of the selection of workers, replacing the election system, masquerading as unanimity. The people were despaired of their aspirations, enthusiasm and zeal to participate in development efforts by this process, which thus created a set-back to local development. It was, indeed, not at all inappropriate on a conceptual le vel to create a basis for balanced regional development through the formation of development regions based on a realistic delineation of a north-south growth axis or development corridors. However, no efforts were made towards developing a systematic settlement of the population along the growth or development corridors in desirable proportions and there were not launched, as required, any socio-economic programmes based on available local means and resources and focusing on the generation of employment opportunities either. The construction of the East-west highway which was initiated in the panchayat regime was a multidimensional project for national development. However, the construction of this highways designed to link the remote,  \\xa0 inaccessible Far western Region could not be completed even within the stretch of thirty years. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that whatever sectors were completed, did contribute to linking the socio-economic activities of the road corridors to the market-oriented economy. Moreover, since the immediate as well as long-term effects of a project of such a great magnitude were not take into full consideration, the Terai region has now had to bear the brunt of the natural as well as ma n-made disasters like drought and floods due to excessive migration, haphazard human settlements and the degradation of the churiya region and the charkoshe Jhari (the forest belt of the Terai), once acclaimed as the treasure house of forest resources. The rehabilitation of the environment in terms of the magnitude of degradation that has occurred has become a momentous task for a century. Enlisting panchayat as a third sector in the periodic plans of the panchayat regime, statistical projections were made with regard to people’s labours contribution. People’s participation undoubtedly deserved a significant role in the decision making process but the periodic plant and the ever decreasing percentage of people’s labour contribution in the panchayat sector clearly demonstrated the fact that the so called people’s labour contribution was a mandatory obligation imposed on people for the programmes decided upon for them by others. Thus, the essential and effective prerequisites for national development, people’s participation and people’s labour contribution, could not be utilized for sustainable development orientated to people’s welfare. During the panchayat regime, programmes were implemented with greater emphasis on the task of preserving the system than on national development. A new education plan was introduced in the form of a national education system, which in reality created a havoc in the education sector. There was an excessive increase in educated unemployment with no prospects of immediate work engagement, while, at the same time the shortage of manpower required for development work persisted. Education experienced a qualitative deterioration, the government had to bear the brunt of almost an unsustainable burden of expenditure, and the public participation in education recorded s a steady decline. Many commissions were constituted and studies conducted on the issue of the decentralization of power. The  fact that efficient, autonomous local bodies are the corner-stone of a democratic system and can, uphold the responsibility of local development through people’s participation was ignored. With a view to projecting Panchayat as a democration system, some efforts were made with regard to decentralization but there occurred centralization with several instances of retrieval of the decentralized authority. Wile for the lack of decentralization in real terms, many projects aimed at integrated rural development with international assistance could not deliver meaningful results, many projects, as the studies have revealed, created a negative outlook towards development at the local level. A programme to control the increasing population was indeed indispensable. A population policy was formulated for this purpose. It included some basic activities such as the reduction of birth rate, control of immigration, control of migration from hills to the Terai and from villages to urban areas and maternal child health care. However, while the immigration problem remained unchanged due to the inability to restore cordial relations with the neighbouring country with an open border and the failure to recognize the problem in an international perspective, the other aspects of population control ended in failure for the lack of complementary programmes. In consequence, there arose impediments to urban development, the social service infrastructures became insufficient, unemployment increased, the environment deteriorated, pollution prevailed and in the long run, the adverse impact in the economy as a whole was evidently perceptible to all. Although in the three periodic plans of the panchayat regime preference was accorded to agricultural sector for intensification and diversification in crops through reforms in the farming system of this country composed of hamlets and villages, the wide gulf between planning and implementation always led to a negative result. Even those industries which had begun their operation could not flourish for not being able to acquire self reliance. The ‘basic needs’ programme announced in Dec./Jan/ 1985 became the principal slogan and priority of the Seventh plan. This programme took a vow to fulfil the basic minimum needs such as foodgrains, clothing, housing, health, education and public security among others and raise the economic condition of the people to the Asian standard by 2000. Because of the dynamic nature of the Asian standard, the term was eventually deleted from the slogan. The basic needs programme had adopted a supply oriented approach in its formulation paying no attention to the purchasing power of the proposed consumers. Without any resource mobilisation for physical and institutional development, production targets, unthinkable in a historical perspective, were set for the fulfillment of the needs. In consequence of the distorted ad hoc economic policies of thirty years interspersed with hollow slogans of disappointing development resumts and programmes without achievements, the country had to bear several economic distortions which were as follows. The control-oriented development approach of the past created many problems. Increased government control, adhoc regulations and procedures, license requirements and other forms of counterproductive bureaucratic behaviour tended to discourage decision making process and delays in the disbursement of budgets increased project implementation costs and resulted in the under utilization of the administrative capacity. Inefficient Public Enterprises: The performance of state owned enterprises reached a stage of great inefficiency, indifference and apathy. The financial liabilities of these enterprises exceeded the capacity if the government. These enterprises suffered as a result of over staffing, political intervention, inefficiency and the lack of accountability. Inefficient Investment Portfolio: Cost-benefit rations, and other criteria criteria which measure the economic and social benefits of projects were neglected in the coruse of selecting projects to be implemented in various sectors and sub-sectors. The interrelationships among projects and alternative investment options were not takes into consideration. As a result, investment could not be channeled to productive sectors. Many projects were not justifiable from economic and social points of vies. But in addition to these realities, the cost component of the economy has been further aggravated by the dominance of donor driven projects, economically unproductive investments, lack of discipline, limited economic resources of projects, unwarranted expansion of bureaucracy and lack of efficient implementation capabilities. Inefficiency in the administration has led to a further deterioration in the government’s institutional abilities to effectively implement development programmes. The civil service has expanded continuously, has been under utilized, and lacks motivation. Traditional administrative and economic structures, highly centralized authority and the lack of sufficient power at the local levels are some of the reasons. The planning process remained very weak and was poorly institutionalized. While projects were chosen on an ad hoc basis without due consideration to any social or economic criteria, government investments in projects were not based on any long term sustainability considerations. In consequence, there was always a scarcity of resources at the implementation phase. Political decisions were often autocratic and feudalistic. As a result, the planning process lacked accountability and was unable to induce genuine popular participation. While the weak programmes became centrally directed, in addition to being donor driven. Policy changes and Achievements During 1990 -1992 The main responsibility of the interim government formed after the restoration of the multi-party system through the historic people’s movement of 1990 against the panchayat regime was to concentrate on two things: 1. To formulate constitution compatible with the norms and values of Multi-party democratic system. 2. To hold general elections in accordance with the constitution. As it was incumbent upon the interim gov ernment to fulfil these two functions within a short period on a priority basis, the task of formulating a periodic plan was postponed for the time being. Subsequent to the formation of the imterim government, an understanding with India in May 1990 ended the trade impasse with India which had begun on March 23, 1989, reinstating the status quo ante in relationship with India. This understanding with India had a positive impact the year on the country’s economic activities. The government established a citizen’s investment fund, introduced wealth tax and made efforts to redue the budgetary deficit. Similarly, policies were adopted to increase the role of the private sector in agriculture and to offer additional incentives to low-income farming families in the course of providing loans. Following the formation of the Nepali congress government with a clean mandate in the general elections held in May 1991, the National Planning Commission in the course of formulation the Eighth plan brought out for circulation and approach paper of the plan. The government formed through general elections started taking some major steps to remove the distortions in the country’s economic and administrative structure. Initially, the present government took steps to transform the controlled economy of the past thirty years into an open, liberal, transparent and competive market oriented economy. The approach to the eighth plan was prepared accordingly. In order to expand the participation of private sector in economic activities, new monetary, fiscal, industrial and commercial sectors were introduced. Similarly, with the objective of achieving full convertibility if the Nepalese currency in current account, a partial convertibility system was introduced. A policy was adopted to abolish licensing for the establishment of industries except for those related to defence, public health and environment and to operate a one window system for providing facilities to the industries. In view if huge losses being incurred by public enterprises, a process was initiated to privatize three government owned industrial enterprises. Necessary procedures have also been initiated to privatize five agricultural farms in government sector. With a view to strengthening the internal air service, permission was granted to private sector to operate domestic flights. As a result, three private sector airlines have begun their domestic flight operation within one year. Liberal policies aimed at attracting more tourists have also been adopted to encourage the services of foreign airlines. With the objectives of attracting foreign investors, a new foreign investment policy was formulated. According to these new rules, project chiefs are authorized to senction estimated expenditures if upto 5 million rupees, to approve tenders of upto 20 million rupees and to modify upto 10 percent of total expenditure on technical grounds. Programmes were also initiated to privatize inefficient public enterprises for promoting their efficiency in keeping with efficient commercial principles, to reduce unproductive investment and to list 316 ongoing projects for implementation at the National Planning commission level. Direct involvement in keeping with the policy of decentralization. Accordingly, the District Development Committee Act 1992, the municipality Act 1992 and the Village Development Committee Act, 1992 have been formulated and implemented. At the same time, the election of local bodies was also completed. The local election has thus successfully laid down the foundation for a democratic system and the local bodies have now initiated the tradition of playing an important role in development activities in consonance with the policy of decentralization. Furthermore, the foreign exchange reform was another significant step undertaken during this period. Partial convertibility in foreign exchange was introducted in February 1992. Under this arrangement, the banks conducting business in foreign currency were allowed to sell 65 percent of their earnings from trade or services at the open market exchange rate by making available 35 percent of the foreign currency earning to Nepal Rastra Bank at a rate fixed by the bank. During the same period, the agreement reached with India on trade, transit and the control of unauthorized trade removed the feeling of instability prevalent in the trade sector. The new agreement incorporates significant provisions such as mutual understanding to be reached on the issue of the exemption of Indian tax on the export of primary goods from Nepal, the reduction of the mandatory constituent percentage of indigenous raw materials from 80 percent to 65 percent in the manufactured products of Nepal, the reduction of internal value added from 50 percent to 40 percent and so on. With the objective of providing direct benefits to the low income people, a policy was adopted granting one third interest subside on the current interest rates in a lloan of upto Rs 10,000 under the small farmers Development project, Intensive Banking programme, and Rural women Development programme. Similarly, another policy allowed a 80 percent interest waiver at prevalent rates of interest to the economically deprived sections in the rural area for income generating employment activities on a loan of upto Rs 2,500 procured for the spinning wheel and wool for carpet industry, handichafts, small-scale mills, small farming enterprises etc. As a part of the alternative energy development programme, rural electrification was initiated. A provision to offer a capital of Rs 7,000 was made to make the bio-gas plants accessible to rural families. These steps will make important contribution in alleviating poverty in rural areas. In order to effectively and appropriately implement the above mentioned policies, it is necessary to increase the work-efficiency of the government administrative machinery and to achieve the active participation of the private sector. The government has accordingly constituted a high level Administration Reform commission and a process has been initiated for the implementation of the commission’s recommendations’. Similarly, a commission was formed to undertake a detailed study of the civil servants’ pay scales and make necessary recommendations in order to raise the moral of the civil servants and increase their work-performance. The government also raised the salary in accordance with the recommendations of the commission. Economic Situation: A revised estimate indicates that the per capita income in 1990/91 reached Rs 1736 (at 1974/75) constant prices). Similarly, according to a preliminary estimate, the per capita GDP is expected to increase only by 1 percent in 1991/92. Therefore, the per capita income has increased marginally and estimated to have reached Rs 1754. only a marginal increase in per capita income in 1991/92 can be mainly attributed to the decline in agriculture production. In the period of 1989/90-1991/92, the gross domestic product went up by 4.3 percent with the growth of 1.6 percent in agricultural sector and 8.4 percent in non-agricultural sector. Thus, over the past few years, while the share of the agricultural sector has shown a gradual decline, the non-agricultural sector’s share has recorded a steady growth. The main contributing factors for theis can be attributed to the various efforts of the government for the development of the non-agricultural sectors. During the F.Y. 1989/90-1991/92 period, the major crops recorded an increase of 0.1 percent wit h a decline of 0.7 percent in the production indices of major food crops and a 3.6 percent increase in cash crops. In that period, while the production of most of the crops increased, paddy, oil seeds and tobacco recorded a slight decrease. The production indices of major industrial products are estimated to have gone up by 22.2 percent in 1989/90-1991/92 period. According to the new classification of industrial products, it is estimated that the production of food products, beverages, textile, tobacco products, shoes, plastic goods, the products of iron and steel based industries have increased during the period under review. Further acceleration in industrial production is expected as a result of the new industrial policy. 2. Investment and savings: In fiscal year 1990/91, gross investment is estimated to have increased at a rate of approximately 28.4 percent to Rs 21,163 million, which stands at 20.1 percent of gross domestic product. Similarly, the gross domestic savings is estimated to have reached Rs 6864 million with an increase of 23.4 percent in 1990/91. this is merly 6.5 percent of gross domestic product. It is estimated that the total consumption in fiscal year 1990/91 increased by 15.4 percent amounting to Rs 94,836 millions. Thus, investme nt-savings ration declined from 33.7 percent in 1989/90 to 32.4 percent  in that fiscal year. 3. Government Financial Situation: The total development expenditure stood at Rs 15,979.5 million at current prices in the fiscal year 1990/91. in 1991/92, the development expenditure is expected to decrease, according to the revised estimate, by 6.5 percent to reach Rs 14945.7 million. At constant prices, the total development expenditure in fiscal years 1990/91 and 1991/92 is es timated to be Rs 2997.5 and Rs 2320.8 million respectively. It is estimated that total revenue will increase by 19.7 precent at current prices and 3.9 percent at constant prices in 1989/90-1991/92 period. According to revised estimates, while the government revenue will go up by 17.2 percent at current prices and 1.7 percent at constant prices, the non-tax revenue is expected to increase by 28.4 percent at current prices and 11.5 percent at constant prices. If the revenue grows at this rate, the total revenue will reach 10.2 percent at current prices and 6.2 percent at constant prices of the gross domestic product. Similarly, it is estimated that the tax-revenue will be 7.7 percent at constant prices, and the non- tax revenue will be 2.5 and 1.6 percent of GDP respectively. The indirect taxes are thus estimated to continue their predominance in the tax revenue structure. During this period, regular expenditure will, according to the estimate, grow by 20.1 percent at current prices and 4.3 percent at constant prices. Viewed in terms of the share in gross domestic product, the regular expenditure in 1990/91 and 1991/92 stands respectively at 7.2 and 7.4 percent at current prices and 4.4 and 4.5 percent at constant prices. Patiently shouldering the newly elected government made all possible efforts to control the regular expenditure. Despite the continued efforts to increase revenue and control regular expenditure, there was no marked increade in the revenue surplus because of a low collection of taxes particularly in 1990.91 and the pressure of the increased salary of civil servants on regular expenditure especially in the latter months of 1991/92. The share of revenue surplus on gross domestic product remained at current prices at 3.0 percent in 1990/91 and 2.8 percent in 1991/92. At constant prices the figures thus stood at 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. b. Deficit Finance: During the period under review, as the targeted growth in revenue was not achieved, concerted efforts were made towards controlling the mobilisation of deficit finance in the economy and remarkable progress was made in this regard. The shard of deficit fincance is expected, especially in 1990/91, to be 1.0 percent at current prices and 0.6 percent of GDP at constant prices, and thus the share of the same in internal resource mobilisation is estimated to be only 22.1 percent. c. \\tForeign Assistance: As a result of the steps taken by the government towards eliminating the level of disparity between foreign aid commitments and their utilization, the committed foreign aid during 1990.91 is expected to have been fully utilized nearly to the extent of hundred percent. The utilized amount appears to have exceeded the aid commitments because of the inclusion of unused amount of previous years. In view of the heavy reliance on foreign assistance in the past, it was not possible to drastically reduce this dependence. Furthermore, as various projects at different stages of implementation are being funded by foreign aid and as their closure would not only entail a wastage of foreign aid in development expenditure and the share of loan in total foreign aid are estimated to be more or less equivalent to those in 1989/90. 4. Monetary and credit situation: the principal objective of the monetary policy of the period under revied was to regulate the rate of money supply at a level sustainable at the actual growth rate of national production and the national economy, to strengthen the financial base by introducing reforms in the financial sector, to make the  bank interest rates more realistic by enhancing the efficacy of indirect monetary control measures and  the economically deprived people and in the priority sectors. 16,283.6 million in mid July 1991. During that period, the currency increased by 21.2 percent ad the current deposit by 9.9 percent. This high growth rate of money supply was caused by both internal and external factors. The net forging assets increased form Rs 6203.5 million in mid July 1989 to Rs 16,150.7 million in mid July 1991. the domestic credit went up by 130.9 percent during that period. The commercial banks, it is noticed, directed their loans and investment towards the government sector during this period. Out of the total loan and investment disbursement of Rs 18,917 million form commercial banks in mid July 1990, loan totaling Rs 3582.5 Million was disbursed to the government sector. Similarly, by mid July 1991, thee government sector had received Rs, 7,373.1 million out of the total bank credit and investment disbursement of Rs 24,410.5 millions. However, the public sector undertakings appeared to have received less bank credit disbursement in mid july 1991. n the other hand, loands to the private sector gradually increased. The level of credit extension to the private sector, which stood at Rs 12,733 million in 1990. reached Rs 15026.8 million in 1991. During the period 1989/90 and 19991/92, the urban consumer price index went up by 15.2 percent experiencing a growth prate of 16.8 percent in food and beverage products and 12.1 percent in non-food product and services. The major reason behind the 15.2 percent and service. The major reason behind the 15.2 percent growth was the increase in overall index by 20.8 percent in 1991/92. the immense growth in non-food products and services accompanied by the increas e in food and beverage products in 1991/92 caused the price level reach extremely high during this period. However, both internal and external factors were responsible for this high price rise. At the internal front, the major factors were the reduction in the production of food crops because of adverse weather conditions, the devaluation of the Nepalese currency in comparison to convertible foreign currencies leading to the increase in pricen of raw materials and foreign goods imported from third countries, the immense price rise in Indian imports owing to the decline in the production of food ad other products as a consequence of adverse weather conditions and the excessive liquidity in the economy. Similarly, the external factors consisted of the increas e in the rates of foreign exchange and the inflation in Indian market etc. 6. Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments Situation: As a result of the trade impasse with India, the share of the trade with India in total foreign trade was  only 22.7 percent in 1989/90, which increased to 28.5 percent in 1991/92 following the improvement in Nepal-India relations subsequent to the people’s movement of 1990. The export, which stood at Rs 7,503/7 million in 1990/91, increased to Rs 13,939.4 million in 1991/92. Out of the total export, the export to India was Rs 1,701.2 million in 1990/91 and reached to Rs 1,568.9 million in 1991/92. On the import front, the fiscal year 1990/91 recorded the total import of Rs 24,197.9 million, which reached Rs 32,951.3 million in fiscal year 1991/92. Thus, the total trade deficit, which was Rs 16,594.2 million in 1990/91, increased to Rs 19,011.9 million in 1991/92. In 1990/91, while the trad deficit with India was Rs 6,071.2 million, with other countries ot stood at Rs 10,523 million. Similarly, the deficit with India and other countries in 1991/92 stood at Rs 10,247 million and Rs 8,764.9 million respectively. Thus, the trade deficit which increased by 26.0 percent in 1990/92 declined to 14.6 percent in 1991/92. In view of the trade composition of the country, the industrial goods have, in comparison with food products and raw materials, started gaining dominant share in the country’s export. The share of food products and raw materials in the total export was 21.9 percent in fiscal year 1990/91 and 19.4 percent in fiscal year 1991/92. similarly, which the share of industrial goods in total export stood at 78.1 percent in fiscal year 1990/91, it increased to 80.6 in fiscal year 1991/92. The increased predominance of the industrial goods in the import trade composition in fiscal year  1990/91 continued to the subsequent year of 1991/92, too. The principal reason behind the fall in current account deficit was the slackness experienced in the increase of trade deficit. During these years also, foreign grants and loans played a major role in maintaining a favourable balance of payments situation. Yet, compared to historical growth rate (1974/75-1989/90), it is on the decline. For instance, while the trade deficit increased by 19.4 percent as current account by 32.0 percent in 1974/75–1989/90, they recorded average annual growth rates of 14.5 percent and 11.5 percent respectively during the period 1989/90-1991/92. As compared to the trade deficit of Rs 16,907.6 million in 1990/91, it has reached Rs 17,302.5 million in he first eleven months of 1991/92. Although, there occurred a slight growth in service income (net) and transfer income (net), the rate growth was unable to meet the increase in trade deficit ad, consequently, the current account deficit has increased during these years. While in 1990/91 the balance of payment surplus was Rs 4,781.2 million, the surplus reached Rs 4,306.6 million in the first eleven months of 1991/92. Thus, as a result of the increased flow of external loans and capital and capital and miscellaneous capital (net), there has been an increase in the balance of payments surplus this year also in spite of the considerable increase in trade deficit and current account deficit. The policy of partial convertibility in foreign exchange was adopted since 4th march 1992. Following its introduction, the commercial banks have begun foreign exchange transactions at open market exchange rate for payments to these sectors. The foreign exchange reserve which stood at an amount equivalent to Rs 11,984.6 million in mid July, 1990, increased to Rs 19,270 million in mid July, 1991. thus, while the foreign exchange reserve in mid July, 1990, was Just sufficient to cover 7.6 months of imports, the reserve grew sufficiently to cover 9.9 months of imports by mid July 1991. Physical progress situation: 1. Agriculture, Forest and Irrigation 1989/90 to F.Y. 1991/92, the major food crops recorded a decline of 2.2 percent in production and 0.7 percent in cultivation area. During the same period the productivity of food crops declined by 1.5 percent. The rate of productivity went up by 7.9 percent. As regards the sale and distribution of production inputs in F.Y. 1990/91, 72,719 metric tons of chemical fertilizers and 2,325 metric tons of seeds were sold. At the same time, agricultural credit disbursed during that period amounted to Rs 1095.3 million. It is estimated that 86.000 m. tons of chemical fertilizers and 2210 m. tons of improved seeds were sold in F.Y. 1991.92. similarly, agricultural credit to the tune of Rs 1,220.2 million is expected to have been made available. 1.2 \\tForest: in forestry development, while tree plantation was carried out in 8,956 hechtares in F.Y. 1990/91, it was, carried out in 11,794 hectares in F.Y. 1991/92. in the soil conservation and watershed management sector, 29 gulley control, 24 landslide control, terrace-rehabilitation work in 92 hectares and protection of 43 water sources were accomplished and 283 tons pf medicinal herbs were processed. Similarly, in 1991.92 it was expected to accomplish tree plantation for soil conservation in 740 hectares, control of 34 gulleys, 83 numbers of landslide control activities, terrace rehabilitation in 239 hectares and protection of 61 water sources. During the same period, 204 m. tons of medicinal herbs also is expected to have been  processed. While the irrigation facility was available to additional 20,810 hectares only in 1990/91, it is estimated to have been extended to an additional area of 27,527 hectares. Thus the total irrigated land is estimated to have reached 598,804 hectares, which forms 22.84 percent of the total cultivable land. 2. Industry, Tourism and Electricity: The industrial production index increased by 29 percent (1986/87=100) in the fiscal year 1990/91. the main reason behind the higher growth in industrial production that year can be attributed to the convenient supply of industrial raw materials following the end of the trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India in May 1990. In that fiscal year the capacity utilization in sugar, cement, brick and tiles and jute sect ors recorded an increase. The industrial production is estimated to have risen by 15.7 percent in F.Y. 1991/92. it is estimated that is this year there has been an increase in the production of animal feed, cotton cloth, jute goods, powder soap, cement, beer, battery, plastic and jute items. During these years, the share of small and cottage industries in gross domestic product remained around 1 percent. 1990/91, it was estimated the in F.Y. 1991/92 there would be an investment of about Rs 1,801.4 millions on 4708 industries registering within the first nine months. 2.2 \\tTourism: New trekking routes were opened in mustang and Manang regions in the two 1990/91 and 1991/92 fiscal years. Permission was granted within this period to three private companied to operate air services and to one to operate companies to operate air services and to one to operate helicopter service. In respect of the extension of airport facilities, the installation of terminal tower equipment was completed in Tribhuvan International Airport and at Nepalgunj, Dhangarhi, Surkhet, Simra and Rumjatar air fields. The number of foreign tourist arrival which stood at 279,747 in F.Y. 1990/91 increased by 7.8 percent to 301, 496 in F.Y. 1991/92. while the foreign currency earning in 1990/91 was equivalent to US dollar 56.9 millions, it reached US dollar 62.1 million, going up by 9 percent in 1991/92. 2.3. Electricity: By the end of 1990/91, a total of 231.873 megawatts of hydropower was generated, which is 0.279 percent of the nation’s hydro power potential. The total hydropower generation by 1991.92, reached 238.313 megawatts, which is 0.287 percent of the total potential. 3. Transport and Communication: 3. 1 \\tTransport: a. Roads: Until the end of fiscal year 1990/91, lkm. of road served 2194 people with 3083 km. blacktopped, 2281km. graveled and 3064 kms. Fair weather road totaling 8328 km. b. Air Transport: By 1990/91 and 1991/92 there were, including Tribhuvan International Airport, 43 air fields in the country of different capacities, serving 1 Jet plane, 8 Avro air planes, 30 Twin otters and 4 Pilatus Porter. Air service was operated to 36 destinations in the domestic sector and to ten major cities in foreign countries in 1990.91 and the same situation was maintained in the fiscal year 1991/92,too. 3.2 \\tCommunication: a. Postal services: By the fiscal year 1990/91, there were all together 2231 post offices consisting of 1 General post office, 74 District Post offices, 477 Area post offices and 1676 Additional Post offices. The figure increased to 2271 post offices by the end of F.Y. 1991/92. Thus, by the end of F.Y. 1991/92, one post office served 8146 people in an area of 65 sq. kms. b. \\tTelecommunication Service: A total of 57,320 telephone lines were distributed in 38 urban areas by mid January 1991, with one line serving 3200 people. The telephone line and population ration stood at 1:290 by January 1991 with the distribution of 65,298 telephone lines in 38 urban areas. While STD and ISD facilities were available at 62 places on 50 districts until January 1991, these service were made available at 69 places in 55 districts by January 1992. Similarly, the number of countries with ISD telephone connection increased from 38 in January 1991 to 50 in January 1992. 4. Social services: In primary education, the student enrolment reached 2, 788, 644, the number of schools 17,842 and the number of teachers 71,213 by mid April, 1990, which established the school-student ration at 1:156 and the teacher-students, schools and teachers increased respectively to 2,926,000; 18,681 and 74,849 giving rise to 1:157 school-student ration and still 1:39 teacher-student ratio. In lower-secondary education, the student enrolment figure being 344,138, the number of schools 3,964 and the number of teachers 74,849, the school-student ratio remained at 1:87 and teacher-student ration at 1:28 by mid April 1990. The school-student ration and the teacher-student ration reached 1:98 and 1:29, as the numbers of enrolled students, school and teacher increased to 381,000, 4,092 and 13,207 respectively by mid April 1991. In secondary education, the figure of student enrolment, stood at 364,525, the number of schools at 1,953  ad the number of theachers at 12,399 in 1990, which resulted in 1:187 school-student ration and 1:35 teacher-student ration. By 1991, the student-enrolment reached 386,000, the number of schools 2081 and the number of teachers 11,383, giving rise to a school-student ration of 1:185 ad a teacher-student ration of 1:34. In higher technical education, the student enrolment was expected to have been 15,686 in 1990/91 and 17,919 in 1991/92. in the field of higher general education, the enrolment figure was estimated to have stood at 78,061 in 1990/91 and 91,567 in 1991/9. At the same time, a university also was established in the private sector. Similarly, in order to reduce the student enrolment pressure on existing campuses and provide job-oriented education to students, a 12-class higher secondary education (10+2) programme was initiated. 4.2 \\tHealth: By the fiscal year 1991/92, the number of hospitals reached 111, health posts 816, health centres 18 and Ayurved hospitals 155 and during the same period the number of doctors and women health volunteers (nurses) stood at 1,182 and 24,000 respectively. Thus, the doctor-partient ration and the hospital bed- population ration reached 1:15, 800 and 1:3,967 respectively. At present, the average life-expectancy of the Nepalese people is estimated to have reached 54 years. Infant mortality rate stands 102, child death rate at 165, the crude birth rate at 39.60 and crude death rate at 14 per thousand respectively. 1990/91, 5,878,000 people in the rural areas and 1,163,000 people in the urban areas, a total of 7,041,000 people had access to drinking water facilities. Out of this figure, it was in 1990/91 alone that the drinking water facility was provided to 482,899 people. 1991/92 the drinking water facility will have been provided to an additional number of 830,000 people, 30,000 in the urban areas and 8000,000 in the rural areas. Thus, according to an estimate, by the end of F.Y. 1991/92, 6,699,000 people (39 percent) in the rural sector and 1,172,000 people in the urban areas (66 percent), a total of 7,871,000 people would have has access to drinking water facilities. Challenges: As a result of the controlled and protection-oriented policies of the past, the economy could not achieve desired level of development and economic distortions emerged. This led to anomalies in the allocation of resources. In the absence of a competitive atmosphere, attention was not paid towards increasing efficiency. Therefore, no satisfactory achievement could be made in the economic sector. This gave was to increasing poverty problem. The impact of this situation was evidently felt in the last two years, as well. During the past two years, there was instability in agricultural production. As a result of the continuing heavy dependence of gross domestic production on water conditions, the trends of annual fluctuations in economic growth rate persisted. In 1991/92, the meager growth of 0.1 percent in agricultural sector are believed to provide  impetus to the growth rate of non –agricultural sector in the years to come. On the agricultural front, the development of market-oriented production pattern is necessary for the growth in integrated and coordinated manner to agricultural inputs, services, incentives and irrigation facilities. At present, owing to the execessive liquidity in the economy, while the rate of consumption in increasing, the rate of savings in on the decline. The increase in government expenditure and the lack of sufficient development in laternative inves tment sectors capable of attracting private savings have led to increase in consumption and the fall in gross domestic product. Therefore, it is incumbent upon His majesty’s Government to adopt suitable policy measures to bring about an increase in savings, to discourage unproductive investment and expenditure, to provide alternative sources for the mbilisation of savings and to promote private sector investment in productive areas. In view of the government financial situation of the last two years, the reliance on external loans has further accentuated instead of declining because of the need for adjusting the financial deficit caused by increasing government expenditure. Therefore, it is necessary to give special emphasis on the mobilisation of internal resources. For this purpose, necessary steps must be taken to check the revenue pilferage and explore new sources of government revenue, to broaden the tax bases and simplify the administrative procedures. On the monetary front, there has been an excessive increase in money supply since the last year. Due to this excess liquidity in the economy, while there has been a great pressure on price situation, the ration between gross domestic product and current account deficit has remained very high (9.7 percent). Under the present circumstances, the money-supply should be maintained within desirable limits without causing any undur scarcity of capital to intensify the pace of economic development. The increase in net foreign assets in also exerting expansionary influence on money supply. In this context, the foreign exchange should be utilized positively and productively in order to increase productivity and employment opportunities in the economy. Timely improvements on the interest rates are also required for reducing the excessive liquidity and inflation, and for promoting saving habits. Similarly, the policies of loan disbursement by commercial banks in productive, priority-accorded sectors need to be intensified so as to gradually alleviate poverty through the creation of new employment opportunities for the economic upliftment of the low income rural population. In the price situation, the problems of high price rise has not only reduced the competit ive capacity of the economy but also caused greas sufferings to the people. This has created tremendous hardships particularly in the livelihood if the people living below the poverty line. Thus, it is necessary to provide relief to the people by cutting down the rate of increase in prices. To attain this purpose, it will be essential especially to curtail the unproductive government expenditure, to increase the work efficiency of public undertakings, to monitor the price situation on a regular basis, to emphasize on the attainment of equilibrium in foreign trade and to improve the supply and distribution systems of essential commodities. In this regard, various steps were taken to achieve a regular and convenient supply of the essential commodities for the common people such as foodgrains, salt, sugar and cement. During the past two years also, the foreign trade deficit has increased and is the previous years. This has led to as increase in the current account deficit, too. There has not been much vigorous effort made in direction of expanding the export trade by exploring and identifying new viable products. Similarly, the trade deficit with India has increased on account of the increased import of manufactured items from India in comparison to the export of traditional agro -based and unprocessed products to that country. Therefore, in order to expand the export trade, due attention must be paid to the identification of new exportable products and the amelioration of quality standards of the export items. Despite the massive investment outlay for agricultural development in each periodic plan in the past, the agriculture sector could not achieve the desired progress. Therefore, in order to achieve some concrete growth in agricultural production and productivity, it is essential to make optimum utilization of the irrigation facilities through their suithable renovation, maintenance and operation, and to establish convenient and reliable systems for the distribution of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers, the dissemination of appropriate technology and th e disbursement of agricultural loans. As the drains and small irrigation projects have a great significance in agriculture and also actively involve the farmers themselves, it is highly essential to  undertake such irrigation projects on a priority basis. A new industrial policy has been formulated to intensify the pace of industrial development. The new policy have brought and end to the doubts, uncertainties and distortions prevailing is the industrial sector. Following the introduction of the new policy in 1992, approval has been granted by mid June to a remarkable number of industries seeking registration. At the same time, while three industrial undertakings have already been privatized, the process of privatization will be further continued. As the liberal and open policies professed by the new industrial policy for improvements on the economy as a whole will create a competitive industrial climate, maximum benefits must be derived from the changed climate by enhancing the industrial capabilities of the entrepreneurs involved in this sector. The government owned corporations must strengthen their management to enhance their work efficiency. Additional efforts are required to develop the necessary infrastructure for tourism, which has evolved as a main source of foreign currency earnings, and the involvement of private sector in these efforts should be encouraged. The heavy reliance on forests for the total energy consumption of the country has led to a massive destruction of forests. This has had detrimental effects on environmental balance as well as agricultural production. Therefore, there is a great need to achieve a consistent balance between the demand and the supply of timber and firewood by according priority to forestry development and by soliciting active participation of the people themselves in afforest ration activity. In spite of the immense hydropower potential of the country, it has not been possible to significantly exploit this due to the lack of resources. Viewed on the basis of cost factor, it seems appropriate to give more emphasis in the construction of small and medium scale hydro electric projects than on iarge scale projects. Greater involvement of orivate sector in required in the generaion and distribution of hydro -electricity, too. One the transport front, although some roads were constructed in the past years, there are still no link roads to some district headquarters. Further, as not much attention was paid to the proper alignment of the rode during construction, the roads have not able to intensify the economic activities of the people living in the road corridors. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the task of constructing link road to district headquarters and other feeder roads on the basis of economic feasibility studies and also to the repairs and maintenance of old roads. In the field of social services, the country has not been able to derive much benefit except for some progress in  the field of education. The lack of qualitative development in education is the main reason for this situation. Therefore, while keeping education in agreement with moral norm and values, attention must be paid to developing the quality of education and making it job-oriented. Higher education faces scarcity of physical facilities for standard pedagogy and is heavily reliant on government grants. There still persists the problem of maintaining the academic calendar, which has as adverse effect on students’ future. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a time bound educational framework and encourage the private sector involvement in higher education. Similarly, there has emerged an urgent need to upgrade the quality of primary and secondary education. The country has not been able to derive potential benefits from the investment made in the health sector as well. The physical infrastructure in health sector in being gradually developed and a big investment has also been made in the production of health manpower. However, while there is a regular complaint from people concerning the unavailability searcity of medcines and manpower in hospitals and health ectres, the burden of the increasing population on exerting a heavy pressure on social services, and this population growth has minimized the impact of development achievements. No significant education has been achieven in the growth rates of population and infant mortality. In this context, it has become essential to make maximum possible utilization of existing physical facilities, manpower and service and to extend additional facilities to rural areas. Regarding drinking water, thermajority of the country’s population is deprived of the ac cess to clean drinking water facility. The supply of water, in areas where the facility exists, too, has not been able to meet the requirement. There also persists the problem of purification of drinking water. On the other hand, it is estimated that about 40 percent of the available drinking water is being list through leakage. Therefore, attention must be paid to the control of leakage and the purification if drinking water along with the extension of drinking water facilities. The problem of unorganized housing and urbanization has acquired great magnitude. Therefore, there has  emerged and urgent need to formulate and implement timely policies and programmes with regard to housing and urbanization. Against the backdrop of the above mentioned problems and challenges, the elected government formed after the general elections of 1991 has initiated in accordance with its manifesto various efforts for the all-round development of Nepal. The present government now has to undertake the responsibility of achieving the economic disorder and distortions of the past. Matching the spirit if the challenge, the government has been striving for reforms in economic management by according priority to liberal economic policies and rural areas. Similarly, appropriate steps have been taken by the popularly elected government in the direction of creating a favourable climate for the development of the private sector. This has already led to some positive results. Several programmes have been initiated to include the rural sector in the main stream of development. However, the country’s basic structure if the economy is still very weak. The economic growth rate is low and it is essential to bring about qualitative reforms in the economic structure in order to achieve a sustainable and long lasting growth rate. The depth and extent of poverty, unemployment, the growing disparity between rural and urban sectors and unequitable distribution if development efforts on the days to come. The eights play is a significant step initiated in that direction. Different fiscal years have been taken as base years in the preparation of the foregoing chapter. (a) The final year of the first five-year plan (1956-1961) was 1960/61. However, before the end of the plan period, the erstwhile democratically elected Nepali congress government was dissolved in December, 1960. subsequently, there were continued efforts from 1961/62 to install panchayat system and as that year was taken as the base year for the second plan (1962-1965) also, the same year i.e. 1961/62 has been taken as the initial year for comparative studies. (b) \\tThe fiscal year 1961/62 remained a year without a plan. No efforts were made that year for the formulation and implementation of plan. As a result, the fiscal year 1961/62 data were not available ofr certain statistical comparative studies. Besides, because of the unavoidability of using the constant prices if 1964/65 as the base for conversion of certain data to constant prices on the basis of GDP, the fiscal year 1964/65 has been taken as the initial year at certain places and the analysis has been made accordingly. (d) \\tIn addition, it is appropriate to evaluate government financial position on the basis of current and constant process. In transforming certain date related to financial position to constant prices, the use of the urban consumer price indices rather than that of implicit deflators of GDP in more practical. (e) \\tAs the date relating to the balance of payments situation are available from the year 1974/75 only, the corresponding analysis has been presented beginning from that year. Nevertheless, in order to assist interested persons interested in of undertaking separate analysis and arriving at relevant conclusions, that data pertaining to the fiscal year 1961/62, 1964/65, 1972/73, 1974/75 and 1989/90 have been presented separately in some tables. The people have, subsequent to the restoration of democracy through the historic people’s movement of 1990, entrusted the responsibility of the country’s development to the Nepali congress by giving its mandate with a clear majority in the general elections. It is certainly not an easy task to accelerate the pace of development in a distorted economic, social and administrative milieu created by the panchayat regime during the last thirty years. While, on the on hand, the government will definitely have to make some harsh decisions, the development perspectives, on the other hand, will need to be compatible with the prevailing national situation and the economic changes in the international scenario. As Nepali congress in committed to democratic socialism, the principal objective of the economic policy will be the amelioration of the standard of living of the deprived citizens through democratic processes. Socialism, as conceived by the Nepali congress, it not orthodox socialism where the state dictates but the one by virtue of which the state in a supportive role will bring about social and economic justice through increase in production, creation of employment and special programmes directed towards the upliftment of the socially and economically deprived poor people who are left out of the mainstream of development. It is evident from the changes occurring in the socialist countries that the traditional state directed socialism is no longer suited to the existing global economic scenario. Therefore, the state directed and controlled economic systems pursued for the last thirty years will be gradually phased out and policies will be adopted to carry out development through free market-oriented liberal economic systems. In this perspective, the goals and objectives defined in the Eighth plan will be considered as indicative and as guidelines, the fulfillment of which requires the participation and support of all sections of the nation together with the capabilities of the state. The experience of several developing nations has demonstrated the fallacy of the concept that an high economic plans in Nepal, too, in the past were based on this concept and the consequences turned out to be quite contradictory. Neither the targeted growth rate was achieved, nor was poverty alleviated. This fact clearly. Indicates that for economic growth social and administrative reforms must concomitantly accompany capital investment. In view of this fact during the Eighth plan period, a conducive environment will be created for development by complementing capital investment with reforms in the age-old traditional social norms and values and inefficient administrative system fostered by the panchayat regime. As efforts aimed at raising the economic growth rate do not necessarily benefit the poor to a significant extent, special programmes will be undertaken for poverty alleviation at village level and household level. Since continuity in development can not be achieved without a sustained rate of growth, this plan will adopt a self-sustainable development process from the village level onwards. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop and mobilize human resources from the village level, to develop and extend the infrastructure for rural development and to attain minimum standard of living for the common rural populace. As this kind of development can not be achieved through traditional planning system, the pronouncement of late B.P. Koirala-“Plans or budgets should be formulated with the peasant in mind … every Nepali should have a small house to live in and a milk cow in the court yard” will serve as the guideline in making decisions concerning development programmes in the Eight plant. While allocating government expenditure, rural and backward areas will receive priority in order to build infrastructure for development such as extension of roads and irrigation, to make institutional and technical improvements in the agricultural system. To create employment opportunities for the rural population and to meet basic needs such as education, health care, drinking water and housing. For this purpose, the budgetary allocation of funds for rural development will be increased to seventy percent of the total development budget outlay. This new philosophy of planning will be reflected in the procedural structure and methodology of the plan. Development is not merely a mechanical function of capital and technology but it is also a social and political process of mobilizing and organizing people commensurate with the desired goals. It is essential to canalize the aspirations and enthusiasm of the people generated by the political change in the country to the mainstream of development, and to identify, formulate, implement and distribute the benefits thereof on the basis of people’s participat ion. Compatible with the nature of projects and development programmes, conducive environment will be created to involve peasants, laborers and entrepreneurs, engaging the concerned people themselves and the central and effective source of all actions and decisions. The proposed planning methodology will create a basis for sustained development by promoting development initiatives at the community level by enhancing mass awareness for self- development, fostering civic responsibility and self-reliance. In order to fully translate such development process into practice, the Government will adopt the policy of decentralization. Although the panchayat regime had also made provisions for decentralization, it was not implemented effectively. Authority was not decentralized to local level bodies. Since these bodies were directed by both the concerned ministries and local administration, a state of confusion prevailed in their work performance. The present democratic government will do away with such tradition and effectively implement policies ofdecentralization in all sectors. In accordance with the policies of democratic socialism, the formulation of plans will eliminate the top down approach to be replaced by the bottom up approach. As long as the development of the people, for the people and by the people is not institutionalized, possibly a conducive atmosphere may not be created for the realization of development among the common masses of the population. In order to create such environment the government has lready authorized local bodies to select, formulate and implement development projects, to allocate the distribution of benefits derived through such projects. For the purpose of avoiding delays in the implementation of development projects, the methods of the disbursement of funds will be simplified and the allocated funds made available in good time. Similarly, local bodies will be empowered to approve tenders for the supply of construction materials and the construction services for local development projects. In order to avoid the lack if onside data and information necessary for the selection of development programmes at the local level, data will be collected and maintained up-to –date at the district level on a regular basis. Concomitantly with the decentralization of authority, the local bodies will be motivated to bear responsibilities. While village level bodies will be accountable to the district level bodies, they in turn, will be accountable to the centre. It will be made mandatory that the bodies at all levels keep their accounts transparent. As the success of the centralization programme depends to a large extent on the abilities and attitudes of the local level employees, arrangeme3nts will be made for upgrading their work- performance through training and career development opportunities. In spite of the slogans of balanced development having been raised even during the panchayat regime, development efforts were comparatively concentrated in developed and urban areas, which gave rise to great social and economic disparities among the regions. The wide disparity in economic and social facilities between the rural and urban areas has led to unprecedented increase in migration to urban areas. This has, on the one hand, exerted heavy pressure on drinking water supply system, education health care and transports and also led to greater pollution in urban area, while on the other, the economic and social conditions in the rural areas have further worsened. With a view to rectify these anomalies, in this context, complementary enterprises and economic activities compatible with the regional means and resources will be implemented. The balanced development of all sectors in equally important in view if the government’s commitment to rural development an d upliftment of the standard of living of the poor people. Regional development will be linked to the village level development and a suitable atmosphere for all citizens to share the returns of the nation’s investment will be created. To promote regional balance, special grants will be made available during the eighth plan for specific projects on addition to the lump sum government grants to the regions. The local bodies upon mutual consultations and agreement may use the funds thus provided for specified projects on the basis of regional necessities. The optimum utilization of regionally available means and resources will also enhance the national production. As agriculture is the backbone of the national economy and the livelihood of 90 percent of population is associated with this sector, the eighth plan lays special emphasis on the development and modernization of the agricultural sector. The agricultural development also deserves priority as this alone can increase the income of the common people and thereby expand internal maker for industrial sector. Low cost farming activities with higher rate of return such as intensive farming, horticulture, multiple crop farming, animal husbandry, bee keeping, sericulture, herbs and medicinal plant farming etc. will be promoted for the development of agricultural sector. At the same time, the genetic diversity of agricultural crops will be utilized for the development of export-oriented products. The diversification in agriculture will also assist in maintaining the ecological balance. A free, market-oriented liberal policy will be adopted in order to maintain an efficient flow and optimum utilization of resources in diverse agricultural activities. As mentioned above, the government does not believe in excessive government control in economic activities. The private sector, in a controlled economy, can not invest independently and make decisions concerning primary activities such as production and sale, which tends to direct the flow if investment not towards sustainable area but towards the areas that deliver short-term gains This leads to distortions in economy and the economy lose dynamism causing debility in economic structure. Controlled economic policed pursued by the panchayat regime in the past have given rise to distortions in the industrial structure as they promoted industrial and commercial activities which did not enhance any significant price value at the processing stage but were only profitable in the highly protected Indian market. Under such circumstances, while genuine entrepreneurs become discouraged, industrialists and traders, adept at exploiting non-transparent policies to their benefits, will have the upper hand. As such industrialists are more concerned with investing for short term personal gains rather than for long germ national economy. In view if these facts, the government will abandon the past policies of excessive control and intervention, and adopt open and liberal policies. Aware of the failure of the government sector all over the world in the production and delivery of goods through resource allocation, the government will assume the role of a catalyst and promote of private sector rather than controlling or interfering with their economic activities. Thus, limiting the scope of the government to some specific areas, the development and extension of all other areas will be left open to private sector. The principal role of the government will be to develop physical infrastructure necessary for economic development, such as roads and communications, to bring the people so far left out into the mainstream of development, by providing basic social services such as health care, education and drinking water, essential to the long-term national development, the participation of the private sector in these areas, too, will be welcomed, the government will initiate a process of disengagement and disinvestment from a number of areas that may be managed more efficiently by the private sector without jeopardizing social interests. In accordance with this policy, government owned enterprises and corporations will be gradually privatized. Sp ecial attention will be paid to protect private sector participation on various economic activities. In respect of several development activities, the private sector and non-governmental organizations can evidently be more effective in terms of cost, flexibility, motivation and initiative. The non -governmental organizations which are more motivated by social service then profit and also more experienced in working in close association with rural people, are better suited to the tasks of rural development and poverty alleviation. If these organizations are allowed to play and active role in rural development, there will emerge improvements in income distribution. Considering the fact that the non -governmental organizational and community organizations have been effectively engaged in rural development over the past several years, such organizations will be involved to the maximum possible extent in development activities during the eighth plan. For this purpose the government will remove the policy obstacles and hindrances being faced by these organizations and adopt promotional policies. The following will be undertaken to this end. a. \\tSimplification and clarification of administrative processes in order to private initiative from being suppressed. b. Removal of unnecessary delays to accelerate the government of government policies, and For the aforementioned purpose, plans are underway to review the license system and all other existing policies and regulations with a view to increasing the involvement of private sector and nongovernmental organizations in the economic development of the country. Laws and regulations r elating to registration and the structure of non-governmental organizations will be simplified and in order to make them capable of mobilizing internal resources to a greater extent, necessary improvements will be made in the legal provisions concerning taxation. Contact and communication with non -governmental organizations will be enhanced in order to understand their problems and provide necessary support. The non-governmental organizations will be given full autonomy to function in specific priority areas. To promote the initiative of private sector and non-governmental organizations in development works, the government will invest in transport, communications, energy, education and public health and develop infrastructure in various parts of the country. While formulating and executing the economic and social infrastructure for rural development through these organizations, particular attention will be paid to the interest of the entire village rather then to that of an individual. International non-governmental organizations have been playing a significant role over the pats several years in the development functions in Nepal. These organizations will be encouraged to work in areas where they can operate more effectively on the basis of their expertise, comparative advantages and recognition. The selection of areas will be made as far as possible in keeping with the policy of balanced regional development. As Nepal is a severely resource constrained country, it would not be an exaggeration to state that the development process can not be further advanced without foreign assistance. Reliance on foreign assistance without any concrete plan and without paying due attention to the optimum utilization of the assistance during the thirty years of the panchayat regime has given rise to many undesirable consequences placing the country unde3r the burden of foreign debts. Therefore, during the eighth plan period, foreign assistance will be sought only for such priority projects which may not be sustained through internal resources and due attention will be paid to ensuring the maximum effectiveness in the utilization of the assistance. Structural adjustment loans form t he World Bank and the international monetary fund will also be put to effective use. In this connection, the regular budget will be streamlined in respect of government expenditure, revenue will be increased through appropriate monetary and fiscal policies , the growth rate of money supply will be maintained within desirable limits and efforts will be made to increase exports through product diversification. These efforts will br ought stability to national economy and encourage private sector to increase inv estment in productive activities. Objectives and priorities of the Eighth Plan The broad objective of the eighth plan is to given definite direction to the social and economic upliftem ent of the citizens of the country by tackling the challenges of economic stagnation, increasing poverty, structural anomalies, environmental degradation and rapid population growth. A single five year plan can not find a remedy to all these problems but it is imperative to take concrete steps in that direction. The plan will make all possible efforts in this regard. The principal objectives that the plan aspires to achieve are as following: a. Sustainable economic growth b. Poverty alleviation, and c. \\tReduction of regional imbalances a. Sustainable Economic Growth One of the principal objectives of the plan is to achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic growth without which there is no possibility of achieving economic prosperity and its continuity. The economy will not be able to fulfill the developmental aspirations of the common people without a sustainable and high economic growth rate. The eight plans is determined to achieve a high growth rate and ensure its continuity objective of achieving a high & sustainable growth rate in the development efforts of the country. Sustainable economic growth also implies the management of the available bio-physical resources in the most productive manner without damaging or depleting these resources. The demand for such biophysical resources should not exceed their sustainable supply capacity. However, the present population of the country is already placing excessive demands on existing resources. If the present trend of population growth is allowed to continue, it will not be possible to meet the demands of the people without causing permanent damage to the bio-physical resources. Therefore, it is highly essential to reduce the rate of population growth in order to achieve a sustainable economic growth rate. To achieve the above mentioned objective, this plan has called for the involvement of private sector and increased people’s participation at the community level. The plan has made additional efforts to increase the productivity of the productivity of the labour force and to make the financial investment more productive. Similarly, programmes with higher comparative advantages will be implemented in agriculture, industry, tourism and other sectors. Comparative advantages can be achieved by the utilization of low cost hydro-electricity and other natural resources in the production process. This will produce a comparative advantages especially in energy -oriented industries and irrigated cultivable land. For this purpose, the advanced technology and institutional reforms will be made indispensable tools of support to the private sector and organizations down to the village level and production will be increased on the basis of equity and capability. Despite the development efforts of the past, the population living below the poverty line has been steadily increasing and the majority of such poverty ridden people live in the rural areas. The biggest challenge for the present government is to alleviate poverty from the rural sector. it is the root cause of many of the existing problems of Nepal such as population growth, environmental degradation and social anomalies. Therefore, another principal objective of this plan is to alleviate poverty. Although poverty is the result of diverse factors, the basic causes of poverty in Nepal are the dependence of the increasing population on limited economic resources and low rate of economic growth. The visible impediments to economic growth such as natural constraints, preliminary stage of development efforts, low productivity, subsistence agricultural system and slackness in the expansion of non-agricultural sector are the major factors for a weak economic base. In this perspective, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and inter -regional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and inter-regional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive assets base and additional employment opportunities to alleviate poverty, extension of social services like health education, vocational training and drinking water, and effective management and protection of natural resources. As part of the planning and implementation processes programmes will be implemented with the objective of benefiting the population living below the poverty line. c. \\tReduction of Regional Imbalances in Nepal, poverty has acquired spatial variations. Despite policy-pronouncements and efforts in the previous plans, disparities between rural and urban areas and among development regions have increased. Over the recent years, there has been an increased trend of migration from rural to urban areas. Hills to terai migration continue. Similarly, in comparison with other development regions, far western region and mid western region lag far behind in respect of infrastructural and social service facilities and other development works. The living standard of the people of these regions have adversely affected by the growing disparity of income distribution caused by these factors. This has further complicated the creation of equal opportunities for sharing development benefits. In this context, maintenance of regional balance forms another objective of he Eighth plan. While allocating resources in order to achieve regional balance, due attention has been paid to the necessity of creating physical infrastructure in these less developed regions. With this objective, while special emphasis has been given on the extension of rural roads, due importance has been attached to the provision of facilities like primary heath care, education and drinking water in rural sector. The regional complementary interrelationships between the hills and the Terai arising out of the existing agro-ecological conditional can be beneficially utilized for agricultural and industrial specialization. Therefore, the current and future development perspectives will be accorded special emphasis in order to benefit from the ecological interrelationships between the Hills and Terai. Focusing on the development of less development regions, special emphasis will be laid on the reduction of regional imbalances. In order to achieve the principal objectives mentioned above, it has become essential to improve economic standard of rural people the achieve self-sustaining rural development through the increased provision of social, economic and market services, and increased access to drinking water and alternative forms of energy. Priorities In view of the limited financial, human and institutional resources of the country, it will not be possible to provide adequate resources to all activities within a single plan period. This plan will in the course of resource allocation, accord priority to such programmes whose completion provides necessary support to another or those which have a high economic benefit. The programmes receiving priority in this plan are: (a) \\tAgricultural Intensification and Diversification: it is being increasingly realized that the contribution of agriculture to the overall economic development of the nation is not only determined by the growth rate of agriculture but also by its pattern. In a development system that encompasses the majority of the population, a greater numger of producers including the marginal ones can have access to the increased rural income. The demands of such producers are usually related to the goods and services which uses maximum local resources and labour. For the attainment of equitable economic development, it is necessary to accelerate demands for labour and to expedite food supply. The agricultural sector alone contributes about three fifths of the gross national product and provides employment to nearly eight tenths of the entire population. Agriculture is that sector which will be able to involve, although only for a short or medium period, the rapidly increasing labour force in productive activities. As there are severe limitations on expanding the cultivable land, this plan has accorded priority to agricultural intensification and diversification. With adequate provisions of necessary agricultural support services, intensive farming will be introduced in areas with access to irrigation facilities. In such areas, the emphasis will mainly be laid on cereal production. In order to meet the urban demand for milk, eggs, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, priority will be given to intensive productions programmes in areas adjacent to the cities and along road corridors to urban areas. Sericulture, bee keeping medicinal herb farming and similar significant but low-cost small -scale activities will be encouraged to increase the income of the farmers in the hills and the mountains. Energy plays an important role in the economy, in respect of both domestic and exports sectors of the economy. Although the country is well endowed with abundant biomass and hydropower resources, the pace of industrialization is felt to have slowed down in the recent year mainly because of the lack of energy and power. While it implies that rapid industrial growth is not possible without tackling the energy constraints, the growth of agricultural production may be impeded by the lack of energy for life-irrigation and processing of agricultural products. If an elementary machinery lick water million, diesel engine and bio-gas plants could be developed in the rural areas, it will contribute immensely to the development of food processing industries and cottage industries. Nepal’s vast potential to generate comparatively cheap hydropower provides comparative advantages in many energy through modern technology and its integration with the development of other sectors of the economy can enhance sectoral productivity as well as comparative advantages. For instance, it will be possible to transfer the traditional agricultural pattern to modern agricultural system through the use of electricity in lift irrigation, making use of technology and fertilizers. This will lead to a considerable increase in agricultural productivity as well as a decrease in foreign currency expenditure for the import of diesel. All these considerations clearly indicate that energy development should be accorded high priority in Nepal’s development planning. c. \\tDevelopment of Rural Infrastructure in order to support industrial growth, the market for industrial production will be expanded in rural areas by providing roads and other forms of transportation linking rural communities and market centres. Necessary infrastructure will be built for the development of rural irrigation, drinking water, electricity, communications, rural industries and tourism etc. providing the basic facilities of life such as suspension bridges, schools and health care, the environment in the villages will be made comfortably in the rural areas. The rural development infrastructure will provide employment opportunities to the growing labour force of the rural sector. Therefore, this plan has accorded high priority to the creation of the entire infrastructure if rural development. The creation of productive employment opportunities in the country has been given top priority by this plan. In order to create employment opportunities at an accelerated rate, all possible avenues have been explored in the sectoral programmes. Since nearly 90 percent of the population live in rural areas, the plan has laid special emphasis on generating greater employment opportunities in rural areas. Thus, the plan has emphasized on bigger investment in rural areas for the development of non-agricultural activities such as development and renovation of infrastructure, expansion of agriculture through the use of electricity and cottage industries based on local energy resources. This plan has made arrangements of adequate resources of further productive involvement of the existing human resources in the efforts of national development. Since the existing labour force is largely illiterate and unskilled, basic education and technical and vocational training opportunities will be expanded with particular emphasis on rural areas. e. \\tControl of Population Growth the available resources in the country cannot forever sustain the current rate of population growth. The rapid increase in population leaves only an insignificant portion of resources for development works. There can be no prospect for a substantial increase in the average income of the people if the population is allowed to grow at the present rate. Therefore, the reduction in the rate of population growth is one of the priority areas of this plan. The family planning devices are still not readily available in various parts of the country. It has been proved that family planning devices are being used only in areas with the spread of literacy among women and with easy access to primary health facilities, and in families with high standard of living. Therefore, this plan has placed special emphasis on the awareness creation programmes to increase in the demand for family planning devices. f. \\tIndustrial Development and Tourism Promotion Economic prosperity depends upon a rapid sustainable economic development. For the attainment of accelerated economic development in the country, industrialization is equally as important as that of agriculture and other primary sectors. The industrialization, in the process of value added contributes, to the creation of new employment opportunities and economic integration. The eight h plan policies have been so formulated that they will promote the sustainable growth of large as well as cottage industries. During this plan period, an atmosphere favourable to the open and competitive growth of industries will be created and expanded. The private sector as well as foreign investors will be particularly encouraged through appropriate policy measures to invest in the industrial sector. Similarly, tourism sector will be promoted in order to generate increased foreign exchange, employment and income. However, owing to the constraints in the supply of necessary commodities and insufficient and incompatible initiatives, tourism has so far been a seasonal phenomenon and has not been able to make the desired headway. In order to make use of  all feasible development prospects, the eights plan has accorded special priority to the overall development of this sector. The government will invest in the creation of infrastructure of industry and tourism, and provide support to the private sector. Policies will be continued to be effectively implemented so as to induce the domestic and foreign investors to increases their investment with confidence and to generate higher returns as cooperated to the rate of investment. In this connection, some pioneering steps have already been taken with regard to policy matter. g. \\tExport promotion and Diversification The rapid widening of trade and current account deficits in recent years has become a matter of serious concern to the country. the complications in the export of traditional and some new kinds of manufactured goods and the quantitative decline in the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the export base of Nepal. The market available to Nepalese exporters in limited. These factors have impeded the attainment of stability in the growth of export. Although the carpet and garment industries have re3corded a significant growth in export earnings over the recent years, in views of quality control, proper organizational structure, large scale production and innovations in the production patterns, it is necessary to improve the quality standards of the products for markets to which they have been usually exported. New products have not been successfully identified as yes for export promotion programmes. The growth of the export sector has been restricted due to the lack of clear-cut export policies and low priority accorded to it in the past. The eighth plan has given priority to the production and promotion of both traditional agricultural commodities and new exportable products. This plan has adopted the strategy of promoting market oriented production which will contribute to the development of production as well as market facilities. h. \\tMacro-Economic Stabilization The expansionary policy adopted in the past has given rise to excessive liquidity, increasing money supply, increasing trade imbalance and high price rise. This has weakened the stability of the economy. Under the given circumstances, the policies of macro economic stabilization and structural adjustments can play a significant role in the attainment of the objective of stability in economic growth rate. In this connection, the plan has given special emphasis to a more rational allocation of resources, better management of public expenditures, enhanced mobilization of internal resources, greater performance in public sector investment and the strengthening of public enterprises, open and simple foreign exchange policies and regulations, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Due emphasis has been given on the reinforcement of the present financial system in order to further mobilize savings in the private sector. Encouragement has been provided to the establishment of new financial institutions and the development of capital markets. Exploration of new methods of saving has been encouraged by removing the control of the central bank on the fixation of interest rates. The increasing proportion of administrative cost in development investment and slow decision making processes have led delays in the projects implementation. As the employees in public sectors consume, even at the existing low salary scales., a major share of the government revenue only a meager portion of it is available of capital investment. The lack of a suitable working atmosphere, the gradual decline in the morale of civil servants and the lack of the sense of responsibility can be cited as examples of additional constraints. There is a treat need for reforms in the exi sting system of recruitment, positing, training and promotion. During this plan period, reforms through appropriate measures will be introduced in order to make the development administration capable enough to meet the challenges of national development. j. Monitoring and Evaluation While the planned projects are not usually implemented on time, the project subsequent to their implementation, too, have failed to produce the desired result. This has led to a disparity between planning and implementation, and between implementation and achievements, which have been a matter of great concern to the government as well as donor countries. In such grave circumstances, the government has fully understood the need for institutionalization of the monitoring and evaluation systems with respect to development projects and programmes. During the plan period, an effective monitoring and evaluation system will be devised and institutionalized, which will not only ensure the timely implementation of projects but also encourage management accountability and performance oriented evaluation system in the public sector. Economic Growth Rate, Total Investment And Sectoral Allocations Macro economic bases of Eighth Plan Consistency among objectives, policies, programmes and investment must be established in the course of formulating a plan. Moreover, due attention must be paid in the plan to the appropriate allocation of resources and the methods of their effective utilization. With a view to eliminating the disparity between investment plan and targets and making the plan more realistic, the plan should frame an investment programme using appropriate techniques, based on the proper assessment of all viable alternatives, Similarly, and estimate needs to be made with regard to the availability of resources as well as the growth rate likely to be achieved during the plan period on the basis of alternative sectoral plans. In the past, the plans did not pay required attention to these aspects, nor was an appropriate planning methodology used, The economic growth rate was determined in the initial stage of planning based on external variables. Therefore, the extent if requisite investment of the plan was fixed on the basis of crude incremental capital output ratios. This methodology did not pay due at tention of the need to establish coordination between various internal and external variables. This was a closed economy concept, which disregards the analysis of interrelationships among diverse economic areas. There were particularly there vita flaws in this methodology. Firstly, the fact that the availability of resources is determined by the implementation of the plan and the economic achievement to be made during the plan period was neglected. This led to arbitrary estimates of resources likely to be available in the plan period. Secondly, as this methodology fixes the investment requirement based in incremental capital output ration with total disregard to economy in sectoral allocations and better result-oriented standards, it can not be utilized in the evaluation of alternative resource allocations and in the analysis of the effects of alternative investment plan on production, employment and other variables as a whole. Thirdly, it does not help in the analysis of programmes and alternative policies, and in the assessment and formulation of these programmes and policies in the perspective of attaining total objective The techniques of macro-model have been employed in the formulation of the Eighth Plan. This helps to assess the probable effects of alternative investment programme on the economy. According to this methodology. a. The total and sectoral value added has been determined within the framework of the model and the fact that the total and sectoral investment has a decisive impact on the overall economic growth rate has been taken into consideration. b. The total sectoral demands for labour are primarily determined by the growth rates of production in various sectors. c. \\tBudgetary deficit, monetary and structural variables of the economy cause monetary expansion and price determination. Budgetary deficit affects imports as well as balance of payments, which is a peculiar characteristic of a small economy like our. d. \\tTotal investment is fixed by the extent of external and internal savings, and thus in turn, by the supply of investment resources too. e. \\tThe sectoral incremental capital output rations have been estimated on the basis of internal processes of the model. This will assist in the assessment of the probable effects of alternative investment programmes on medium term economic growth and short term economic stability. This will also facilitate the evaluation of the impact on the economy of the growth of economic efficiency created by the sectoral policy measures such as appropriate regional allocation of resources, selection of suitable projects and monitoring system, prudent economic management, economic openness and privatization. The modeling technique will make it possible to assess the prevailing or the likely negative influence on the economy of low productivity, supply and structural constraints, lack of prudence in the allocation and utilization of resources and the unnecessary government interfence in various economic sectors. Likewise this will also help in evaluating the probable effects on the economy from the probable growth in saving brought about by the favourable changes in the internal and external economic environment, reduction in unproductive government expenditure and the accelerated growth of investment in industries. Thus, there is a great need for additional reforms in spite of the various reforms proposed in this plan period. The modeling technique adopted in the Eighth plan cannot contribute much to the task of evaluating interregional relationships and the flow of regional means and resources, as it is devoted to the analysis of cumulative constraints as a whole. Therefore, the National planning commission has accorded priority to the collection of additional data and the extension of planning methodology. This will facilitate the further analysis of various aspects of interregional relations in the future. Police Bases In the past, there existed a vast gulf between the target and the achievements of the plans. In the absence of appropriate policy, strategy and programmes, the economy became increasingly cost oriented and the government expenditure was getting more inclined toward unproductive sectors, difficult to be sustained by the economy. The increasing government participation and interference and the lack of a favorable atmosphere for the involvement of private sector also contributed to the slow growth of the industrial sector. The major share of the private sector was attracted towards the unproductive areas such as real estate. The increased loss in the government owned corporations, the excessive expansion of the government expenditures and the excessive dependence in deficit budgeting for compensatory measures created greater impediments to the task of promoting medium and long term development programmes, gradually imparting stability to the economy at the same time. Therefore, the greatest challenge now is to devise ways and means of discouraging these trends and steering the economy in the direction of more productive and sustainable economic development through appropriate policy reforms. The nation faces the complex challenges of accelerating the economic development, alleviating poverty and reducing regional imbalances and raising the living standard if the people in a short period through and extensive increase in employment opportunities against the backdrop of the scarcity of means and resources. Therefore, the Eights plan has adopted in its formulation some policy bases such as the allocation of investment in high productive areas in keeping with the priorities accorded by the plan; the attainment of performance efficiency in industry, communications, trade, hotel keeping, finance and real estate, through appropriate management of government expenditure; control of government expenses; introduction of suitable selection process and work-performance monitoring systems in the formulation and implementation of the plan; promotion of private sector involvement in the economy through economic liberalization and privatization and maintenance of proper balance and coordination among economic growth rate, availability of resources and other macro variables. Economic Growth Rate On the basis of an extensive evaluation of the alternative investment programmes and policies to be adopted by the plan, it is estimated that a 5.1 percent average annual growth rate will be achieved during the Eighth Plan period (table 1). This growth rate is higher than that of the last three decades. The average long term growth rate in domestic product was merely 3 percent and this was responsible for the lack of growth in per capital inco me. In view if the disappointing state if the per capital income and the increase in poverty, it has become imperative to achieve higher economic growth rate for the amelioration of the standard of living of the common people. Although this growth rate would seem ambitious in the light of past experiences, it will be possible to achieve the above mentioned growth rate in the new political and economic environment. The appropriate utilization of the existing infrastructure of the economy will also contribute to the increase in the growth rate of gross domestic product. Similarly, the prospective growth in the rate of private savings and the curtailment of unproductive government spending will provide additional help in increasing the economic growth rate. Furthermore, the achievement of the above growth rate alone will ensure additional advantages to the economy and provide a sound basis for further accelerated economic growth rate and an increase in additional employment opportunities in future. The estimated growth rate of the eighth plan con not be considered unduly high in comparison with the high growth rates achieved by developing nations through economic liberalization. The appropriate allocations and utilization of resources, economic liberalization and other policy reforms will contribute further towards the attainment of the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent in the Eighth plan period. On the assumption that the rate of population growth will be 2.1 percent during the plan period, the above economic growth rate will result in a three -fold increase over previous per-capita growth rates or a three percent annual growth in per capital income. During the plan period, the above economic growth rate will be achieved by increasing productivity, by exercising greater discipline in government expenditure, and by implementing policy reforms which will attract the private sector investment in the fields of industry, trade, finance and sp on. An analysis conducted on the basis of the current extent of available foreign aid indicates that extensive improvements in work performance and considerable increase in domestic savings must be achieved in order to further increase the economic growth rate. Although foreign debts can substitute for the difference between investment and savings, they may have adverse effect on the payment of principal and interest and inflation. The above growth rate also appears to be an appropriate proposition on the basis of the capabilities of the economy and the uncertainties as to the mode of implementation of economic liberalization by the countries with which there are regional trade relations. In order the achieve the targeted value added growth rate in the Eighth plan period, a 5.1 percent growth rate in the gross domestic product will be achieved by means of a 3.7 percent increase in agricultural value added and a 6.1 percent increase in non-agricultural value added. The higher non-agricultural value added in comparison to the agricultural one will lead to structural changes in the economic by the final year of the plan. As shown in table 1, the share of non -agricultural sector will rise from 44.5 percent in 1991/92 to 47.3 percent in 1996/97. Although the gr owth rate which appears in the structure of domestic product will be only marginal and the agricultural sector continues to hold the major share up to the end of the plan period, these changes will certainly contribute to the creation of new employment opportunities and an accelerated growth in the non-agricultural production. The estimated economic growth rates indicate a progressive upward trend in the rate of growth in the economy. Total investment Requirement for the plan period and sectoral Allocation of Resources: As mentioned above, the size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns, growth in productivity, the control in government expenditure and the policies encouraging the diversion of private sector savings to productive sectors will contribute to the attainment of a 5.1 percent economic growth rate. The estimated sectoral allocation of investment is based on a detailed analysis of existing and potential capit al productivity in eight major sectors of economy. Compared to the seventh plan, a slight increase is proposed in the sectoral shares of investment in agriculture, irrigation, forestry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services. There are three fundamental grounds for the proposed investment  pattern. Firstly, the selection of appropriate projects and new policies of evaluation will give rise to increased efficiency in various sectors. The national planning commission will have to play a significant role in the upgrading of such efficiency. The application of new policies and methods of the selection of projects and evaluation, in particular, will result in economy in investment, and the investment units in various sectors will help the growth of production in those areas. Secondly, the policy of economic liberalization will direct the flow of resources to productive sectors such as agriculture, industry, trade and tourism. Thus, the share of industrial sector in total investment will rise to an average of 8.8 percent in the Eighth plan from the 7.7 percent average of the seventh plan. Similarly, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry will increase to 25.8 percent for 24.5 and this increase will have been made possible mainly by the development programmes related to rural development. Thirdly, as the Eighth Plan lays special emphasis on rural development, there will be a considerable increase in people’s participation and the contribution of labour. Therefore, in spite of the lack of larger financial investment, there will be a higher generation of capital in these sectors. The total gross investment outlay for the eighth Plan period is estimated to be Rs 170,332 million (Table2). This estimate is based on the assumption that there will be an improvement over the past incremental capital output ration of 4.5:1 to 4.3:1. the incremental capital output ration is estimated to be as decline because of the projected better results of expenditures in governmental sectors to be made possible by the policy of economic liberalization in the private sector, and appropriate selection of projects, budget, expenditure, management and monitoring systems. As shown in Table 2, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry in total investment will reach 25.8 percent. Similarly, compared to the seventh Plan, the investment share of industry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services will also increase in the eight plan. The proposed size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns will primarily contribute to the increase in the aggregate and secotral production growth rates. Similarly, the growth of efficiency in some sectors, too, will cause a marginal decline in the incremental capital output ratio. Out of the total gross fixed investment of Rs 170,332 million, Rs 109,193 million (64.1 Percent) will be invested by the private sector while the remaining Rs 61,139 million (55.9 Percent) will be invested by the government sector (table3). In the seventh plan the amount of total investment stood at Rs 103, 014 million at 1991/92 prices. Thus, compared to the seventh plan, investment during the eighth plan period will have to be increased by 10.6 percent per annum. Although this rate appears to be fairly high compared to that of other least developed nations, considering that the Eighth plan has been initiated at a time when there in a limited capital base, it will be possible to increase the investment at the above mentioned rate. The new environment created by liberal economic policies will also promote the increase of the investment growth rate. In the seventh plan, the share of government sector stood at 41 percent of gross fixed investment, which will come down to 35.9 percent in the Eighth plan. It is expected that the  adoption of liberal economic policies will increase the growth rate of investment from the private sector. Thus, the share of the private sector investment is estimated to reach 64.1 of gross fixed investment during the Eighth plan period. Although a total investment of Rs 61,139 million is proposed for the public sector, it will be necessary to spend development out lay equivalent to Rs 113.479 million during the Eighth Plan period. As shown in Talbe 4, of the total development outlay of 113,479 million, social services and agriculture, irrigation and forestry sectors will receive a higher share of the total development outlay (31.5 and 25.7 percent respectively) followed by electricity (20.9 percent) and transport and communications (17.7 percent). A detailed sectoral breakdown of the total development outlay is presented in table 5. the differences in the shares of sectoral gross fixed investment in total development outlay are caused by the differences in the nature of the programmes proposed in various sectors. Sources of Investment Out of the total fixed capital investment of Rs 170,323 million, 56.3 percent (Rs 95,977 million) will be borne thought national savings. Of the remaining 43.7 percent (Rs74,355 million) 26.6 percent (Rs 19,761 million) will be financed through foreign grants and 73.4 percent (Rs 54,594 million) through external loans. From the table, it clearly appears that ins spite of high priority accorded to private sector investment, the private sector’s savings in likely to exceed its investment amount. However, despite the reduced investment, there may be considerable negative savings accumulation in the public sector. The expansion of the public sector and the uncontrolled inclusion of numerous projects during the panchayat regime have led to the continuity of an expenditure burden in the initial years of the eighth plan entailing a continued increase in government expenditure and negative savings. The almost unsustainable upward trend in negative savings appears to have gained impetus during the last decade of the panchayat regime and the main contributing factor for this is a great increase in the unproductive and consumption expenditure of the public sector. Although the size of negative savings is expected to reduce towards the end of the plan upon gradual improvements over the budgeting and accounting systems used in regular and development budgets, it will take a number of years to make the public sector capable of generating savings. As shown in table6, the negative savings during the Eighth plan will be, more or less, equivalent to 34.5 percent of the gross fixed capital investment of the public sector. At the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent, the government revenue will increase by 9.7 percent, but the share of negative savings will continue to be high due to its increasing trend in the past. The deficit between the public sector negative savings and investment will be borne thorough foreign assistance and internal borrowing. Internal loans will primarily be arranged from private sector saving, which will facilitate the control of money supply and price level. A little different picture emerges when the level of development outlay and sources of financing are analyzed. As shown in table 7, during the Eighth plan, the share of revenue surplus in development outlay will remain 27.5 percent and the share of foreign aid will be maintained at 65.5 percent. Only 7,5 percent will be borne through internal borrowing. Macroeconomic Impact of total and Sectoral Investment The reallocation in sectoral investment and economy in resource utilization, accompanied by liberal economic policies, will not only help achieve higher growth rates but also increase employment opportunities and maintain economic stability during the plan Period. Besides, the creation of a favorable environment for private sector will also stimulate growth in domestic savings. As shown in table 8, gross domestic savings will rise from 9.5% of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the plan period in 1996/97. the deficit finance will be reduced from 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to less than one percent of GDP by the end of the Eight plan. Similarly, the current account deficit will also be reduced from 9.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 8.0 percent in 1996/97. The share of government consumption is expected to increase only moderately from 11.5 percent of the  gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product in 1996/97. The increase in money supply during the plan period will be lim ited to 12.1 percent per annum, which will help in limiting inflation to about 9 percent. The policy and structural reforms to be adopted during the plan period do not permit any great reduction in the average rate of inflation. During the eighth plan period, the rate of inflation will be maintained below 9 percent in average by reducing the increasing liquidity of the economy and by adopting other appropriate monetary and fiscal policy measures. Manpower demand during the plan period will record a growth at the rate of 3.1 percent per annum. This increase in manpower demand in expected to take place as a result of the increase in investment in different sectors of the economy and the subsequent rise in value added. The increased demand in the labour force during the eighth plan period is expected to reach over 1.4 million jobs. Thus, the macroeconomic implications of total and sectoral investment outlay indicate that, provided the proposed policies and programmes are effectively implemented in time, they will be able to contribute in constantly raising the economic growth rate, maintaining economic stability and alleviating poverty through the extension of employment opportunities. In the pas t, the Nepalese economy remained considerably weak in matters of achieving higher economic growth rate and maintaining stability. The declining productivity in the government sectors, the reduction in the share of domestic savings in gross domestic product and the flow of a major share of total private sector investment towards unproductive capital sector such as real estate also have created several problems in the economy. Therefore, in order to raise the productivity of the government sector, special emphasis will have to be given on the method of selecting appropriate projects, appropriate pricing policy, reformative institutionalized systems of monitoring and evaluation and the privatization of government undertakings. It is necessary to promote productive investment policies which encourage the private sector to save and to direct their investment from the unproductive sector like real estate to the sectors capable of achieving higher economic growth rate such as industry. The emphasis on efficient and economic-growth oriented sectors and the subsequent desirable structural changes in the eighth plan will provide considerable advantages to the economy during and even after the eighth plan period. A s the returns from investment take long time to materialize, the policy reforms and the structural changes in the eighth plan are confidently expected to increase the work-performance of the economy particularly in the later years of the plan and thereafter. Estimates of Development Materials Following is the estimated requirement of construction and development materials during the plan period for development programmes to be implemented during the Eighth plan. Cement: It is estimated that in order to undertake of iron rode, sections, channels, corrugated and ordinary roofing sheets in expected to be 669,000 metric tons during the Eighth plan period. Although the total installed capacity of the industries producing these materials is 229, 000 metric tons per annum, they are found to be operating at only 25 percent of their installed capacity. Bricks: An estimated requirement of 8,800 million bricks for the eighth plan is exp ected to be met by the production of the industries in the public as well as private sectors. It is estimated that government agencies will be able to supply a total of 15,850 million cubic feet of timber of different types during the plan period. Polythene pipes: In view if the policy of expanding drinking water facilities, there will be an increase in the use of polythene pipes in the plan period. Accordingly, 17,000 metric tons of polythene pipes are estimated to be put into use during this plan period. The requirement of chemical fertilizers for the Eighth plan is estimated to be 916,000 metric tons the total requirement of chemical fertilizers in the country is being met through import. The items under mineral oils are petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, aviation fuel, light diesel oil, furnace oil, L.P. gas, and bitumen etc. A total of 1,993,000 kilo liters of petroleum products in estimated to be required during the Eighth plan period. The entire requirement of these products will have to be met through import. A project has been initiated in view of the natural gas deposits found at different places in the Kathmandu valley. Coke and Coal: The estimated consumption of coke and coal for the eighth plan is 1,113,000 metric tons, which is expected to be met through import. The consumption of writing and printing paper during the eighth plan is estimated to be 121,000 metric tons. out of this requirement, 21 percent only is expected to be met through the production of Bhrikuti paper factory and Everest paper mills. News print: During the Eighth plan period, the demand for newsprint in estimated to be 18,000 metric tons the entire demand is expected to be met through import. Explosives: The estimated demand for explosives during the eighth plan period is 1,400 metric tons. The requirement is expected to be met even through the production of the factory of the Royal Nepalese Army. Irrigation plays a key role in the development of agricultural sector which has remained the backbone of the country\\'s economy. Although agriculture sector contributes the most to gross national production, the development in irrigation has been less than expected. The agriculture sector has still to rely largely on rainfall. Frequent drought and excessive rain have hampered the actual growth of agricultural reduction on one and, while on the other, the rapid population growth has led to a situation of food import for meeting the growing demand. In this context, it has become essential to emphasize on the irrigation development for increased agricultural production from the limited 1and with the use of surface and groundwater resources available in the country. While planning for irrigation development, it is also necessary to maintain co-ordination between irrigation and agricultural production programmes towards achieving maximum benefit. It has also become important to entrust full responsibility of the operation and management of irrigation systems to user farmers after soliciting their organised participation in the identification, feasibility studies, selection and implementation of irrigation systems. Progress during the Seventh Plan: Department of Irrigation and Agriculture Development Bank have together developed irrigation facilities in 179,337 ha of land during the Seventh Plan period. Similarly, an additional 48,337 ha has been developed during the two years interim period of FY 1990/1991 and 1991/1992. It is estimated that a tota1 of 598,804 ha of land will have received irrigation facility by t he end of FY 1991/1 92.Fu11 detail are given in Table 1. Existing Problems: Construction work of big projects planned to provide irrigation facility to large areas not being completed in time and completed projects not operating in full capacity. 6. Inadequate participation of Nongovernmental Organisations and the private sectors in the implementation of irrigation projects. 7. Farmer\\'s inability to derive expected benefits from the project s due to project implementing government agency\\'s lack of direct accountability towards the people. 8. Unsustainability of the projects due to the lack of necessary attention towards the institutional aspects during the execution of the programme by the government agency. Considering the above problems, necessary measures will be taken to complete the irrigation projects within the allocated time during the Eighth Plan period. Priority will be given to the construction of low-cost projects for their sustained operation through maximum mobilisation of available resources with the participation of government and semi-government organisations and private and non-government sector . Adequate measures will be effected in the promotion and extension of appropriate technology including irrigation management improvement. Background of the Eighth Plan: Development and expansionu of irrigation facilities is essential for increasing agricultural production required to ensure economic growth and security in food supply. In spite of huge past investment made in this sector, farming still depends, to a large extent, on rainfa11 . Furthermore, even the completed projects have not been possible to be fully utilised. Every year,there is a need to make huge investment on the repair, maintenance and operation of large projects. But these projects have not enable to provide irrigation facilities to the farmers on time. Besides, in the context of large under construction now being cost ineffective from financial perspective, doubt has been raised about the validity of their implementation. The very name \"irrigation\" has appeared to be synonymous with a viscious cycle of construction, non-operation and again reconstruction. Such a state of counterproductive investments in irrigation sector is sure to make a negative impact on the national economy. Because of the fact that most of the small irrigation systems are operate by farmers, it seems desirable to pay special attention to such projects as can be managed and operated by themselves. The costs per hectare of some of the government constructed projects are found to range from Re. Also observed are the costs per hectare of projects constructed with the participate on of farmers to be ranging from Re. 8,000 to Rs 25,000. The latter seem be sustainable as repair, maintenance and operation works in such projects are carried out by the users themselves. Climatological conditions vary across different parts of the country due to the country\\'s physiographic. It has, therefore, become very essential to maintain co-ordination between the choice of crops and the provision of irrigation facility. In the same vein, it is necessary to develop and extend small irrigation systems that conform to the country\\'s physiographic and cause minimum adverse impact on the environment. objective: Irigation projects in the Eighth Plan will be implemented to achieve the following objectives: 2. To increase agricultural production and productivity by improving the man agreement of existing irrigation systems to bring about increased reliability in irrigation management. 3. To provide maximum irrigation facility by implementing financially, technically and environmentally sustainable and cost effective projects with farmers participation. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, development and extension of irrigation facilities will be undertaken on the basis of following priorities: 1. Projects costing less per hectare and projects requiring minimum government involvement in repair and maintenance. 2. Projects guaranteeing high people\\'s participation; projects that can be implemented, operated and maintained by users themselves; and projects requiring minimum government investment. 3. Projects more likely to benefit small farmers and backward communities. 4. Projects yielding quick returns. 5. Projects constructed in the past which now remain non-operational and can be rehabilitated at low cost with the organised participation of farmers. 6. Multipurpose projects of national importance. 7. Irrigation projects in under-construction stage. Policies: Following Policies will be pursued for achieving the irrigation targets set: 1. Projects with less cost per hectare will be selected after the survey of potential projects requested by the farmer. While planning any irrigation project, users will be involved in every step right from project initiation. Same procedure will be followed for repair and maintenance as well. 2. Public communication means will be used while implementing the programme with a view to provide equa1 opportunity to all for participation. 3. Additional investment in projects under construction stage for many years and those with high cost per hectare will be made only after their thorough re evaluation. 4. Farmers\\' field channels will continue to be improved with the users\\' participation by arranging necessary technical assistance. Besides, tube wells and Wells constructed in the past will be renovated as needed. 5. Necessary arrangements will be made to avail electricity and drinking water from the small irrigation systems, if found feasible to do so. 6. Private sector will be encouraged to actively involve in the development and expansion of irrigation facility. 7. Joint management system will be applied for involving the users in the management of multipurpose, large an medium projects with special emphasis given on irrigation management training institutional development at the farmers\\' level and access to technical services. 8. Encouragement will be given for the operation of government constructed project s commanding over 2,000 ha in the Terai and 500 ha in the Hills under the joint management of the responsible government agency and the users\\' committee. 9. Government constructed projects commanding less than 2,000 ha in the Terai and 500 he in the Hills will continue to be handed over to the ser committees. 10. Semi-government organisations, users\\' committees, private sector and nongovernmental organisations will be encouraged to be involved in the construction of small irrigation projects. 11. Conjunctive use of groundwater will be encouraged to be used in areas not irrigable round the year by surface system only. 12. Construction expenses of small and medium projects will be jointly borne by His Majesty\\'s Government and the users. 13. Lift irrigation powered by electricity, bio-gas and wind wi11 be encouraged where feasible power in order to reduce dependence on imported fuel. 14. The users associations and committees will be mandatorily involved in the co, lection of water fees in order to instill self-reliance in projects to be operated at the government level and under joint management. 15. Water cess will be levied only when services are actually provided to the farmers. 16. Priority will be given to the installation of shallow tubewell s in areas where shallow aquifers exist. The insta11 at, on of the tubewells will be gradually be transferred from the government to the private sector. Ground water exploration, feasibility study and monitoring in will be carried out on a priority basis. Arrangements wi11 be made to avai1 information relating to groundwater to concerned District Development Committees, District Irrigation offices and other agencies. 17 \\tFeasibility study reports prepared to date will be made available to the District Irrigation Office and the indices of such reports will be made available to the concerned District Development Committee and users \\' committees. 18. Sprinkler irrigation will be encouraged in the hilly region in an extensive manner on the basis of feasibility - Where feasible, lift irrigation schemes will be operated by electricity available from the small hydroe1ectric project. 19. While executing the small irrigation projects, the concerned agency will have to explain clearly about cash voluntary labour and repair and maintenance expenses to be borne by the users \\' committee, and should execute the project after getting written agreement from them on these provisions, Construction expenses of the project will be operated by joint signature of the person nominated by the users’ committee and the technical representative of the executing agency. It will be mandatory to get the decision of the user\\'s committee if any part of the project needs to be awarded to a contractor. 20. Irrigation programme will be implemented in accordance with Irrigation Policy 1992\", High priority has been given to peoples\\' participation in the Eighth Plan. Arrangements will be made to clearly determine people’s participation while implementing any project. When implementing any project , a fixed sum of money will be borne by His Majesty\\'s Government and the rest by the users\\' committee. 21. Specified management expenses will be made available to be implemented in order solicit increased participation of the semi-governmental organisation, the non-governmental association/ organisation and the private agency. Research \\ton promotion and extension of the irrigation technology will be initiated during the plan period to implement the irrigation project through the nongovernmental organization, private entrepreneurs and the users also in areas where service cannot be rendered, according to the demand of the farmers due to the institutional problems of the government and semi government agencies. 22. For this purpose, the non -governmental organisation, the private enterprise firm and the users committee registered at national or district level will be encouraged to get involved in the development of the irrigation sector. 23. Research, promotion and extension of the irrigation technology will be carried out through the government and semi-government organisations. Target and Programme: The total, physical target of the under construction project included in the plan period is 135,250 ha of which  120,690 ha, will receive irrigation facility by FY 1996/97. The proposed w projects with a total physical target of 81,400 ha to be initiated during the plan period will be implemented with a view to provide irrigation facility to 39,292 ha of land within the plan period. Similarly, an additional 1,150 ha will be irrigated through feasible and continuing projects. The irrigation programme to be implemented by the Agriculture Development Bank will command 119,700 ha. Besides this, a total of 13,063 ha will receive irrigation facility by he projects be implemented through the non -governmenta1 organisation and the private sector. in this way, the total area to be irrigated from the new and continuing projects during the p Ian period will be about 293,895 ha. Irrigation facility will be made available to 132,763 ha of land from the irrigation projects of short gestation. Irrigation facility will be available to 52,650 ha of land from the medium and small irrigation projects (ILC and ISP). Irrigation facility will be available to 108,482 ha and 185,413 ha of land respectively from the large and the small irrigation project. Additional irrigation facility will be available to 293,895 ha. f land during the plan period from different sources – the surface, the underground and the unidentifiable sources contributing 204,955; 87,790 and 1,150 hectares respectively. The total irrigated area will thus reach 892,699 ha by the end of the plan period. In order to achieve the aforementioned target, the following programmes will be implemented: Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project (Second Phase): Though initially targeted to provide irrigation facility to 66,000 ha of land in Sunsari and Morang districts, this project is providing partial irrigation facility to only 20,000 ha due to lack of command area development various other technical problems. Sedient control and additional improvement works in the Chatra main canal will be undertaken during the plan period as the people has lost effectiveness due to sediment entry in large quantities into the canal system from the river intake. Irrigation facility will be provided to 9,750 ha com and area from the facilities constructed during the first phase of the programs. With the completion of second phase of the programs, irrigation facility will be provided to a total of 16,700 ha of land. Bagmati Irrigation Project (First Phase): Work was started to provide seasonal irrigation to 68,000 he of land in the districts of Bara, Rauthat and Sarlahi  during the first phase of the Bagmati irrigation project. Though targeted to provide irrigation facility to 30 000 ha (16,000 ha in Rauthat and 14,000 ha in Sarlahi) of land during the first stage, the target remains unfulfilled due to the incomplete gate construction work. As construction work of the branch canal in the western main canal system and the installation of gates have not been completed, these works will be completed in the second year of u the plan. There is also a target to create the infrastructure to provide irrigation facility to an additional 6,000 ha. of land from the western ma in canal system. Thus, the gross target to provide irrigation facility from the western and eastern main canal systems is 36,000 ha by the third year of the plan with 22,000 ha and 14,000 ha respectively from the western and eastern main canal systems. Narayani Irrigation Project (Third Phase): Irrigation facility will be made available in a more reliable way after undertaking construction and management service works to be decided following the review of this project. Marchawar Lift Irrigation Project (Second Phase): From this project, 5,600 ha of land falling in Rupandehi district is targeted to be irrigated by pumping water from the Tinao river. Irrigation facility was provided to 2,000 ha of land with the completion of the pump house, the main canal transmission line and 22 km feeder road under the first phase work. Under the second phase, irrigation facility will be provided to 3,600 ha of land by developing the command area and extending the canal system. Bhairahawa Lumbini Groundwater Project (Third Phase): Additional 8,200 ha of Rupandehi and Nawalparasi land is targeted to be irrigated from the groundwater under this project. During the Plan period, however, Irrigation facility will be provided to an additional 4,000 ha of land from this project. Babai Irrigation Project (First Phase): Construction of weir cum bridge in the Babai River has been started with His Majesty\\'s Government\\'s own resources under the first phase of this project. Weir cum bridge, main canal, branch canals and other structures will be completed within the plan period to irrigate all 13,200 ha of land as targeted. Mahakali Irrigation Project (Second Phase): The second phase works have already been initiated as 4,600 ha of land is already being irrigated from 13 cumecs  of water made available under the Nepal-India Agreement. An additional 6,800 ha of land can be irrigated from the available water. The works under the second phase is targeted to be completed the third year of the plan. Sufficient agricultural intensification is expected with the access to systematic irrigation facility to 11,400 ha of land in the district of Kanchanpur after the full development of this project. Sector Programme (Eastern and Central): This programme has been initiated with a view to develop irrigation as sectoral programme by bringing about changes in the donor traditions of making the assistance available only after a detailed prior study of the specific sub-projects. According to this programme, irrigation facility will be developed in 17,000 ha and 8,000 ha of land respectively from renovation of farmers\\' canal and new projects in the thirty five districts of the Eastern and Central Development Regions. Project implementation capability will be enhanced by strengthening the District Irrigation Offices in all 22 districts. Altogether 11,200 ha and 9,800 ha of land in the eastern and central development regions respectively will receive irrigation facility during the plan period. Irrigation Line of Credit and Major Extensive Irrigation Sector Project (Western, Midwestern and Farwestern Development Regions): The project was launched in the form of a pilot project with a view to provide surface and groundwater irrigation without prior specification of the sub-projects in seven districts of the Western Development Region – Gorkha, Lamjung, Tanahu, Kaski, Syangja Nawalparasi Kapilbastu (underground and surface) and two district of the Mid - western Development Region. - Banke and Dang Groundwater irrigation). The project is in the verge of expansion as a pilot programme in other districts of the Western, Midwest-n and Far Western Development Regions. Project works under ILC, implemented in the form of a pilot programme, are targeted to be completed by FY 1993/94. Upon completion of this pilot phase, this programme will be continued the form of a extensive sector irrigation programme. Und the extensive sector irrigation programme included in the current plan, feasible surface and groundwater irrigation projects in the ILC district and groundwater projects in the eastern and central terai districts will be implemented. 1,000 ha respectively in the Western, Midwestern, Far-western, Central and Eastern, Development Regions) from groundwater sources during the Plan period. Rasuwa Nuwakot Integrated Rural Development Project (Irrigation Programme): This, programme was launched in order to Provide irrigation facility to 2,400 ha of land by implementing small and medium irrigation schemes in Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. Additional irrigation facility will be made available to 2,000 ha of land during the Plan period.

This project is to be reappraised by the International Fund for Agriculture Development in FY 1992/93. Following this, it is targeted to provide groundwater irrigation facility to 1,000 ha of land by initiating the project during this plan period. Eastern Terai (Morang) Irrigation Project: The feasibility study of this project was completed with a view to provide irrigation facility to 7,000. ha of land with the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water from Bakraha, Maria, Bara, Keraka and Dans rivers. Implementation of the project will be initiated during this plan period to provide irrigation facility to 750 ha of land by up-dating the feasibility study. Rajapur Irrigation Project: Irrigation facility in one or the other form is currently available to about 1 5 00 0 he of land from 22 canals originating from Geruwa and Karnali rivers in a place called Rajapur Tappu in Bardia district. This project is aimed  to be developed in the form of river control and farmers\\' canals renovation project, as the onslaught of the excessive flood in the Karnali every year cause s great harm to all t e 22 canals and the entire command area of Rajapur Tappu. Rani, Jamara and Kulaharia Canals: The farmers have, in their own traditional ways, irrigated some areas in the district of Kailali from Rani, Jamara and Kulharia canals by channeling water from the Karnali river. It is aimed at providing irrigation facility to 7,000 ha of land by systematising the operation of the above canal system during this plan period. Eastern Rapti Irrigation Project: Under the revised programme irrigation facility will be provided to 4,242 ha of land during the plan period against the proposed plan of providing irrigation to 1,800 ha by 900 tubewells and to 71000 ha by improving 84 farmers’ canals. Trishuli Irrigation Project: Irrigation service has been provided to only 20-30 ha of land from the Battar lift irrigation project as against the target of 424 ha due to the scarcity of spare parts. The construction work will be completed during the plan period upon the completion of the feasibility study to provide irrigation facility to 1,200 ha of land belonging to Bidur and Battar from the power channel of the Trishuli hydro -electric project, without affecting the latter. Bheri-Babai Diversion Project: Therefore, the feasibility study will be carried out during the plan period and appropriate steps will be taken to advance the project to the implementation level based on the study. Upper Mahakali: This will provide irrigation facility to the land north of the existing Mahakali irrigation project from the water to be received by Nepal for irrigation from the Tanakpur barrage across the Mahakali River. Lumbini Integrated Irrigation Project (Rajkudwa irrigation Project): Rajkudwa irrigation project planned with the objective of drawing canals from the dams built across Kondre and Rajkudwa rivers in the district of Kapilvastu in the Western Development Region and collecting water even for the winter crop by refurbishing an increasing the capacity of other ponds existing in that region including those of Gorusingye and Rajpur is expected to provide reliable irrigation to 5,000 ha of land lying between Dhekarma and Belwa Gurubda rivers. It is estimated to provide reliable irrigation facility to about 2,400 ha of land during the plan period. This project is estimated to provide irrigation to 1,600 ha of land upon the initiation of second phase programme in Ilam, Taple jung and Panchthar districts. Bahundanda/Phalkapur Irrigation Projects: These projects belong to the district of Dang of the Rapti zone. Irrigation facility will be available to 800 ha. of land of that district from this programme. Feasibility study of this project between completed. It is planned to provide irrigation facility as per target upon completion of its construction work during the plan period. Small irrigation Projects to be Operated by Agricultural Development Bank: In view of the fact that it has been implementing small irrigation projects in an effective manner, the Agriculture Development Bank is expected to provide irrigation facility to a total of 119,700 ha of land by means of tubewell, surface irrigation, the sprinkler system etc. during this plan period. Irrigation Programs to be implemented by Non-governmental Organization and the Private Sector: The Non-governmental organisation and private sector will be involved in the task of providing the access to irrigation facility to the economically deprived backward communities living in remote areas as these people cannot even contact government agencies or Agriculture Development Bank for the said purpose. Irrigation facility will be provided with the application of technology involving sprinkler, drip, linnares pump etc. in view of the land feature and geological condition. Efficiency of 1250 number of shallow tubewells from among those installed in the Terai will be increased with electrification. Irrigation will also be provided in the hilly areas by means of water harvesting. Lower HP pumps will be made available to provide irrigation facilities in areas having access to electricity. In t his way, irrigation facility will be made available to about 13,063 ha of land by utilizing different mechanisms. Other Programmes: Operation, Repair and Maintenance Operation, repair and maintenance of different irrigation projects of the kingdom not turned over to the farmer\\'s groups will be continued. It is necessary to undertake repair, maintenance and improvement of completed projects every year in order not to reduce the usefulness of such projects. Irrigation Management, Project Turn over, Trainingand Research: The Department of Irrigation has been conducting training programmes on irrigation with foreign assistance for some years in the past. This training centre will be gradually developed into an institution to impart national level training on the subjects of irrigation development management. Extensive improvement will be effected in the irrigation management system by enhancing the capability of government agencies as well as water users\\' association through the programmes of this institution. The responsibility of organising all trainings under the irrigation sector will be entrusted to this institution. There is also a program to continue other applied research and studies in order to improve the implementation of training and irrigation systems. The programme of gradually turning over full responsibility of completed small and medium irrigation projects (2  ,000 ha in Terai and 500 ha in hill) at the government level to the farmers users\\' committee after undertaking necessary improvement works will be pursued. Besides, it is planned to make irrigation participation and management aspects more organised and effective by involving local users\\' group in the operation, repair and maintenance of large and medium projects. Groundwater Investigation Project: There is a need to construct and develop groundwater irrigation projects, after undertaking investigation and feasibility study on priority basis, in areas where surface irrigation is not feasible. In addition, a strategy will be formulated and a master plan prepared for the development of groundwater with the study of different alternatives for groundwater irrigation development. River Control Project: River control works will be continued as a regular programme in order to check the damage to land and settlements and the erosion of cultivable land resulting from the eroding river banks following floods in the river. River control works will be carried out at inevitable places by encouraging local people’s participation. A Master Plan of one or two major rivers will be prepared in every region under river control programme and the control work will be carried out in a systematic manner. Under this, river control works of Rangeli and Sunsari will also be implemented. Water Induced Hazard Control: Support will be provided to water induced hazard control works by organising relevant training programmes and collecting the data relating to water induced hazard control. Besides, construction of the hydraulic laboratory, installation of equipment and various training programmes will be undertaken. Implementation Procedure: ILC/18P Requisition for a new project may be placed with the district irrigation office by the users’ committee. Information will be made available to the farmers by the District Irrigation Office regarding the policy related to the project implementation, type and extent of people’s participation, repair and maintenance, supervision of the construction works etc. The District Irrigation Office will forward the survey, design and estimate to the Regional Appraisal Committee (RAC) for approval. The selection of such projects will be done by RAC on a priority basis. The users’ committee to be constituted by the farmers will be registered as per prevailing law on approval of the project by RAC. An agreement between DID and the users\\' committee will be signed incorporating the basis for cost sharing, guarantee of people\\'s participation, repair and maintenance and supervision of construction work etc. A part of the amount in cash to be borne by the users\\' committee will be deposited in the nearest bank either from its own resources or With the assistance of the bank. The bank account will be operated with the joint signatures of the representative of the DIO and the representative of the users\\' committee. Small, medium and large irrigation projects will be implemented under I LC/ISP Agriculture Development Bank: Requisition from a group or individual for any small irrigation project may be made with the nearest office of the Agriculture Development Bank. There is an arrangement to provide information to the farmers about the detailed survey, design and estimate by the bank upon the receipt of the project request. When it is decided to implement the project, a users\\' committee will be constituted from among the farmers. An agreement will be reached between the bank and the users committee regarding the cost estimate of the project, cost sharing formula, people’s voluntary labour, repair and maintenance etc. The amount to be made available by His Majesty\\'s Government and the amount to be borne by the users’ committee in the total estimate will be deposited in the bank The amount required for the construction of the project is to be spent with the joint signatures of t e representative of users\\' committee and the representative of the bank. Under this programme, projects of up to 500 ha are being implemented. The project is handed over to the users\\' committee upon its completion. In the case of a personal project, the farmers may request the bank to finance the irrigation modes of their choice. Agricultural Development Bank will make arrangements to provide the grant amount obtained from His Majesty\\'s Government including loan, if the farmer\\'s project is found feasible. There is a provision for certification by the bank technician as to whether the project is completed or not. Project Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements: 1. A high level committee will he constituted under the chairmanship of the Honourabl Minister for Water Resources in order to co-ordinate agencies engaged in planning, monitoring and implementing national programmes for the development and expansion of irrigation. 2. The arrangement of programmei e implemented by the non-governmental organisation and the private sectors along with the management of financial resources will be undertaken by the aforementioned committee. 3. Emphasis will be given on systematic monitoring arrangements in order to bring about effectiveness in the implementation of different projects during the plan period. All implementing agencies will have to send mandatory progress reports in every phase to the concerned ministries. Details of Expenditure: Estimated cost to undertake the above programme is Rs8,932.6 million for irrigating 161,132 hectares of land from different irrigation projects to be implemented by His Majesty’s Government and other complementary programmes. His Majesty’s Government will make available Rs 746.3 million to small irrigation programmes to be implemented through the Agriculture Development Bank in order to provide irrigation facility to 119,700 hectares of land. It is estimated that Rs 620.9 million will be borne by HMG towards providing irrigation facility to 13,063 hectares of land from the programmes to be implemented by non-governmental organizations and the private sector. This also includes the programme for electrification of 1,250 tubewells. In order to achieve the aforementioned target, management cost worth Rs 893.3 million, 150 million and 155.2 million for the projects to be implemented by the government, Agriculture Development Bank, and Non- government Organisation/Private Sector respectively and contingency expenses worth Rs 467.7 million amounting to a total or Rs 1,666.2 million is estimated to be incurred. A total of Rs 11,966 million is estimated to be spent to meet the expenses of projects under construction, new projects to be implemented and other complementary programmes during the Eighth Plan. For this purpose a sum of Rs 4,801 million will be borne by HMG and 7,165 million from external assistance. People’s participation worth Rs 1,028.6 million will also be mobilized in the programme. Details of Manpower: The people\\'s participation will play a key role in the Eighth Plan period and the irrigation sector will be gradually oriented towards autonomous entrepreneurship. In keeping with the policy of the projects constructed by the government to be gradually operated under joint management or turned over-to the us ers\\' group arrangements will be made for the requisite manpower by effecting timely changes in the government agencies in order to operate locally self reliant irrigation programmes. Energy Introduction: The prosperity of any country can be gauged by the per capita energy consumption of that country as a direct positive relation is noticed between the two. Although per capita consumption of energy in Nepal is extremely low compared to other countries, the annual import bill of petroleum products, comprising only four percent of the energy consumption, claims as high as 40 percent of annual earnings from export. Solar energy is without doubt the main source of energy of the lithospher e, but the process of converting the solar energy into electricity and other kinds of energy in order to meet the need of modern industry, transport, household and others in general, has been found to be very costly. Therefore, the desperate current need is to meet the constantly increasing energy requirement through the proper development and mobilization of main energy resources like forest, bio -mass and hydropower existing in the country. The energy sector program in the Eighth Plan has fully considered these realities. Progress during the Seventh Plan Period and the Period without Plan: The progress in the electricity sector and alternative sources of energy during the Seventh Plan (1985-1990) and the interim period (1991-1992) was as follows: 7,544 In addition to the progress shown above, preliminary studies relating to feasibility and detailed engineering designs of Upper Karnali (240 MW), Upper Arun (350 MW), Bhote Kosi (48 MW) and Khimti Khola (60 MW) projects which can be implemented for future internal consumption and exports have been completed. Feasibility studies of Arun-III, Upper Arun and West Seti hydro-elertric projects, have also been completed and represent economically attractive propositions. Also completed is the study of a prospective project of 10 MW capacity in the Jhimruk river for supplying electricity to the headquarters of some hill districts (Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Pyuthan, Rolpa etc.) of the Western and Midwestern Development Regions. The detailed engineering study of the Arun_III hydro-electric project (402 MW) was already completed the in order to initiate construction for meeting the projected demand to be met from the central grid. Regarding major hydroelectric projects with export potential, studies relating to detailed project preparation of the Karnali (Chisapani) high dam multipurpose project and necessary field survey works in order to carry out the feasibility study of the Mahakali (Pancheswar) multipurpose project in the international border have been completed. Talks between officials of India and Nepal at various levels are in progress in order to implement these projects. Works relating to increasing the capacity particularly of the existing Trishuli-Devighat hydropower stations from among the existing generating stations will be undertaken. Existing Problems: Commercial and traditional fuels have remained as two principal sources of national energy supply. Hydropower in particular will be developed as a new commercial energy base for the country’s economic growth. It is essential to pay special attention to the scientific management of the traditional energy sources in order to ensure its sustained use and also to maintain the environmental balance. Traditional Energy: 1. Excessive Reliance on Timber and Fuelwood: It is evident that a sustainable supply of fuelwood can not be maintained from uncontrolled clearance of forests. If this process of forest destruction is to continue, there will be a scarcity of fuelwood in the country in the very near future and additional environmental probkems of different sorts will also emerge. Such a situation has arisen due to the failure to take effective steps towards scientific forest management. Another principal reason for forest denudation is associated with the ownership of the forest. The legal ownership and control of forest resources of the kingdom is vested exclusively with His Majesty’s Government. In the context of the absence of any alternative to immediate and proper substitution for fuelwood, the transfer of forest ownership to the private and community sectors has remained the sole alternative for safeguarding the forest resources and meeting the fuelwood nee. 2. Substitution of Fuelwood by other Traditional Fuels: The use of other fuels has been steadily increasing due to the short supply of fuelwood. In the rural areas, an increased substitution of fuelwood by agricultural residues and cattle wastes has taken place. This has adversely affected fertility of the cultivated land due to deficiency in organic manure. In the urban areas, the rich community has started using the imported commercial fuels in place of fuelwood. The proportion of population using electricity as fuel is, however, still very small. Similarly, industries have started using agricultural residues and kerosene due to high price of fuelwood. Commercial Fuel: 1. Electricity: It is evident from the table in Appendix 2 that the gap between electricity demand and supply will continue to be wodened in the coming years. Electricity supply compared to demand will be less from the coming Fiscal Year (1993/94). A monthly deficit has occurred even prior to this period. In the coming couple of years, additional electricity demand by new industries is estimated to be 50 MW. The deficit is expected to continue until the Kaligandaki (1998/99) project commences power generation in FY 1998/99 followed by Arun-III in FY 2001/02 as targeted. The principal problem in the energy sector is thus the imbalance between electricity demand and supply. There are, however, other operating constraints as listed below; 1. At present electrical energy is being made available at rates lesser than its actual cost. This has made it difficult to attract the investment of the private sector in electricity generation. 2. The percentage of leakage is very high in the electric network due to technical and hosts of other reasons. This seems to be less than the expected level. The possibility of increasing the existing load factor through proper demand management is indicated. 5. It has not been possible to receive proper return out of the investment because of the imbalance between the investment on power generation and the creation of transmission network. 6. Analyzed from the point of number of employees in the power sector, power generation and annual sale per employee in Nepal seems to be the least of all countries in Asia. 7. It has not been possible to plan hydro-electric projects in a proper manner due to the lack of co-ordination among the agencies involved in the power sector. 8. There does not seem to have been an appropriate selection of hydro-electric projects in a systematic way due to ineffective reviewing technique applied to studies relating to hydro-electric projects and an inefficient selection process. This has resulted in the lack of sufficient alternatives for implementation of the project. 9. It has not been possible to maintain continuity in the development of hydropower sector because of the inability to appoint concerned agencies themselves as the executing agency and make the Nepali technical agencies responsible and accountable for the project while conducting the study and mplementing the hydro-electric projects. Imported Fuel: It has already been mentioned that the requirement of commercial fuel such as mineral oils and coal is being met through import. The import of mineral oils and coal comprised 85% of the commercial fuel consumption in FY 1990/91. Forty percent of the income earned through export is thus spent on the import of petroleum fuel. Inadequacy of Appropriate Programmes Relating to Alternative Energy: It has not been possible to promote alternative energy sources like biogas, micro hydro, improved stove, solar water heater etc. at the desired level. Government policies in this regard were not reliable in the past. Though these technologies were publicized at the peoples’ level, they could not be brought into adequate practical use. Constraints relating to Investment: As regards investment, the power sector has been receiving the highest priority followed by the forestry sector. But the level of investment in the development of natural gas and alternative energy seems to be insignificant. Also, the investment in forest, in reality, is not even sufficient for the supply of fuelwood. An analysis of the expenditure statistics of the past decade reveals that the expenditure incurred in the power sector ranged from 63.2 percent to 87.5 percent of the expenditure incurred in the development of the entire energy sector. The investment level in the power sector is expected to stay at the same level in the coming years as well. It could have been possible to maintain the growth rate of the power sector at a higher level by mobilising economies of scale inherent in the larger projects. This, however, entails a very high investment beyond the capacity of the present economy. Implementation of large projects to date has been done with the mobilisation of the international consortium financing. Under this arrangement, there is a possibility of diseconomies of scale due to increased cost of the project because of the tied financing. It is very difficult to obtain the entire investment requirement from a single donor institution in the development of large hydro-electric project as it requires heavy foreign investment. It has not been possible to generate electricity at stipulated time and cost due to delay in the implementation of the project resulting from the lack of synchronized financing by multiple donors. Energy plays a key role in sustainable economic growth. But national economic growth rate, availability of foreign investment, national investment capacity, demand and capacity of consumers to pay service charges have greatly influenced the decision on the fixation of priorities and investment levels towards energy demand and supply management. There is a big gap between the energy demand and its sustainable supply. Hydropower itself comes in the forefront among different sources of energy available in Nepal. But initial investment requirements are quite heavy in hydropower generation and distribution projects. A review of energy use pattern in the past shows that the traditional means of energy such as wood, fuelwood, shows that the traditional means of energy such as wood, fuelwood, cowdung cakes, agricultural residues have occupied an important place in the supply of national energy. While traditional energy has contributed 95% in the total energy consumption of the country, the contribution of hydropower is below 1%. According to recent statistics, only 9% of the total population has access to electricity. The main objective of the Eighth Plan is to provide economic justice to the backward community by increasing the national production. In order to achieve this, it is essential to encourage the private sector in the promotion and diversification of agricultural and industrial production including improvement and expansion of the existing service sector. In fact, it will not be an exaggeration to say that dynamism and diversification in agricultural and industrial sectors is possible only with the availability and effective use of energy at reasonable cost. The role of energy in our economy is important both from the standpoint of domestic use and export. The pace of industrialisation was sluggish in the past due to the shortage of energy despite sufficient bio and water energy resources in the country. The pace of industrial development can not be accelerated until the obstacle of the availability of energy is removed. Besides, hindrances may be faced in the growth in agricultural production due to shortage of energy in activities such as processing of agricultural produce and lift irrigation. Enough support will also be provided in the development of food processing and cottage industry if water mills, diesel engine and biogas including micro hydro-power project can be promoted for meeting energy needs in the rural areas. Sufficient benefit can be derived from the implementation of comparatively cheaper major hydro-electric projects of Nepal. National production and productivity can be increased and foreign exchange can also be earned by exporting electricity, if effective hydropower projects and other sources of energy are developed and consolidated in a cost-effective manner. In addition to this, the amount of foreign currency being spent in the import of mineral oils, which can be substituted by national energy, can be reduced. All these facts tend to indicate that high priority has to be accorded to the development of energy. Human resources and financial investment in large measure are necessary to meet the ever increasing demand for energy by developing the energy resources available in the country. Programmes and strategies relating to energy have, therefore, been formulated so that they meet the national energy needs. Due consideration has been given to the present economic status of the country, the available technology and the national priority, too. More than 70% of the total investment has been made for the development of different sectors of the economy from the government sector itself in the past. But it has become essential for the benefit of the economy to abandon the tradition of only the government sector making such investment. It is necessary to provide proper incentives to attract the investment of the private sector in the development of energy sector for increasing the national production capacity and mobilising the government resources as much as possible towards rural development. Energy Demand Supply Balance: Sector wise Energy Demand Status: Total energy use by all sectors of the economy in FY 1990/91 was 268,700,000 GJ (Giga Joules), of which 93 percent was used by the domestic sector. Of which 93 percent was used by the domestic sector. Of the remaining energy, the industrial sector used 4 percent and transport, trade and other sectors used 3 percent. Ninety-eight percent of the energy requirement of the domestic sector is being met by the, traditional energy sources. Although the comp onent of the commercial energy is very low in the national energy consumption, 28 percent of the total commercial energy is used by the domestic sector alone. The commercial energy consumption has increased at the rate of 10 percent per annum within the decade beginning FY 1980/81. Sixty- six percent of the total requirement of the industrial sector is being met from the traditional energy and 8 percent from electricity. Demand of electrical energy has been increasing at an average rate of 15 percent per annum over the past decade. The transport sector is mainly dependent upon petroleum fuels. Similarly, 70 percent of the total energy requirement of the trade sector is bein g met from the commercial fuel itself. Contribution of electric energy to this sector has been 21 percent. In the same way, about 95 percent of the commercial fuel requirement of the agricultural sector is being met from petroleum fuels and the rest from electric energy. The annual rate of increase in consumption of the commercial fuel in the agricultural sector during the past decade has been limited to 8 percent. It is evident that further intense growth is expected to take place in the consumption of commercial fuel in the coming years due to the diversification in the production of agriculture sector, development of tourist industry, expansion of industrialisation etc. Because of the fact that the people in the rural areas have been receiving the traditional energy free of cost, it is but natural that the demand for such energy will be increasing in future. Due to this, the environmental problem will still be grave because of accelerated forest clearance. Present Energy supply status: 1. Electric Energy: The installed hydropower generation capacity in the country has reached around 233 MW. This is less than\\'0.3 percent of the total theoretical potential. At present Jhimrik hydroelectric project of Pyuthan with an installed capacity of 12 MW is under construction. The total installed capacity from thermal sources is 55 MW. The generating capacity of small hydro and diesel power stations in the remote areas is 16 MW. Additional 4.2 MW of hydropower has been made available from mid 1991 from the small hydro-electric projects with the generating capacity of 32.to 245 Kw. An additional 2000 KW will be available from the three small hydroelectric projects now under construction. The peak load of the nation had reached 190 MW in 1991/92. The construction of Marsyangdi Hydro-electric Project (69 MW), Andhi Khola Hydro-electric Project (5.1 MW) and Small Hydroelectric Projects (1.59 MW) was completed during the interim years (1990-1992). Besides, the construction of 197 km transmissi9n line has also been completed. In addition to the aforementioned physical target, several studies have been completed including feasibility and detailed - engineering studies of projects that can be implemented for future internal consumption and export. A brief description of the projects whose studies have been undertaken at various levels 15 given in Appendix 1. Regarding major hydro-electric projects with export potential, studies relating to project preparation of the Karnali Chisapani) high dam multipurpose project and necessary works relating to site investigation in order to carry out the feasibility study of the Mahakali (Pancheswor) multipurpose project in the international border have been completed. Talks among officials at different levels of India and Nepal have continued in order to implement these projects. Micro hydroelectric projects have also been constructed in the private sector. Total generation capacity of micro hydropower stations operated .in the private sector is estimated at 920 KW. 2. Fuelwood: Most of the rural households are meeting their energy needs from fuelwood available in the nearby forest free of cost. The urban households, on the other hand, meet part of their energy needs by buying fuelwood. This amounts to less than 10% of the total national requirement. In rural market centres of the hilly region, fuelwood is purchased by tea shops, restaurants and government employees while others meet their needs by collecting fuelwood from the forest. The private traders sell fuelwood through depots and dealership in the urban areas and the Timber Corporation of Nepal (TCN) also sells a small portion of the total fuelwood transaction. Forest denudation is estimated to have taken place at the rate of 2.1 percent per annum or 27,000 ha per year during the period beginning FY 1964/65 to FY 1978/79. The total forest area lost by the country duri ng this period is estimated at 382,000 ha. The total national yearly consumption of fuelwood is 11.7 million mt and the supply of fuelwood in the regions of midhills and the eastern Terai has started to dwindle. The problem has not yet seriously manifested in the Midwestern and Farwestern regions. The professional woodcutters and the hill descendants are particularly found to be involved in the sale of fuelwood by illegal felling of .trees. Besides, a lot of wood/fuelwoodis found traded by the households settled near the highways by collecting from the forest in the pretention of their domestic use. In fact, this type of unauthorised cutting and selling has become off-farm employment to most villagers. 3. Other Forms of Bioenergy: Agricultural residue and cattle waste predominate in other forms of bioenergy. The quantity of agricultural waste used in the form of fuel is estimated to be around 600,000 metric tons with straw content at 50%. Besides, fuel requirement is being met from about 2.3 million mt of cow dung cakes. 4. Commercial Fuel: In commercial fuel, mineral oil or petroleum products and anthracite coal are in most use. Almost the entire demand of these products is met through import. The share of petroleum products in the national energy consumption is 4 percent and its share in the total commercial fuel is 72 percent. Nepal oil Corporation has the monopoly to sell and distribute petroleum products within the country. It purchases kerosene and diesel from the world market and has arranged to receive (motor spirit is commercially known as petroleum or gasoline) aviation fuel, LPG including different oil products in exchange by making the imported crude oil available to India. This corporation has arranged to sell and distribute these products as necessary upon storing them in the stores of Kathmandu, Amlekhganj, Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, Nepalganj and Dhangadhi. Supply Arrangement of Coal: The national requirement of coal is being met through the import due to virtual non -existence of coal mines in Nepal. This responsibility has been entrusted to the Nepal Coal Mines Limited. Depot off ices of this corporation have been set uP in Birgunj, .Biratnagar and Bhairahawa in order to store, sell and distribute coal in important places of the kingdom. 5. Power Exchange Arrangement: Power exchange has been limited to 20 MW due to insufficient existing interconnection network, though there is a provision to exchange power up to 50 MW with India under the existing power exchange arrangement between the two countries. While Nepal has received electricity from India at some places near the Nepal-India border, Nepal also has made available electricity to India at some other places. The country is in a favourable position to develop major multipurpose water resource projects for export. In this connection, talks are being held to develop some bilateral and multilateral major water resource projects of multipurpose nature. The composition of the energy source of Nepal is based on the admixture of traditional and commercial fuels (forest products, agricultural residue, cowdung, solar and electric power). The country has the capacity to continuously produce the energy equivalent to 1,860 million Giga Joules (GJ) annually. This figure is 50 times higher than the existing estimate of energy consumption. The country can be self reliant in the energy sector provided the existing energy resources are properly utilized. It will not be an exaggeration to say that hydropower occupies a special position as 79 percent of the energy supply can be made available from this source. 1. Hydropower: It is estimated that Nepal has a theoretical hydropower potential of 83,000 MW on the basis of the analysis of river flows. Of this, about 42,000 MW can be generated on the basis of economic feasibility studies carried out to date. Studies have proven the existence of sufficient opportunities to develop multipurpose water resource projects with the construction of high dams due to its hill topography. On the basis of studies carried out to date, the hydro-electric projects exceeding 10 MW are 93 in number. In 30 of these projects, there is a possibility of constructing high dam. 2. Fuelwood: It is estimated that about 8.85 million ha of land in Nepal can be developed into productive forests. At present, 6.73 million ha of the country\\'s land is estimated to be covered by forest and shrubs. Fuelwood is being collected from 50 percent or 3.34 million ha of the area covered by forest and bushes. It is estimated that 5.7 million mt of fuelwood per year can be met in a sustainable manner from this forest area. Objective: 1. To integrate the national, productive sector as much as possible with the internally available energy and make the count ry more self-reliant by reducing the production cost of energy. 2. To gradually replace the imported energy with them obilisation of local source by especially emphasising on the proper development of different sources of energy available in the country. 3. To develop and utilise energy in such a way that it does not adversely affect the environment. National Energy strategy: Works will be undertaken for the promotion of technology for increased efficiency in scientific management and energy consumption from forest and other big significant sources at the community level with the objective of meeting the traditional demand and supply of energy. It is necessary for this work to be done through the forest users group. Regarding the commercial fuel, appropriate policy measures will be taken for the creation of environment conducive to gradually proceed towards self-reliance and conservation of energy. Special priority will be given to the substitution of imported energy by locally, available energy sources in order to solve the problem of balance of payment. The hydropower programmes will be tied up with irrigation, road and energy intensive industrial programmes requiring cheap energy. It is essential to mobilise investment from within the power sector in order to provide continuity to the development of the power sector. For this purpose, such projects will be selected which are capable of generating maximum profit and mobilising the possible savings. Keeping the aforementioned facts in view, following strategies will be pursued during the Eighth Plan: 1. Suitable steps will be taken to develop local energy sources in order to bring about sustainability in the national energy consumption keeping in view the technical and economic feasibility. 2. Management of energy consumption of the economically active productive sector and various other means of energy conservation will be adopted with proper study of the sensitivity of the environmental aspects as well. 3. Necessary arrangements will be made to involve bot h the government and non-government sectors for investment in large, medium and small power projects. Besides, diverse commercial and financial sources will be mobilised. 4. Shortfall in the supply of energy in the short term and long term will be fulfilled from import only in case it can not be met domestically. Agreements relating to the power exchange will be entered into in the best interest of the country with a view to achieving maximum benefit. 5. Social norms and values will be kept in mind while fi xing the price of all types of fuels in all cases except in those where the objective of the national development policy may be adversely affected. 6. Concerned agencies will be activated to control environmental problems related to energy supply and use. A balance will be struck in the development of energy, and conservation and promotion of environment. 7. The possibility of transferring the ownership of government institutions involved in power distribution and generation to the private sector will be looked into in consonance with the privatisation policy. Necessary support will be provided to RECAST, Engineering Institute, Biogas Company and similar other industries in generating1 energy, manufacturing utility equipment and undertaking research for the development of appropriate and safe energy technology at minimum cost statistics and information related to energy at the government level will be brought to the notice of general public through educational institutions, mass communication and special programmes, like site exhibition. Energy policy: An energy Master Plan will be formulated by determining long term policies and identifying appropriate institutional structure necessary for managing the demand and supply in the energy sector. The Master Plan will pay particular attention to identifying ways of institutional change especially in the power sector because of the necessity to accord top priority to the study of institutional reforms within the field of commercial fuels. The energy policy during the Eighth Plan will be 9s follows: 1. The Perspective Energy Plan will be used especially in the hydropower sector in order to know hydropower project of different capacities so that an adequate number of projects of various capacities are available for financing feasibility studies. 2. An export oriented strategy will be adopted with regard to power generation from large hydropower projects. This will earn foreign currency needed for development. Maximum bilateral and multilateral cooperation will be mobilised for developing such projects. 3. The development of medium hydropower projects will be promoted by integrating it with the development of energy-intensive industries having comparative advantages. 4. External, internal and joint collaboration with the private sector will be promoted in the development and financing of medium and small scale hydropower projects. Besides, legal and institutional arrangements providing support to exchange and pricing of power will be formulated and implemented. 5. The hydropower sector will be integrated with the irrigation programme. Similarly, industries operating during off-peak hours will be provided electricity at concessional rates. 6. Programmes relating to growth of forest resource products will be implemented throu gh the users group in order to maintain continuity in the supply of traditional energy. 7. The management of energy demand regularises the energy need of the urban areas. Price fixation of different sources of energy should reflect the social investment. Therefore} the household will be motivated to pursue energy efficient ways and devices. Appropriate and complementary import policies will be formulated for supplying energy necessary for transport equipment and machineries. 8. Requirement of fuelwood and petroleum products of the industrial, commercial and transport sectors will be gradually replaced by electricity generated locally. It will be encouraged to replace the imported fuel by electricity to a practicable extent. 9. Promotion of renewable energy technologies will be encouraged in order to reduce the current dependence on traditional and imported fuels. The private sector will be encourage d to work towards techno bogy transfer, adoptive research and development, indigenisation of hydropower biomass and other renewable energy sectors. Energy demand in the rural areas will be met in a decentralised manner through locally developed technology rand devices (cross flow turbines, induction generators and gasifiers). 11. The use of vehicles consuming more fuel will be discouraged by providing incentives for operating public transport vehicles capable of carrying, a large number of passengers. Consumption of imported fuel will be reduced by cutting down the number of government vehicles and disc9uraging liberal import of vehicles. 12. Some joint venture and technology promotion institutions will be set up with a view to providing support to manufacture energy related equipment. Arrangements will be made for providing the judicial and legal  services, defining royalty and patent services procedures, etc. for these institutions. Hydropower Policy: 1. Hydroelectric, projects will be formulated on the - basis of demand and priority will be given to the implementation of projects with less per unit production cost and capable of generating comparatively higher economic returns. 1.1 \\tHydroelectric projects of different levels and capacities will be implemented to meet the medium and long-term need for electricity. 1.2 \\tEmphasis will be given to rural electrification programme in order to provide support to the development of cottage and small industries and agricultural production in the hill and Terai regions. 1.3 \\tEmphasis will be given to the development of electrically operated transport system for gradual substitution of petroleum products. 1.4 \\tIndigenous labour, skill and resource as well as foreign investment and technology will be utilised in the development of hydropower. 1.5 \\tHydropower generated in excess of\\' thenational demand will be exported. 1.6 \\tUse of electricity will be extended in order to provide support to the conservation of forest and environment by reducing the Consumption of fuelwood. 1.7 \\tUtilisation of electricity will be diversified. 1.8 \\tSupply and distribution of regularised and made reliable. 1.9 \\tMaximum control will be affected in the leakage of electricity generated. 1.10 Electricity supply will be increased to provide sufficient energy available to the people and electricity tariff rate will be made more practical. 2. Following policies have been formulated, in order to encourage the involvement of the local autonomous bodies and _he private sector (national and foreign) in electricity generation, transmission and distribution works. 2.1 \\tNo license will be required for the hydroelectric project with up to 100 KW capacities.

The duration of license will be maximum 50 years. 2.3 \\ttransfer of the_ hydro-electric projects, transmission and distribution lines under the ownership of the government to the private sector upon their, completion at the government level in order to make them more up -to-date, less expensive and more efficient. 2.4 \\tSole or joint venture of one or more private national investors may be arranged. 2.5 \\tArrangements can be \\'made- for joint venture with the government and any one or more national or foreign investors. 2.6 \\tHundred Percent investment from one or more foreign investors will be permitted. 2.7 \\tJoint venture of national and foreign investors may be arranged. 2.8 \\tElectricity supply can be undertaken in any area under the local grid in isolation without connecting it to the national grid of the Nepal Electricity Authority (hereafter referred to as Authority). 2.9 \\tExcess electrical power generated after electrifying any specific area may be negotiated to be supplied to the grid of the Authority. 2.11 \\tIf electricity is being distributed in any specific area in isolation without obtaining a license and the electrical system of the NEA is extended thereto, and if the private sector desires to sell the hydroelectric plant and transmission and distribution line operated there, the NEA will make arrangements for purchasing the said hydro-electric plant and transmission, and distribution lines as mutually agreed between the NEA and the concerned private entrepreneurs. 2.12 \\tFinancial institutions will make available concessional loans if the national private sector desires to generate and distribute electricity up to 1000 KW in any rural area. 2.13 \\tPrivate entrepreneurs may negotiate to use the network of the NEA to transmit electricity generated by them. 2.14 The hydro-electric project established by the private sector will not be nationalised during the period of the validity of the license. 2.15 \\tProjects established with more than 50 percent of the total investment by the foreign company will automatically be transferred to His Majesty\\'s Government after the expiry of time prescribed in the license. No compensation will be given by the government for it. In case electricity is produced through hydro-electric plants of more than 1000 KW capacity, the producer of such electricity will pay the government a sum of Rs 100 per KW per annum and 2 percent of the average sale price per unit (KWH) as a royalty up _o the period of 15 years starting from the date of commercial production. After fifteen years, the producer will pay the government a sum of Rs 1000 per KW per annum and 10 percent of the average sale price per unit (KW) as a royalty. No royalty will be paid by the private sector, if it transmits and distributes electricity by purchasing it from the electric system of the NEA. 2.17 Income tax exemption will be given to the projects of the private sector generating and distributing electricity up to 1000 KW capacity hydro-electric project. 2.18 \\tA hydro -electric project, constructed under the investment of the private sector, producing more than 1000 KW will be granted income tax exemption for a period of fifteen years starting from the date of its commercial production. 2.19 Any private entrepreneur who constructs the electric substation and transmits and extends the distribution lines will be granted income tax exemption for a period of 10 years. 2.20 \\tIf private companies assume, on contract or purchase, the operation maintenance and management of the hydroelectric plant or transmission and distribution lines under the ownership of His Majesty\\'s Government, such companies will be granted income tax exemptiol1 for a period of 5 years. 2.21 The income tax will be less than 10 percent of the corporate income tax which the government imposes from time to time. 2.22 If the investor re-invests in the hydro-electric project in order to diversify the project or to expand its established capacity by 25 percent or more, or to modernise the technology or develop a subsidiary industry, such investor may deduct an amount of 50 percent of the new additional fixed asset from the taxable income of such hydro-electric projects. 2.23 \\tCustoms duty and sales tax will be levied at the prevailing rate on the import of construction equipment, machinery tools and their spare parts required for operation and maintenance, if they are produced and sold by the local industries. Only one percent of the customs duty will be levied on the import of goods if they are not produced in Nepal. 2.24 \\tAll facilities concerning the exchange of foreign currency will be provided to a foreign individual, firm or company who invests in the construction of the project for generating, transmitting and distributing the electricity at the private sector under the foreign investment and single door policy. 2.25 \\tIf the foreign currency is required for repayment of loan or its interest or repatriation of the investment which was invested as a loan or share capital for the hydroelectric project, His Majesty\\'s Government may make the foreign currency available to such private entrepreneur at the prevalent market exchange rate. 2.26 The private producer may fix the selling price of the electricity produced by itself from the hydroelectric project having a capacity of up to 1000 KW and operate / and distribute it accordingly. 2.27 \\tIf the electricity produced by the private sector from the hydro-electric project having a capacity of ,more than 1000 KW is distributed in an isolated, way without making any connection with the electric system of the NEA, the private producer may fix the selling price of the electricity in accordance with paragraph 2.26 above. However, the private producer, while fixing such selling price, may account that a dividend of up to 25 percent is accrued on the share capital. The selling rate of such electricity will be fixed, as agreed to by both parties, on the basis of the fixed percentage of the sunk cost or cost plus or fixed percentage of the average selling price of NEA. 2.29 While fixing the price as above, the private investor may depreciate all the investment made for the hydropower development in such a way that the total investment is realised, on an average, within a period of 25 years. 2.30 \\tA separate Electricity Tariff Commission will be constituted to fix the selling price of electricity. The selling price of electricity to be utilised in the national electric system or the system of the NEA will be determined on the recommendation of the said commission. The selling price will be fixed realistically on the basis of the cost. The weightage of the investment in foreign currency will also be taken into consideration while fixing the selling price. 2.31 \\tIf the electricity generated -in the country is to be, exported to a foreign country, it will be done in accordance with the agreement made between His Majesty\\'s Government and the exporter. While exporting electricity, an export tax as prescribed by His Majes ty\\'s Government will be levied. 2.32 \\tA Hydro-electric Development Unit will be set up in the Ministry of - Water Resources in order to promote the private sector\\'s participation in the hydro-electric projects, to make optimum utilisation of water resources, to approve projects with a capacity of more than 1000 KW, to render necessary assistance to the private sector in the operation of the project and to follow up on the aforesaid works. 2.33 If it is feasible tram the technical point of view the private sector may supply electricity produced by it to a point of the present electric system in a region and take it from another point of any electric system or may export it to a foreign country. It will be required to pay the required fee for such arrangement. 2.34 The Ministry of Water Resources will, from time to time, provide a list of economically attractive hydro-electric projects to the private sectors. 2.35 \\tHis Majesty I s Government will, on request, make available land to the private sector for the construction of the hydro-electric project on the same principles as it acquires land for institution under, the Land Acquisition Act, 2034(1977). If the land is \\towned by the government, it will be made available on lease throughout the licensed period. 2.36 The license holder will have to utilise the local labour and skill to the maximum while constructing or operating a hydroelectric project. 2.37 If the license holder is a foreigner, he will make arrangements for technology transfer to the Nepalese citiz ens in the course of performing the work. 2.38 While operating the hydro-electric project, it will be operated in such a way that the local people are also directly benefited from such projects. 2.39 The construction or operation of the hydro-electric project will be made in such a way that it would have minimum adverse effect on the environment. 2.40 Facilities to be provided to the private, national as well as foreign investors will be more in hydro-electric projects than those given to other industries. 2.41 Various acts relating to electricity, water resources, banking, foreign investment, decentralisation and local agency will be amended from time to time in the spirit of implementating the proposed policies. 2.42 \\tAppropriate changes will be made in the interrelationships of the Ministry of Water Resources, Water and Energy Commission and Nepal Electricity Authority for the effective implementation of the principle of institutional pluralisation. The composition of the Management Board will be determined in order to develop Nepal Electricity Authority as an autonomous institution. The water and Energy Commission will render assistance to the National Planning Commission in the development of energy policy. 2.43 \\tRoad and other infrastructural arrangements to the sites of the hydro-electric projects to be developed in future will be done in a planned manner through the concerned agencies. 2.44 \\tHis Majesty\\'s Government will provide necessary hydrological, geological and topographical data  as available and maps as required in order to involve the private investors in the hydro-electric projects. 2.45 \\tRural electrification programme will be implemented by supplying electricity from the central grid to the possible extent. If this is not feasible from financial point of view, it will be done through the execution of small hydro-electric projects. Priority will be given to the electrification of the district headquarters. 2.46 Necessary arrangements will be made to maintain a balance between the demand for and supply of electricity to different economic sectors. 2.47 Talks relating to different major and multipurpose water resource projects and other necessary works will be continued with a view to earning maximum foreign exchange from the export of hydro-electric power. Alternate Energy Policy: 1. Necessary measures will be taken to set up the micro hydropower stations and develop the improved watermills and turbines from the small rivulets flowing locally in the rural areas. 2. Encouragement will be provided to the development of appropriate technology and necessary investment  in the generation of mechanical and electrical power by harnessing the rivers with a view to supporting the development of the rural area by means of food processing, development of cottage industry, and rural electrification etc. The private entrepreneurs, Village and District Development Committees will all be mobilised in this work. 3. Development of necessary technical manpower and collection of basic data will be carried out for the development and promoting of biogas, solar energy and wind power. 4. The import of equipment related to the alternate energy technology and raw materials will be encouraged by providing incentives on tax, custom etc. Financial grant will be provided to the users of devices related to alternate energy, if found necessary. Besides, technical and financial support will Be extended to the non-governmental institution and private sector towards the promotion of alternative energy technologies. 5. Institutional arrangements will be made by setting up an alternate energy agency to implement and coordinate different energy related programmes. 6. With the promotion of bio-gas plants, concrete steps will be taken to extend their use in order to minimise the destruction of forest for fuelwood. Effective arrangements will be made for the extensive use of improved stoves in order to reduce consumption of fuelwood in the rural areas. The extension of solar energy based equipment such as solar cooker, solar water heater; solar dryer etc. will be emphasized. 7. The governmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector and educational institutions will be mobilised to create public awareness about the usefulness and use of alternate energy technologies. 8. The private sector will be inspired to playa significant role in the development of alternate energy. The private sector will be involved in adoptive research, technology transfer, technology development; distribution, installation and repair and maintenance. 9. A long term perspective plan will be formulated for the develop ment of alternate energy. Energy Sector Programme: Electricity: Following programmes will be implemented in order to achieve the objectives and policies stated in the Eighth Plan: a \\tElectricity Generation, strengthening and supply Arrangement The programmes pertaining to construction of new hydroelectric projects, consolidation, repair and maintenance of existing hydropower stations-and procurement of electricity as per the power exchange agreement between Nepal and India will be implemented. Construction of New Hydroelectric Projects: All construction works of the Jhimruk hydro-electric project with an installed capacity of 12.5 MW now under construction in Pyutha_ will be completed. Construction of the Kaligandaki I A I hydro-electric project with an installed capacity of 100 MW will be started in order to generate power from the Kaligandaki river in the western development region. In addition to this, works relating to the first phase of the Arun -III hydro-electric project will be initiated in order to ge nerate power from the Arun river. Generation capacity of the first phase will be 201 MW. A total of 29.7 MW of additional hydropower will be available during this, plan period with the respective contribution of 12.2 MW, 12.5 and 0.5 MW by refurbishing Trishuli-Devighat hydropower stations, completing the Jhimruk hydro-electric project and by various other small hydro-electric projects. Arrangements will be made for the projects like Khimti and Modi to be implemented by the private sector entrepreneurs during the Eighth Plan in accordance with the policy of involving the private sector in the field of hydro-electric power generation. strengthening of the Existing Hydropower stations: The existing generating capacity of the Trishuli and Devighat hydropower stations in Nuwakot district will be increased as per the policy of increasing the existing generating capacity. The generating capacity of the Trishuli and Devighat hydropcwer stations will be increased during this plan period by carrying out improvement and consolidation measures. From this, a total of 280,000 kilowatt hour of electric energy will be generated with the addition of about 95,000 kilowatt hour of electric energy to the existing 185,000 kilowatt hour of electric energy being generated annually. This will lead to an increase\\' of about 12.2 MW of power generation capacity. Alternate Energy Supply Arrangement: About 12,800 million cubic meters of natural gas is, estimated to be available within the Kathmandu valley. The natural gas is being used nowadays as domestic fuel in limited quantities. Detailed feasibility study will be undertaken about the possibility of generating power from that gas. The gas project will be implemented in the private sector if it is financially feasible. Arrangement of Power supply from India: Power exchange is currently limited to 20 MW due to insufficient interconnection network of NEA although there is provision for exchange of power up to 50 MW with India under the existing power exchange arrangement between the two countries. Therefore, with the construction of Duhabi (Nepal) - Kataiya (India) transmission line, arrangements will be made for the additional supply of power, too. In addition to this, 10 million units of electric energy will be annually available from the Tanakpur hydroelectric project of India as per the understanding reached between Nepal and India in that regard. Apart from the hydro-electric projects mentioned in Appendix 2B (Trishuli-Devighat, Jhimruk, Modi, Khimti, Kali Gandaki \\'A\\') electric load management (15 MW), the deficit in the demand/supply situation in electric energy in the coming years will be met through alternate energy arrangement (natural gas - about 10 MW) and the remaining 50 MW through import from India. Programmes for the construction, extension and improvement of the electric transmission line have been incorpora1;ed to distribute the electric power generated from different power stations in the kingdom with minimum leakage to different places and settlements as per demand. b. Towards the construction of the electric transmission line, construction of a 42 km long Duhabi-Kataiya 132 KV transmission line will be completed. Similarly, construction of .200 km long 132 KV transmission line between Banke (Kohalpur) and Kanchanpur (Mahendranagar) of the remaining portion of the central grid is now under construction while 105 km long Atariya-Dadeldhura-Dipayal 66 KV transmission line and various 100 km long 33 KV sub-grid lines will also be completed within the plan period. Biratnagar, Kathmandu valley and Hetauda- Bharatpur, Birganj and Butwal-Bharatpur sections will be strengthened. The present capacity of the grid substations of the high voltage transmission lines will be increased as per the, projected demand. Interconnection of the transmission lines will be effected in order to efficiently operate the existing power exchange programme with India. c. \\tstrengthening of the Distribution system As regards the strengthenin g of the distribution system, consolidation works of the distribution at Biratnagar, Janakpur, Pokhara and Nepalganj will be completed in order to provide high quality electricity services to the existing urban consumers. In addition to this, strengthening and extensive expansion work in the existing distribution system will be done in order to provide sufficient and high quality services for the increased urbanisation and industrialisation at Dharan, Hetauda, Parwanipur, Birgunj, Butwal  \\tand Siddharthanagar (Bhairahawa). A systematic consolidation programme of the distribution system in Kathmandu valley, which  consumes the highest electric energy in the kingdom, will be formulated and implemented. The strengthening programme will raise the percentage of population with access to electricity in the urban areas to 75 percent from the existing 62 percent with an estimated addition of about, 60,000 consumers within the Eighth Plan. d. \\tRural Electrification Electricity is yet to be extended too many rural areas of the country. This programme has, therefore, been implemented with a view to gradually electrifying the rural areas where majority of the people live. The central grid system and micro hydro -electric projects will be used for achieving rural electrification. Electrification from the Central Grid: Electrification work will be undertaken in about 1,200 villagei in Ilam, Jhapa, Sunsari, Morang, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha, Rautahat, Chitawan, Nawalparasi, Rupandehi, Kapilbastu, Kaski, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Dang, Banke, Bardia and Surkhet districts having high population Densities. This programme will benefit about 950,000 people of those areas. In addition to this, arrangements will be made for the implementation of other electrification projects identified by the ten year Master Plan. Electrification by Small Hydro-electric projects in Isolation: Small hydro -electric projects will be constructed in order to meet the rural electricity demand in the hills and Himalayan region. Electricity generation capacity under this programme will be increased by 3,260 KW during the plan period from the continuing and proposed projects. Construction of the Namche (600 KW), Achham (400 KW) and Tatopani second phase (1,000 KW) projects which were at the construction stage during the Seventh Plan period will be completed. In addition to these, the Khotang (500 KW), Kalikot (600 KW) and Dolpa (160 KW) projects will be constructed. Besides, at least five micro hydro-eleckric schemes for each hill district will be prepared and made available to the private sector with the objective of mobilising the private, sector in the generation of hydropower. e. Survey, Feasibility Study and Engineering Design Survey, feasibility study and design works of the following projects will be carried out during the Eighth Plan period: Financial resources will be sought after completing the detailed engineering design for implementation of the West Seti hydro -electric project (360 MW) and the Saptagandaki (225 MW) multipurpose project incorporating the irrigation component into it. Taking into consideration the necessity of selecting hydro -electric projects to meet the projected electricity demand in the beginning of decade 2060 BS (2003 AD) and thereafter, detailed engineering studies of appropriate projects meeting the electric load of the central grid will be conducted from among the projects such as the Upper Karnali (240 MW), B_gmati (140 MW), Kamala and Budhigandaki (600 MW). Feasibility studies of the Bhotekosi, Khimti Khola, Naumure and Lower Arun hydro -electric projects whose preliminary and pre-feasibility studies were undertaken in the Seventh Plan, will also be completed. As the generation capacities of the existing small hydro-electric stations in the hill and remote district headquarter and other important places are about to be fully utilised, studies will be conducted to seek appropriate power additions and alternatives for these places. A Master Plan for small hydro-electric projects will be prepared, and project implementation as well as additional studies will be carried out as required. f. Management of Electricity Demand In addition to the aforementioned programmes, necessary institutional arrangements will be made to effectively control the electricity leakage. Besides, extensive publicity programmes will be launched for load management and the use of efficient energy devices and other electric equipment. g. Institutional Strengthening of the Nepal Electricity Authority Strengthening the financial management and reforming general administrative management within NEA have become imperative in the policy context of developing NEA as an autonomous institution. In this context, necessary changes will be made in the management board of the Nepal Electricity Authority. This Authority has to be made capable and efficient in order to execute new projects effectively. This institution has initiated a programme to gradually reduce the number of employees because of the urgency to improve administrative management and curtail the administrative expenditure. The NEA will be inspired to undertake compulsory annual auditing of accounts in order to strengthen the financial management. The NEA will adopt required processes for curtailing unnecessary expenses. Besides, necessary measures will be taken to augment earning and profit. The Authority will be motivated towards increasing its income by adopting programmes for realising account receivables, reducing the unnecessary inventory and the selling of surplus electricity. The electricity tariff, however, will be kept as low as possible by cutting down expenses and adopting income generating processes. A taskforce has already been set up in order to enhance this process. Besides, the NEA will implement an effective programme for the load management of electricity to reduce peak load and electricity leakage. The authority will be made capable of transmitting electric energy compatible with the policy of encouraging the private sector in the generation and distribution of electric energy. Necessary institutional strengthening of the NEA will also be undertaken to achieve this objective. h. \\tElectricity Export Talks are being herd with India about the power export projects i.e. the Karnali (Chisapani) and pancheswor multipurpose projects, Budhigandaki high dam project and Saptakosi multipurpose project in the existing committees at different levels between the two countries. -Regarding these projects, following programmes have been incorporated: The Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose project: Arrangements will be made to carry out additional studies relating to winter sediment, environment and resettlement. The pancheswor Multipurpose Project: Having completed the necessary field survey for feasibility study, arrangements will be made to, move ahead with the preparation of the detailed project report in order to expedite the implementation of this project. The Budhigandaki High Dam project: The pre-feasibility study of this project has been completed. The detailed project report will be, prepared subsequent to the undertaking of additional survey with the financial assistance of the government of India. The Sapta Kosi Multipurpose Project: Arrangements will be made to undertake the feasibility study upon completion of the inception report subsequent to the composition of \\'working group of experts between Nepal and India relating to this project. Alternate Energy Development Programmes: a. Development of Micro Hydro-electric proj_ct Hydropower generation capacity will be increased by 5,000 KW during the plan period by implementing different micro hydroelectric projects. Of this target, 1250 KW, 1250 KW, 1250 KW, 750 KW and 500 KW respectively will be generated in the Eastern, Central, Western, Midwestern and Far Western regions. These targets are based on probable demand for electricity. If- increased demand is to be encountered, the generation capacity will be increased accordingly. The private sector will be encouraged to achieve the stipulated targets. b. \\tBio-gas Energy Development Programme An assessment of the livestock population in Nepal reveals that biogas plants capable of catering to the requirement of about one million households can be theoretically constructed. It is estimated that about 2400 MW equivalent of power can be obtained from these plants. There is a target to exploit up to 3% of the total potential during the Eighth Plan. During this period, 3D, 000 biogas plants _will be installed with 12,000 plants in the hilly region and the remaining 18,000 plants in the Terai region. It is estimated that power equivalent to 72 MW will be available from the targetted 30,000 biogas plants. Besides, these plants- will help to reduce the- use of chemical fertiliser with the release of high quality compost manure. Setting up of private companies will be encouraged to achieve the above biogas installation target. Necessary loan facility will be made available from financial agencies to the interested parties. Besides, action will be taken to provide support to the production of manpower required for the implementation of this progrpmme. c. \\tS olar Energy Development Programme There is a great prospect for utilizing the incessant solar energy in Nepal. About 300 days per year on an average are sunny due to the topographical and aspect features with a capacity to produce an average of 700 t() 809 watts per squaremetre. Since past few years, the solar energy is increasingly being put to domestic and other uses. The devices using solar energy are solar water heater, solar dryer, solar cooker, solar pump and solar generator. The solar water heater has become popular in the urban area and it is estimated that there are 20 manufacturers selling this type of equipment. Similarly, the use of solar cooker is also at the experimental stage and its cost, too, is very high. Regarding the solar pump, the Agriculture Development Bank has made experimental uses in the past. Solar photovoltaic cells have been used to a certain extent in the telecommunication and aviation sectors. Though it is somewhat expensive in the initial stage from the cost consideration, it has been found useful in the rural areas where other forms of energy may not be available. During this plan period, 5,000 solar water heaters, 2,500 solar dryers and 5,000 solar cookers _are targeted to be produced and distributed. Besides, a Master Plan wi11 be prepared for the diversification of the use of solar energy. An appropriate policy environment will be created to involve the private sector in the production of solar energy related equipment upon demonstration of technology about the us e of solar energy in different sectors. d. \\twind Energy Development Programme Utilisation of wind energy is still at the research stage in Nepal. But while considering its geographical feature, wind velocity etc., there is a possibility of developing wind energy. A preliminary study on wind energy in the Mustang region has already been completed which will be used to prepare and implement the programme in the first year of the Eighth plan. e. \\tBiomass Energy Development Programme It has already been mentioned above that more than 95 percent of the total energy consumption is being met from forest and biomass energy. But most of this energy is being wasted for nothing due to the unscientific use of fuelwood and other biogas fuels. A major contribution to the national energy scenario will be made if a technology is developed for their efficient use. A publicity campaign will, therefore, be launched for proper use of fuelwood and other biogas energy to bring about the use of technologies like densification (briquette production), gasification, carbonisation and the improved stoves. During the Eighth Plan, 250, 000 improved stoves (100,000 in the hills and 150,000 in the Terai) will be distributed. Implementati on Arrangement: The mobilisation of governmental and non -governmental agencies will be accelE\"_rated to bridge the widening  gap between electricity demand and supply as it has surfaced as the main constraint. Nepal Electricity Authority will implement the Arun-III, Kaligandaki and the west seti project with respective installed capacities of 201 MW, 100 MH and 360 MW.The non-governmental agencies will be encouraged to implement Jhimruk, Khimti and Modi with the installed capacities of 12, 48 and 10 MW respectively together with other smaller hydroelectric projects. Arrangements will be made to implement the micro hydro-electric projects in various hill districts through private investors at the local leve14 As for alternate energy, the private sector will be involved in the promotion of biogas, microhydro-electric project, improved stove, solar water heater etc. A programme will be implemented for a massive extension of the installation of bio-gas plants through the Agriculture Development Bank, other financial institutions, the private sector and non governmental organisations in co-ordination with forest and environment conservation programmes to control forest destruction. The plants will be installed with people\\'s participation at the individual and community levels. For this, His Majesty\\'s Government will continue to bear up to Rs 7,000 in the Terai and Rs 10,000 in the hills with the remaining cost to be borne by the beneficiaries. Arrangements in this regard have been made for the users to obtain loan from the Agriculture Development Bank and other financial institutions. Technical services, training programme and Research and Development will be conducted through the Biogas and Agriculture Equipment Development Private Ltd. in order to increasingly involve the private sector in the installation of biogas plants. Similarly, the Agriculture Development Bank, other financial institutions, non-governmental organisations as well as the private sector will be mobilised to expand the rural electrification programme. This programme will also be implemented at individual and community levels. For this programme, His Majesty\\'s Government will bear 50 percent and 75 percent of the total cost estimates respectively in the midhill region and the Himalayan region and the remaining balance will have to be borne by the users. Loan facilities to that extent will be made available from the Agriculture Development Bank and other financial institutions. Arrangements will be made to make technical services available through the private entrepreneurs and private organisations. Prior to the implementation of different projects related to water resources development, it is essential to collect and analyse different data pertaining to river flow and quantity of the concerned rivers associated with the projects, and the data on weathers and floods. Although these data are vital to the development of agriculture and water resources, due importance does not seem to have been attached to the use of these data in the implementation of water resources development projects during the past plan periods. Therefore, the collection and analysis of such data playa very important role in the development of agriculture and water resources. Progress during the Seventh Plan period 1. Five rain gauges, 12 climatological and two aerosynoptic stations were set up\\' during the Seventh Plan period. Similarly, \\'climatological record of Nepal\\' covering upto 1986 was brought out. 2. Commensurate with the objective of the collection and analysis of the data on rivers for the development of different water resources projects, the maintenance of hydrological stations and stream gauging work was continued. Installation and maintenance of 60 hydrological stations, refurbishing of sixteen numbers of cable ways and thirteen automatic water level recorders and installation of 15 sediment sample stations were accomplished. 3. Different observation and measurement stations were kept in operation; data books were brought out and other regular programmes kept in operation as usual during the two year period covering F.Y. 1990/91 and F.Y. Background of the Eighth Plan The Nepalese economy being predominantly based on agriculture, proper information on weather in the context agriculture and on river flows for the development of irrigation can help render the irrigation systems more reliable. As water resource alone is the principal resource of the country, its proper utilization may provide significant support to the national economy. Similarly, agriculture and other sectors may be supported by way of the development of wind and solar energy based on their data. The level of the negative impact of air pollution, caused by fast growing population in the country especially in the Kathmandu Valley, and increased urbanization and industrialization will be determined on the basis of such data. In the present context of continued reduction in soil fertility, the quantitative analysis of the nature of sediment flow from the rivers and the necessity of conducting the study on pollution surfacing now on the rivers as well have become imperative. The Eighth Plan relating to hydrology and meteorology has been formulate taking these factors into full consideration. Existing Problems 1. Nonreliability of data collected from various sources; inability to measure correctly; and deficiency in the matter of supervision. 2. Nonavailability of sufficient resources and skilled technical manpower for the processing of collected data and lack of effective improvement in data management. Inability to mobilize necessary resources in the processing of data on the expiry of the assistance provided by such organizations as UNDP and WMO in particular. 3. Inability to modernize with time the equipment of the observation find measurement stations. 4. Nonexistence of a laboratory for examining the qualitative status of the current meters. 5. Inability to procure spares in required quantities even though workshop is available for repair and maintenance of equipment. 6. Inability to follow in an effective way the guidelines for the operation and inspection of equipment, and inadequate training. 7. Shortage of trained staff in the collection of data. 8. Deficit of sources and means to make the processed data readily available. 9. Lack of effective coordination between the water resources planning and implementation units. Objectives 1. To avail weather forecast and necessary data for agriculture and water resources development. 2. To avail hydro-meteorological data and weather forecast necessary for the agriculture sector. 3. To study the river regime for hydro-power generation, development of irrigation and drinking water projects. 5. To make available data on solar insolation and wind patterns sources with a view to developing alternative energy. 6. To avail necessary data on study relating to air pollution in order to formulate health and industrial policies. 4. Flood forecasting of major rivers will be undertaken on a regular basis. 5. Improvement will be brought about in the operation of all stations installed till date. 6. The publication of data books will be continued after effecting qualitative improvement in the analysis and processing of the collected data. 7. Studies of major river basins as a whole will be undertaken. 8. Support will be provided to water resource projects by extending collection and analysis works of the sediment samples. Similarly analytical studies relating to the chemical properties of water will be initiated. Policies 1. Data pertaining to weather will be collected on a nationwide basis for water resources development flood control and watershed management. 2. Effective arrangements will be made through flood forecasting to minimize the loss of life and property. 3. Arrangements will be made to forward data \\'collected at various places to data processing centres through the fastest means. 4. Data essential for the development of wind and solar energy will be collected. 5. Arrangements will be made to make essential data available to all government, semi-government, non-government\\' and. private sector agencies involved in the development of irrigation and energy. 6. Collected data will publish every year. 7. Hydro-meteorological instruments measuring quality and characteristics will be improved and modernized. 8. The density of stations engaged in hydro-meteorological study will continue to be improved according to the international standards. 9. The guidelines for the operation of hydro-meteorological equipment and processing will be followed after making necessary effective modifications. 10. Arrangements will be made to get most of the processing works now being done at the central level carried out at regional offices. 11. Search for Technical assistance in the field of hydro-meteorology from the international. organizations and different countries will be continued. 12. More emphasis will be given on studies and data collection relating to wind, water, environmental pollution and climatic change. 13. Suitable training will be arranged for unskilled and semiskilled employees. 14. In order to bring about dynamism in the studies and research on glaciers and snow clad areas in the northern belt and to assess their impact on the atmosphere and environment, modern technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information system will be used. Allocation of Physical Targets 1. Fifty additional hydrological stations in total will be installed during the Eighth Plan with 5 in the Himalayan region, 15 in Hills and 14 in the Terai. In this way, the number of hydrologica\\'1 stations will be inc:r:eased to 150 at the end of the plan period. 2. Studies on sediment and water quality of 20 numbers of major rivers of the kingdom will be conducted, 3. Data collection relating to climate and flow measurement which has been introduced in most parts of the kingdom, will be continued. 4. Hydro-meteorological stations will be established in 5 different places and rain gauge stations in 10 different places of the Eastern Development Region. 5. Centres measuring air pollution will be set up at five places in Kathmandu Valley. 6. Data pertaining to glaciers and snow melt will be collected from the hydro-meteorological stations in the Himalayan region of the Kingdom. . 7. Similarly, study centres pertaining to wind pressure and solar energy will be set up in four appropriate places. 8. A long term plan will be formulated and gradually implemented. Current 1. Management of hydro-meteorological data Data collection and analysis pertaining to water-flow and climate from the hydro-meteorological stations set up in about 252 places of the Kingdom will be carried out on a regular basis. 2. Study of the Water Quality Data and details relating to sediment and water quality will be collected from 20 major rivers of the Kingdom and made available to water resources and watershed conservation projects. 3. Water Level Forecast The task of forecasting daily water level during flood in the rainy season or minimum flow during the dry season will be carried out. Support will be provided to water resource projects through the collection of flood data and flood forecasting. 1. Agro-Climatological zoning This programme will be initiated in the entire part of the Eastern Development Region during this plan period. Climatic zoning is targeted by this programme for specific crop compatible with crop diversification and the promotion of agro-enterprise. Five weather) stations and\". ten rain gauge stations will be set up under this programme. 2. Air Pollution study Equipment relating to air pollution is targeted to be installed to make the public aware about the negative impact in health from air pollution resulting from the increased population in the Kathmandu Valley and the continuously growing industrialization. People will be informed about the outcome of the analysis of the data collected from the air pollution equipment. There is a programme to setup five such cent:res in the Kathmandu Valley. 3. Snow and Glacier Hydrology It has, become necessary to analyze the quantity of snow melt in the high Himalayan region, as the water thus produced becomes available to the major rivers of the kingdom. Data pertaining to climate and water flow from the hydro-meteorological centres of the high Himalayan region will be collected and processed. This programme will be implemented at all centers of the high region of the Kingdom. For this modern technology like remote sensing and geographical information system will be used. 4. Wind and Solar Energy As a large sum of money is required to supply electricity in the entire hilly region, it appears desirable to develop the access to energy by utilising of wind and solar energy. In order to provide support to the feasibility study to be conducted in this regard, there is a programme to collect data from four automatic instruments to be installed during this plan period for measuring wind and solar energy. Details of Expenditure: A sum of Rs117 Million is expected to be spent in programmes related to hydrology and meteorology to be implemented in the Eighth Plan period. Out of this Rs 50.074 million is expected to be spent under capital expenditure and Rs 66.926 million in administrative expenses. All the expenses related to this programme will be borne by His Majesty\\'s Government. The details are as follows: Road and Other Transport Introduction: Physical infrastructures play an important role in the all round development of the country. The development of physical infrastructure not only accelerates the pace of economic growth of the country but also firmly supports the development of social and other sectors. Transport occupies the lead position among physical infrastructures because the development of other physical infrastructures such as communication and electricity also, depend upon it. The development of transport directly influences the development of both productive and social sectors, the former represented by agriculture, industry, commerce, etc. and the latter represented by education, health, etc. Taking this reality into consideration, special attention has been given to the development of the transport sector from the very beginning of the planned development. Situation of the National Transport system: The National Transportation system of Nepal has a blend of both the modern means of transportation such as  roads and bridges, airways, ropeways and railways on one hand, and the traditional means of transport such as foot trails, mule tracks and service tracks (for ox-driven carts) and suspension bridges for pedestrians, cableways and twineways, on the other. There is, however, still a predominance of traditional means of transport in the national transport system. The traditional means-such as foot trails, mule tracks, service tracks and main tracks still link major parts of the kingdom. An estimated 20,000 km of foot trails and small mule tracks is believed to exist allover the country. These traditional means of transport have been meeting the transport requirements of the people in the remote and hill districts. Several means of the traditional transport system are in risky states because the twineways, cableways etc; used for crossing streams and rivulets in the main trails do not seem to meet the required safety standards. Main tracks used as foot trails and mule tracks are also often found to be quite narrow. Due to this, the mobility in the hill and remote areas is difficult especially during the rainy season. It has not been possible to make the traditional means of transport cost effective and efficient because of the compulsion to use porters , horses, mules, sheep, bullock carts etc. employed in the transport of goods. A glance at the means of modern transport system reveals that the roads, bridges, and the airways occupy a prominent place in Nepal. These means so far constitute the main organs of the modern national transport system. An analysis of the magnitude of passenger and goods transport services provided by the modern transport means clearly reveals the lead position occupied by the road transport. The role of this transportation means is definitely important in as much as taking passengers to their destinations and carrying goods are concerned. This is evident from the increasing contributions made by the modern means of road transport like buses and trucks as well as from the increasing road lengths and an ever increasing number of vehicles plying on these roads. The importance of road transport is proven by the number of vehicles registered as of FY 1991/92 which stands at 103,718. The breakdown of IDl,841 vehicles registered as of June/July, 1992 by type is shown in Appendix - 1. As the means of road transport, make it possible to extend customer services to their very door steps, its importance is obviously increasing in comparison to other means of transport. Progress during the Seventh Plan: During, the Seventh Five Year Plan period (1985-1990) only 1169 km of roads were constructed which included 207 km black-topped, 659 km and gravelled and 303 km earthern against the respective target of 432 km, 734 km and 815 km. In this way, the achievement relative to the target was only 59 percent. Achievement in highway construction likewise registered a dismal 47.3 percent (551 km against a target of 1,165 km). In feeder roads, 198 km out of the targeted 498 km was completed recording only 38.6 percent achievement. However, 181 km roads have been built including the roads constructed under Integrated Rural Development Projects against the targeted 128 km. within urban areas, a total of 245 km road was built as against the target of 190 km. Ro ads totaling 882 km were, built under district level programmes, constituting 103 km black topped, 236 km gravelled, and 543 km earthen roads. (The achievements of Seventh Plan are given in Appendix-2.) As regards the construction of bridge\\'s in the Seventh Plan period, only 15 bridges were completed as against a target of 23. Towards suspension bridges, 105 of them were built by the central agency (Suspension Bridge Division) as against the target of 373. In addition, 41 bridges were built by the Remote Area Development Committee. Progress in Fiscal Years 1990/91 and 1991/92: The total length of the roads till the end of the Seventh Plan period was 7,330 km. By the end of FY 1990/91, this length reached 8,328 km with the addition of 504 km built during the interim period (1990/91). By 1991/92, the estimated road length in the kingdom reached 8,909 km with another addition of 581 km during that year (Appendices 3 and 4). Existing Problems A look at the achievements made in the road transport to date reveals that in spite of the initiation of the process to link various parts of the country with one another, a major portion of the country\\'s territory remains isolated. An estimated 8,909 km roads have so far been constructed. The road travel from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west can now be accomplished from within the country. Work has also begun to link the Terai, Hills and the Himalayan region to one another with roads. As a result of the increased road transport facility, there has been an increase in production activities in some\" ar.eas of the country. Major problems in the field of transport are as follows: 1. Existing transport system not being fully capable of linking most parts of the country with each other, it still takes a great deal of time to reach the mountainous and Himalayan regions from the Terai. It is for this reason that most of the areas of the kingdom are still not socially and economically integrated. 2. The reason for low traffic volume on the existing highways is due to road construction without sufficient prior technical and financial feasibility studies in the past. There are certain roads which are not completed as yet. The problem before the nation is how to make these roads economically viable. 3. The conditions of some of the highways are deteriorating in want of regular maintenance. Due to this very reason, even the roads in Kathmandu, the capital city, are worsening. Most of the roads have potholes and other deformities leading to an unexpected increase in the cost of vehicular movements. This persists as a national problem. 4. Modern transport system has not yet been effectively expanded to reach the rural areas. The development in transport has not even been able to uplift the rural people forced to live below poverty line. This sort of problem persists due to the inadequacy of farm to  market link roads. 6. The roads linking the cities with other important places are extremely long and in want of proper maintenance, the national transport costs are increasing through time. This factor, among others, has adverse affected the national balance of payment situation. 7. The environment is being adversely affected partly because due considerations were not given to the fragile mountain environment while constructing roads in the mountain and Himalayan Region. The development of road transport has thus caused environmental and pollution problems. 8. Together with road, airways, waterways, there are other ropeways, railways and conventional means of transport like trails and mule-tracks which also form the national transport system. It is, therefore, necessary to develop road transport system so as to integrate it with the total national system of transport. This type of integration is difficult without formulating a detailed master plan. Background of the eighth Plan: Although 8909 km roads have so far been built, 23 district headquarters are yet to be connected with the road links. There is still a great need for linking farms with market centres by roads in order to support the economy of the rural areas. It is no less urgent to facilitate the remote and the Himalayan regions with tracks, mule-tracks and the suspension bridges, because these places would probably need much time before road transport could be feasible. The road has great role in the development of infrastructures of others aspects, too. Road construction is also urgently needed for the development of sectors like electricity, industry, tourism and education. In view of the above mentioned aspects, the Eighth Plan has accorded high priority to road construction in order to help achieve higher and sustained rate of economic growth, to help alleviate poverty and to help lessen regional imbalances. Objectives: Following are the specific objectives of the road transport development to be implemented during the Eighth Plan: Policies: 1. To consolidate regional integration by linking various parts of the country in order to ensure high degree of interdependence among economically potential physiographic regions of the country. 2. To strike a balance in the development of various regions by supporting different programmes of national and economic importance related to tourism, agriculture, electricity, etc., in order to forge interlinkages between villages and the-market places. 3. To ensure favourable balance of payment by minimizing national transportation costs. Policies: Following policies will be adopted in the field of road transport to achieve the objectives listed above: 1. The main goal of this plan would be to develop a national transportation system with a view to making the means of transport like roads, bridges, main trails, ropeways, waterways and airways complementary to each other in interlinking various potential areas of the country towards their economic betterment. The prevailing road classification under national road transport system has been given in Appendix 5. A National transport Master Plan will be formulate_ to achieve the main goal stated above. The Master Plan will ease to identify the appropriate model to help the structural development of national transportation system in -the coming years. Due emphasis in the long term Master Plan will be given to the promotion of regional equity. In addition, special attention will be given to interlink national transportation systems with regional and international railways and highways. The National Transport Master Plan will cover a 20 year span in order to attain planned development of road network. 2. Emphasis will be given to the construction of bridges and culverts, and necessary improvements will be made in the main-tracks of Terai and the remote mountainous regions. Besides, rural transportation system will be expanded and made safer and more dependable by developing the modern twineways. and ropeways. 3. High priority will be given to the completion of the remaining portions of east-west and north -south highways. 4. Special priority will be given to the maintenance of existing highways of national and regional importance. In the same way, adequate financial provisions will be made in the regular budget for the regular maintenance of roads based on their maintenance status and length. In addition, certain portion of road-toll It will be allocated for exclusive road maintenance purpose. 5. Specific criteria will be developed to levy toll on the uses of roads and bridges to support their regular maintenance. Arrangement will be made to introduce toll taxes, and the revenue thus generated will be used exclusively for maintenance purposes. 6. Priority will be given to the construction of roads to link construction sites of various projects of national significance as has been done with the hydro electric projects. The formulation and implementation of such road projects will be incorporated within the programme of the concerned agency as far as possible. 7. As the role of urban roads is important in the development and expansion of towns in the kingdom, the maintenance and standardization of urban roads will be undertaken together with the construction of additional roads under town development programmes. 8. Special emp hasis will be given to the construction of link roads joining farms to market places or linking the agricultural production centres and the local market centrs in the districts.\\' People\\'s participation will be mobilized in the construction and the maintenance of such projects. Priorities will be given to those projects where greater degree of participation can be ensured. District Development Committees will be involved in the selection, formulation and the operation of these projects. Care will be taken to preserve environment from being adversely affected while constructing and expanding the roads. Environmental aspect of the project will be thoroughly evaluated prior to the implementation of road projects based on their respective nature. 9. Most areas in the country are still deprived of road facilities. Only 52 district headquarters in the kingdom are connected by the existing road network. Efforts will, therefore, be made to connect the hitherto unconnected districts by roads in a phased manner. Towards this end, construction will be initiated to provide minimum level of road facilities. Besides, simple construction methods will be adopted in the construction of north south roads to make them good enough for the dry seasons and with lesser vehicular congestion commensurate with the investment. 10. Emphasis will be given to the construction of bridges and the culverts over the Terai and mountain rivers which are often flooded in the rainy season causing transport inconveniences. 12. Towards the rural transport, a policy of giving priority to the construction of mule-tracks in the Himalayan region, service tracks in the hilly regions and cart-tracks in the Terai region will be adopted. 13. Long term traffic projection, landslide situation, environmental situation and locally available technologies will be considered determining the technical standards of the roads and highways to be constructed particularly in the hilly region. Likewise, geo-physical and engineering technologies oriented towards solving the road construction problems in the mountains will be adopted by establishing mountain risk engineering and environment unit within the Department of Roads. 14. Considering the potential contribution of Royal Nepal Army in the development works, the army cadres will be mobilized in the construction of roads in the \\'Eighth Plan. 15. Projects will be classified as central level and district level in order to attain maximum achievements in the construction of roads, bridges and other means of transport. The projects of national importance will be kept at the central level and those having more of a local importance will be centrally supported in the form of district level programmes and projects. 16. Separate guidelines for road and bridge standard, specification, contract document, contract method and work sequencing will be prepared for roads and bridges projects in the hills and Tarai with hig h and low traffic density as well as the district level road projects. 17. The activities like dense tree plantation on both sides of roads and the rivers as well as in the areas possessed by the government, possession of areas outside road limits prone to landslides, and the takeover of the areas considered as road limits, will be conducted in order to protect roads from landslides and soil erosion. Apart from the help from central agencies, people I s participation will be mobilized with the involvement of the non-governmental agencies. 18. Primary survey and feasibility study will be dome in order of priority determined by Road Network Master Plan prepared for the detailed survey design and the feasibility studies of roads and bridges for national and dis trict level projects. But detailed survey and design works will only be conducted for those sections of the roads which fall in the yearly construction programme. 19. A separate departmental tevel agency will be set up to more effectively construct and maintain the bridges, culverts, suspension bridges, cableways etc. meant to cross rivers and rivulets intersecting important foot trails, mule-tracks, and cart tracks. 20. An urban roads master plan will be prepared to develop the roads in important big and medium size cities and towns. Municipalities will be supported to enable them to maintain roads within their jurisdiction. Preference will be given to the construction of roads under town development programmes. But special attention will be given to the construction of footpaths, bicycle lanes, zebra crossings, overbridges, bus- stops and subways at appropriate points, to ensure the safety of the pedestrians while building roads in the urban areas. 21. Care will be taken about petrol pumps, vehicular maintenance, telephone, and other roadside facilities in both existing highways and those to be c9nstructed in the future. 22. In order to make the role of private sector more effective in the construction of roads and bridges, necessary improvements will be made in the existing rules and regulations. Methods like the \"Build-Own - Operate-Transfer\" will be practised to attract national and foreign investors for the purpose of mobilizing private sector investment for the construction of short distance tunnel roads and bridges, on the basis of economic feasibility studies, in those areas which already have road facilities. Special incentives will also be arranged, if necessary, by initiating appropriate mechanism for it. 23. Emphasis will be given to the development of domestic construction industries to ensure timely and prompt completion of the constructions of roads, bridges and other means of transport. Necessary steps will be taken to create conducive atmosphere to enable the Nepalese contractors related to construction industries and the construction companies in Nepal to enter into competitive bidding in construction projects of international standard. 24. Priority will be given to the mountainous and Himalayan regions for the construction of suspension bridges. 25. An equipment maintenance and operation unit will be established to operate and maintain the !road construction and maintenance equipment. Priorities: Following priority order has been determined in the development of road transport in the Eighth Plan: 1. Remaining portions of East-West and North-South Highways and other on-going projects, 2. Roads to link those districts which have not been linked so far, 3. Maintenance and reconstruction of highways and other important road projects in operation. 4. Roads to support large and medium size hydro-electric projects, 5. Roads projects like Sindhuli-Banepa with enhanced economic viability and significant potential for economic development, 6. Rural transportation development projects like farm to market roads, improvements of main trails including foot tracks, mule tracks, main through-fares and the suspension bridges which directly benefit the rural areas. Major Programmes: Following programmes will be undertaken to attain the desired objectives and targets: A. Programmes on rehabilitation, periodic maintenance and reconstruction of roads (including those damaged), B. \\tProgrammes on) the construction and upgrading of roads and bridges, c. \\tProgrammes on rural transportation development. Together with the completion of the above programmes, the Eighth Plan envisages to construct 2,978 km road (1,778 km and 1,200 km of roads at central and district levels respectively) within the plan period. In addition, 1083 kilometres of highways and the feeder roads will be rehabilitated, and the damaged sections of 1475 km of other loads will be repaired. Similarly, 48 km of damaged roads will b e reconstructed during the plan period. There is a target of constructing 830 and 125 km. of mule tracks and tractor tracks respectively as they are important means of rural transportation. In addition, D. 500 suspension bridges and 25 motorable bridges are targeted to be built in various parts of the country. An additional 14 districts will be linked with motorable roads within the Eighth Plan period. A. \\tProgrammes on the Rehabilitation, Periodic Maintenance and Reconstruction of Roads Three major activities will be undertaken in this programme namely i) consolidation, ii) timely maintenance, and iii) reconstruction of Roads. This programme will help in minimising national -transportation cost consequently relieving-the budget deficit situation. 1. Rehabilitation of Roads The standard of highways and the feeder roads will be decided on the basis of the traffic density on these roads. Rehabilitation works will be initiated to enable 1,083 km roads to bear increased traffic loads. 2. Periodic Maintenance and Reconstruction Programme This programme has been included, with special priority to repair and reconstruct the currently serviceable highways, feeder roads and othe r roads considering the present road-condition of the kingdom with a view minimize the costs of transport services. 3. Reconstruction of Damaged Roads This programme has been included to re-construct roads and bridges damaged by landslides, floods etc. During the Plan period, 48 km of such roads as identified in Table 3 below will be reconstructed. Note: \\tRiver-training works at various sectors of East-West Highway will also be done under this programme. Constructions of damaged bridges are included under the motorable bridge programme. B. Road Construction and Upgrading Programme Road Construction Programme (Central Level): -To cater to the increasing demand of road transports, programmes have been prepared for the construction of additional roads and upgrading the standards of others. The roads to be constructed under this programme are expected to fulfill the objective of ensuring regional integration and complementarities. . 1. Highway Construction A total of 763 km highways are targetted to be built by implementing various programmes during the Plan period. Of the target, 48 km black-topped, 149 km gravelled and 566 km earthen motorable roads will be built. Kohalpur- Mahakali portion, an important portion of the East-West Highway, will be completed with highest priority. Besides the above mentioned highways, feasibility studies will be conducted for the construction of short distance links, like the Hetauda-Kathmandu freeway tunnel, under the principles of Build-Own -Operate-Transfer by involving the private sector. Specific details on this are presented in Table 4 below: 2. Feeder Roads Construction A total of 915 km feeder roads will be constructed during the Eithth Plan period, which includes 89 km black- topped, 205 km gravelled, and 621 km earthen roads. A. Feeder Roads to Highways In accordance with the policy of making the already existing highways, and also those under construction, more potential from economic point of view by building feeder roads, 8 feeder road projects will be implemented under the Highway feeder roads construction programme. The physical targets of the projects under this programme are as given in the table below: 3. Urban Roads Construction Urban Road construction and repair works programme is included to manage the increasing urbanization and develop\\' and expand the roads to meet the increasing traffic pressure in\\' cities like Kathmandu, Laitpur. Biratnagar. Birgunj etc., and involve the municipalities in the task. Kathmandu is being polluted due to its uncontrolled expansion. In order to reduce the river pollution and prevent adverse environment conditions that may result, roads along the riversides will be expanded and improved. Also during the Eighth Plan Period, stepwise programmes will be implemented following necessary studies on the extent of urbanization and the road-situation in Kathmandu Valley. Bishnumati Link Road will be constructed to reduce the problems raised by the increasing traffic pressure in core areas\\' of Kathmandu city. During the Eighth Plan period. 100 km urban road will be built including 50 km black-topped 25 km gravelled and 25 km earthen besides the repair and reconstruction of other urban roads. 4. Farm to Market Road and District Road Construction (District Level) It is necessary to render various existing highways and feeder roads, and those under construction economically viable. Therefore, it is proposed to construct farm to market roads and district roads network to support agricultural production in the areas where roads exist and where they will be constructed in the near future. These roads will be constructed with minimum investment soliciting the people\\'s participation with a view to fulfilling the local necessities. In the same way these roads will be built in the hilly regions as dry-season-roads and in the Terai regions as fair weather-roads by constructing low cost bridges and culverts. A total of 1,200 _m additional roads (480 km in the hills and 720 km in the Terai) will be built under this programme. These roads will be generally built in the form of earthen and gravelled roads. These roads will gradually be black- topped and gravelled on the basis of their economic importance. Besides, the proposed roads projects listed in appendix 6 will be gradually implemented after reviewi!1g their techno-) economic feasibilities and on the basis of resource availability. The purpose of regional balance will be achieved by this programme since it will support the development of rural areas. In addition, the proposed farm to market links will make the highways and other roads economically viable as per the policy. 5. Construction of Motorabie Bridges The bridges to be constructed within the plan period will be Trishuli Bridge (Dhading), Tilawe Bridge (Parsa), Sirsia Bridge (Raxaul-Birgunj Parsa), Devinia Bridge (Jhapa), Babai Bridge (Amelia-Tulsipur,Dang), 3 bridges on MRM Gaighat Road, 4 bridges on Kathmandu roads, seti Bridge (Kaski),Vijaypur Khola Bridge (Kaski), Rapti Sidhania Bridge (Banke), Daduwa River Bridge (Banke), and Sali River Bridge (Kanchanpur). In the same way feasibility studies and surveys of other bridges will be undertaken as required. Rural Transportation Development Programme Nepal\\'s economy is still dependent on the rural areas where majority of people live. sustainable economic development in the country would be difficult to achieve if rural areas are not properly developed. But the development of villages is presently hindered by the, lack of transport facilities. The limited available resources available do not possibly allow road construction in each and every village. In view of the required size of investment, it would take a long time to link every village with the roads. The normal movement of the common rural people will be comfortable and safe if the conventional means of transport like foot -trails, mule -tracks, service tracks, suspension bridges, cableways and twineways used for crossing the rivers or rivulets are improved. Keeping this policy in mind, due emphasis is given to the rural transportation development programme under which these conventional means of transport will be developed and improved. The suspension bridges on the main trails will be built as central level projects while the remaining bridges will be built under district level programmes. 1. Construction and Improvement of Foot Trails, Mule Tracks and Service Tracks Construction and improvement of 830 km of tracks, mule tracks existing as main trails at the local level will be undertaken during the Eighth Plan period and an additional 125 km service tracks will also be constructed during the said period. 2. Construction and Improvement of Suspension Bridges Therefore, in order to facilitate the movements of the rural people with comfort and safety, emphasis will be given to the construction of suspension bridges in the Eighth Plan period. High echnology suspension bridges on the nationally important main trails will be constructed as central level projects. The suspension bridges -lying on the local tracks which may be built at low cost through local technologies will be constructed at district levels. The target is to build 500 suspension bridges in the kingdom during the Eighth Plan period of which 100 will be on the rivers falling in the main trails. 3. Construction and Improvement of Twineways and cableways The need for bridges is evident for the rural Nepalese people who stay in scattered settlements and who often have to cross rivers and rivulets in the course of regular movements from house to farms and other places. It is, however, not possible to construct suspension bridges with high technology due to resource limitations. Modern cableways and twineways (rope bridges) will, therefore, be built in different areas depending on the traffic density to be revealed by survey studies. Within the Eighth Plan period, 100 such twineways and cableways are targeted to be built and repaired in different parts of the kingdom. Miscellaneous 1. \\tstudy Research and Survey Studies will be conducted to support the construction, expansion and. improvement of roads and bridges. These include feasibility studies, detailed survey, traffic engineering and environmental studies. The road projects to be stud ied during the Eighth Plan period are given in Appendix-6. 2. Road Laboratory In order to maintain quality in the construction of roads, it is necessary to test the soil, and the construction equipment to be used for the purpose. Therefore, road laboratories will be strengthened and equipped with required facilities. 3. Availability of Construction Materials, Equipment and Spare Parts Construction materials, equipment and the spare parts are needed during the road construction. Department of Roads is not on ly inadequately equipped with such facilities but also the available equipment lay idle due to lack of spare parts. The need for construction materials and equipment is felt in order to timely complete the construction works in district level projects main taining sufficient quality. It is, therefore, proposed to make the construction machinery and equipment like bull-dozers, graders, road rollers, trippers, trucks and the spare parts available for district level road construction works involving the participation of the people. 4. Development of organizational support Services Provisions for physical and other support services for the road development works have been made including the construction of a new office building for the Department of Roads as the available space has become too inadequate. Likewise, a workshop will be established for the purpose of repairing the road construction machinery and equipment. 5. Incomplete Projects The incomplete construction projects started in the past years will,be completed. Implementation Arrangements The arrangements for implementing the roads and bridges projects have been made at the central and district levels based on their respective importances. District and Village Development Committees, Users\\' Committees, and other local agencies will be actively involved in the district level roads development activities. Likewise, the private sector will also be involved in the construction of roads. Royal Nepalese Army will also be involved in it. In the same way, a regular process of programme review, work evaluation and monitoring will be conducted for the works to be done under central and district level programmes. Details of Expenditure The implementation of the above programmes is estimated to cost a total of Rs 12,329 million the allocation of which will be as given in Table 7 below: Due attention, therefore, has been given to the development of these transport means as it will benefit the whole economy. Progress during the Seventh Plan Under the programme of construction, expansion and rehabilitation of the ropeways, the preliminary and rehabilitation studies were undertaken to meet the set target of extending the existing Kathmandu-Hetauda Ropeway facilit y up to Amlekhgunj. In addition, a study has been done to assess the feasibility of Khaireni- Manakamana cable -car service. Towards railway rehabilitation and study activities, the study on rehabilitation works of Janakpur-Jayanagar and reconstruction of Ra xaul-Amlekhgunj railways have been completed. Under the programme of construction, expansion and rehabilitation of the ropeways, the preliminary and rehabilitation studies were undertaken to meet the set target of extending the existing Kathmandu-Hetauda Ropeway facilit y up to Amlekhgunj. In the same way, the master plan for the development of trolley-bus could not be started. But the studies regarding the Operation of Trolley-buses at Biratnagar-Dharan, Bhairahawa-Butwal and Suryabinayak-Banepa sectors are already completed. With regard to the study of bus terminals of long distance bus services under public transport services, the studies for the development of bus -terminals in Kakarbhitta, Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, and Nepalgunj have been done in addition to the one in Kathmandu. Studies on Multi-Model containerization have been completed as targetted regarding containerized transport system. Operation of IIJet\"!artz\\'lI test survey has been completed as targetted under the study programme in order to see the possibility of developing waterways in the important rivers like Koshi and Narayani, whereas preliminary surveys have been conducted in Karnali, Seti, Bheri,saptakoshi, Sunkoshi, Arun, Tamor and Dudhkoshi. But works could not be initiated with respect to studies of the development of modern boat-technology in order to support the private sector in this activity. Existing Problems The progress scenario of the other means of transport during the Seventh Plan is not in any way satisfactory. No noteworthy improvement is observed in the fields of railways and ropeways. The railways and ropeways should not operate to their capacity mainly due to the lack of proper and regular repair and maintenance. In the same way, trolley-bus facilities could not be expanded due to the lack of adequate financial resources with Nepal Transport Corporation, and the non-availability of external resources in time. Transport costs could not be reduced \\'in the foreign trade sector in a notable manner. Traffic as well as pollution has been increasing in the urban areas, but a substantial solution to this problem is yet to emerge. Background of the Eighth Plan Impressive achievements have been made in road and air transport in the past. The-progress in other sectors of transport has not been as satisfactory. In considering the fuel needs for the operation of the other means of transport like waterways, ropeways\" railways and trolley buses, the water transport system needs only small amount of fuel, whereas railways, ropeways and trolley-buses can be conducted by electric power. This can reduce the country\\'s re1iance on petroleum products. Viewed from environmental point of view, they will create the least water, air and sound pollution with regard to initial investment and operation expenses, railways, trolley- buses and the ropeways are quite costly. The contributions made by these means of transport in the total system are, however; very important. It has become necessary to have dependable and efficient system of transport from Calcutta to Nepal, since Calcutta is the nearest sea port for the export and import of goods to and from Nepal. In this context, it would be a great achievement if the railways reaching Nepalese border are turned into broad- gauge with the assistance of India. Since containerized transport is safest and most effective, it is necessary to work for its development. In the face of the developed countries moving towards producing things in time when needed rather than stocking the products for long, if our export products are not safely transported in time the importing nations may not accept them. Therefore, it is needed to adopt a multi-model transport operation system for door to door delivery of goods. 1. To keep the transit system of the kingdom simp le and well organised and operates it in an effective manner. 2. To develop the ropeways, railways, water-ways and the trolley buses in a systematic manner, 3. To develop the public transport in a way to minimize the environmental pollution. 3. To establish and expand the transport system to be operated by locally available electric power in order to reduce the consumption of imported petroleum fuel. 4. To continue working towards the development of waterways on the important rivers, if technically feasible. 5. To explore the possibility of linking the internal waterways with Indian waterways and develop it in that line to the national benefit. 6. Public transport services to be made more comfortable, safe \\tand \\tregular. 10. To consolidate the existing railways, ropeways and the trolley buses and be operate them in full capacity. 11. To encourage the private sector in the development of short distance rope -ways for tourism development and to mobilise public participation in the development of gravity ropeways. 12. To extend Trolley-bus services to reduce air pollution by the public transport services. 13. To attract private and foreign investors in organizing driving schools and workshops for repairs and maintenance and to effect necessary reforms in rules and regulations to systematically operate the public transport services. 14. To privatise and further activate Nepal Transport Corporation by involving it in foreign trade and transit systems in the changed economic context. 15. To initiate an institutional system\\' in connection with the control and inspection of the means of transport in order to reduce the air pollution to the least by the public transport and other services being operated in big or mediu m sized cities. Agencies related to it will be made effective. Programmes In accordance with the objectives detailed in the Eighth Plan, the projects related to the development of other means of transport will be as follows: A. Development of Ropeways From Fifth Plan onwards, all plans have emphasized towards improving and consolidating the\\' ropeways operated under Nepal Transport Corporation, and to standardize its services. During the Eighth Plan period, transportation activities will be made simpler, easier and more effective, and this will be possible only by extending ropeway transport in the mountainous regions like Surkhet-Jumla by consolidating Hetauda-Kathmandu ropeway. In addition, experimental programme of gravity ropeway will be undertaken after due studies. B. \\tRailways As for railways, the Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bijalpura railway is operated by Nepal Transport Corporation though its consolidation has begun right from the Fifth Plan, it still remains in a very delicate condition. In addition, the feasibility studies will be conducted with regard to metre -guaged railway lines in the sectors of Bhairahawa-Butwal and Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bardibas. RaxaulBirgunj railway, which is highly significant from transportation point of view, will be constructed by upgrading it to broad-gauge. C. \\tDevelopment of Trolley Bus Services The trolley bus service, operated with electric power, was initiated in the fiscal year 1975/76. The 13 km.long Bhaktapur-Kathmandu trolley bus system, operated from the Fifth Plan, has been offering its services. With a view to minimize the imported fuel consumption, trolley bus services will be extended to Tripureshwor-Kirtipur and Thappthali-Patan Gate-pulchowk during the Eighth Plan period. Important contribution will be made to reduce the\\'pressu_e of vehicles in the urban roads, if trolly buses are operated throughout Ring Road of Kathmandu. Therefore, a 15 km. trolley- bus service will be operated in Teenkune-Chabahil-Maharajgunj sector. In addition, to facilitate the people of Itahari and other commuters, a.22 km trolley bus service will be implemented between Itahari and Biratnagar. D. \\tInternal waterways If the perennially flowing rivers are used for the operation of waterways, the cost of transportation of goods, will be reduced considerably. Detailed engineering survey will, therefore, be done to prepare elaborate profiles of such rivers. Appropriate means of transport to be employed in the waterways transport will also be identified. Within the Eighth Plan period, the profiles of 187 km. long Ramdighat-Narayanghat-Bhaisalotan waterways will be prepared and appropriate means of transportation will be identified.Likewise, factual profile and.situation of waterways will be identified in the Gandak river stretch of Bhaisolotan down to the river Ganga. Services will be operated in the areas seen feasible. E. \\tContainerized Transportation System. In accordance with the trade and transit agreement between Nepal and \\'India, the goods imported from the third countries would reach Raxaul, Nepal, and then to different places of the kingdom. The infrastructural development for this programme will be, implemented within this plan period. F. \\tTraffic \\'Pollution control system Urban environment is being increasingly polluted by different kinds of pollutants originating ,from various means of transport. Therefore, various traffic pollution control works will be launched by making Transport Management Department capable of controlling traffic pollution in the bigger cities like Kathmandu and others. Details of Expenditure It is proposed to spend Rs 1,235 million in programmes and projects related to the development of various other means of transport. In the backdrop of the significance of communication in accelerating and sustaining the pace of development, communication is considered as an essential infrastructure. By virtue of the dominant role it can play in the flow of information, communication has a momentous and sensitive role in the task of acquainting the people with democratic norms and values and achieving the development targets through people\\'s participation. Nobody can disregard the efficacy of the communicatio n media in helping to make the people conscious and keep them well informed by effectively delivering the information on basic matters such as health, agriculture, family planning and education and to solve the country\\'s problems by forming a creative andstrong public opinion involving various groups and parties representing different ideologies towards finding solutions to national and international problems. In the Context of our inability to achieve minimum standard/of living expected of a human being owing to poverty and illiteracy, the communication sector stands out even more conspicuously in its importance as a developmental infrastructure for a balanced pace of development. As the development of the communication sector is a must in the process of national development, it is imperative to remain alert with due sensitivity in the development of communication for facilitating a convenient and easy access of the people to fundamental constitutional rights by transforming the people into conscious citizens. Taking into consideration these perspectives, the development and expansion of the communication services has been accorded a significant place in the Eighth Plan. Progress during the Seventh Plan: \\uf095\\uf020\\tSaving bank services through post offices 25 In addition, necessary materials required\\' for strengthening of postal services were made available and training relating to postal services was imparted to 562 trainees. A sorting centre was also established at Birgunj during the plan period. b. Telecommunication Services 1. Expan_fon of local telephone lines (no. of lines) \\t51,980 2. Expansion of Telex exchange capacity -(no. of lines) 256 In addition to the above, achievements, the digital microwave trunk route serV1ce has been established and operated at Ilam in the east and up to Mahendranagar in the west. Similarly, measures to improve the management, organisation and maintenance of telecommunication media were undertaken and the construction of off ice buildings, godowns and resident quarters for\\\\the employees was completed. The countrywide medium wave transmission programme has already been operated by completing the feasibility study. It will help the medium wave radio transmission stations to make distinctly audible broadcasts to almost all the regions of the country. Under this programme, medium wave transmission has already been operational from, Dhankutta, Dharan and Bardibas during the Seventh Plan period and the construction of medium wave radio stations at Surkhet and Dipayal has been started. d. Television Services Telecasting has already been initiated from Kathmandu, Biratnagar, Pokhara and Hetauda during the Seventh Plan period against the plan target of extending television services in the country by undertaking feasibility study. Works relating to the link Biratnagar transmission centre with the Kathnandu centre has also been completed. Similarly, the feasibility study to link the Pokhara centre with the central transmission has been completed. Construction work of the studio building of the Nepal Television has also been started. e. National News servi ce Construction of buildings has been completed with the people\\'s participation at Doti and Bharatpur for the development of national news service. Equipment has been supplied to, the National News Committee in accordance with the objective of making available some office equipment, news collection and printing equipment to the committee during the plan period in order to improve the quality of news services. f. Printing services Works relating to procurement of additional printing machinery, construction of store rooms and buildings etc. and the feasibility study of security press have, been completed in order to increase the printing capacity of the press under the Department of, Printing. During the Plan period, 38 newsreels were prepared by the Department of Printing as the responsibility of preparing documentaries and newsreels has been shifted from the Department of Press Information to the Department of Printing. Distribution of 353,000 posters portraying different important personalities of the country was done during the Plan period. g. Press Information services As the preparation of the documentary films, newsreels and poster publication and, distribution under the Department of Press Information have been shifted to the Department of Printing, the review relating to this has already been done under the Printing Services head. h. Gorakhapatra Works relating to the addition of printing equipment for the publications of the Gorakhapatra Corpdration, arrangement of delivery van etc. for timely sale and distribution of daily publications, repair and maintenance of the central building with the addition of a floor have been completed. An offset press, a composing machine, a camera, a photo lens, an enlarger, a composing and\\' page making desk and a computer have been purchased. Three wheeler vans and bicycles have also been purchased for quick delivery of published materials. i. Film Production The Royal Film\\' corporation produced only a total of four feature films during the Plan period. The target was to make the film corporation self reliant through film making upon the receipt of loan from the banks and the establishment of the laboratory by completing the construction work of the building. Nevertheless, the setting up on the laborat9ry has reached its final stage. j. Recording Services Shree Ratna Recording Corporation has recorded and produced discs and cassette tapes of 354 commercial and prayer songs etc. Shree Ratna Recording Corporation has been merged with the Nepal Television Corporation because of its inability to proceed towards self reliance by itself. k. Frequency Management and Radio Monitoring Frequency Management and Technology Analysis Division has been set up in the Ministry of Communications in order to undertake the frequency management and radio monitoring works. Its capacity has also been augmented a little with the receipt of some equipment with ITU assistance. Progress during F.Y. 1990/91 and F.Y. 1991/92 a. Postal Services 1. Money order services expansion through post offices (no.) 25 231 In addition to these, the construction works of the post office buildings at Kalikot and Terhathum have also been completed. b. Telecommunication service 1. Expansion of local telephone lines (no. of lines) \\t6,040 2. Expansion of STD service (no. of places) \\t2 Radio transmission has been started from Surkhet by establishing the medium wave transmission station at Surkhet as well as at Dipayal. However, regular transmission from Dipayal has not been possible due to the lack of reliable power supply. d. Television Transmission In addition to this, works relating to the procurement of audio-visual equipment, production of programmes, collection, purchase, and transmission of programmes; completion of the construction of the studio building; organisation of training/seminars; and repair and maintenance of equipment were all completed as targetted. e. Printing Services Four documentary films were produced and released by the Department of Printing. f. Rastriya Samachar Samiti The Rastriya Samachar Samiti had no development programme during FY 1990/91. Construction of dark room and installation of telefax machines were accomplished during FY 1991/92. g. Frequency Management and Radio Monitoring No special programme relating to development works was implemented under this project during FY 1991/92. Processing work has been initiated after setting up of a colour film laboratory under the Royal Nepal Film Corporation. Commencement of print production activity is still awaited due to incomplete set of machine supplied. Existing Problems Though predominance of the role of communication sector in the process of national development is a proven reality, the communication services in Nepal have remained quite insufficient till now. The situation is such that it has not been possible to supply different communication facilities to urban areas as per demand and almost all villages of our country are deprived of modern communication facilities. The construction of radio stations in required places of the country has just recently been completed for the medium wave transmission of Radio Nepal. Now, Radio Nepal has become the only communication medium in Nepal capable of reaching the general public. Though it is estimated that radio transmission will reach- clearly to about 90% of people, the condition does not permit all to enjoy even this facility due to the lack of their purchasing power. In addition to radio, postal, services, telecommunication, television and periodicals etc. are very much out of reach of the common people. As long as these media can not reach amidst the common people, awareness can not be generated among the people to the desired extent and its direct consequence may be reflected in terms of political instability and e6onomic deprivation of the nation. Therefore, the detailed study of the existing problems in this sector and their solution is essential. Main problems in this sector are as follows: 1. Development of media autonomy and promotion of healthy journalism is still poised as a challenge 1n the communication sector. Also, the quality of the periodicals needs to be improved in addition to increasing their circulation. It is essential to proceed towards the promotion of healthy journalism by extending full autonomy to the communication media under the government, as healthy journalism is not only a real guide to the government but also a carrier of correct information to the people. 2. It has not been possible to provide essential postal services to almost half the number of villages in the country. The Seventh Plan statistics revealed that one post office provided services to 8,100 people in an area of 66 sq. km. Prompt service can not be provided without substantially reducing this poor coverage figure. 3. The transmission of efficient medium such as television has been able to cover some urban areas only. The reality that 75 percent of the people of the country can not benefit from the transmission of television persists even now as this service can only be provided to areas having access to electricity. At the same time, as the economically deprived people cannot access this facility by thef1lselves, there is a need to establish community television centres to avail this facility to them. 4. Though substantial progress has been made towards the development and. extension of communication services, this service has to be increasingly oriented towards other areas from the standpoint of equity, as this has been concentrated in the urban-areas especially within the Kathmandu Valley. It will be difficult to go against the principle of cost/benefit in its establishment and extension due to the fact that the most modern telecommunication services are extremely costly. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually provide this service in the rural areas by cross-subsidising the cost and without much regard to quantifiable benefit/cost. 5. It is also necessary for mass communication media to provide social services in addition to commercial services without which it will be difficult to generate social awareness among the people. But there is a likelihood of inadequacy of such services as the social and educational services do not generate sufficient returns to the media. For this, a convention has to be set to formulate progratnmes related to the mass people such as education, health, agriculture etc. in a coordinated manner. 6. The programmes transmitted through mass media have to be standard and effective as the programmes transmitted by radio and television greatly influence the people. In order to achieve this it is essential to pay special attention to the establishment of an appropriate training centre, development of skilled manpower and also the procurement and maintenance of equipment. 7. The existing situation of running the economically unviable corporations with the limited resources and means of His Majesty\\'s Government can not be considered a healthy practice. With an unbiased study of the corporations associated with services other than the extremely sensitive ones such as education and public health, it is advisable to dissolve or handover them to the private sector for effective management. Background of the Eighth Plan: In view of the important role the communication sector is expected to play in a country like ours lacking in developed transport facilities and fettered with severe geographical constraints, it is extremely essential to make the communication media easily accessible to the general public. In spite of the establishment of the basic communication infrastructure in the country as of date, there is still an evident need to continue rendering the communication media more sustainable, reliable and easily accessible in the face of the development of the fast evolving, new and ultra-modern communication technologies in the world. Although, compared to the situation four decades ago, there has been a significant development in this sector; it still lags far behind the growing needs and demand of the people. While the demand for communication services is\\' steadily increasing in consonance with development requirements, the shortfall in the means and resources pose a serious barrie r. Therefore, in spite of the limited investment potential of the country, it has been incumbent upon the nation to pay, due attention to the befitting development of this sector. In the given circumstances, while it is essential to establish at least one post office in one Village Development Committee through a massive extension of the only economical and sustainable communication medium of postal services, it is important to reconcile the demand and supply situation of the telecommunication services in the urban sector. Television is no doubt a very effective medium of communication but till now its transmission is confined to a few urban areas only. In view of the profound impact the television transmission may have on the people, it needs to be extended to all areas having electricity supply. Similarly, necessary efforts should be continuously made towards the maintenance of quality standards and the strengthening of Radio Nepal broadcast. Besides, while efforts for the proper development of this sector should be continued. gradually making the entire sector of communication self reliant, unfailing attention needs to be paid to the development of printing technology, and journalism, the extension and consolidation of news and information services, the development of skilled manpower and the amelioration of the service standards. Objective: 1. To inspire the people to involve themselves in the task of national development by augmenting their level of awareness and making them aware of their rights and duties through their guaranteed right to information. 2. To develop and expand the communication sector as an important infrastructure for the overall development of the country. 3. To expand communication services so as to make them easily accessible to rural areas through the adoption of appropriate technologies. 4. To make the communication sector self-reliant from the economic and financial points of view. Policy special attention will be paid to develop telecommunication anti postal services to enhance trade, industry and tourism and to meet increasing communication requirements of the country. The existing telecommunication services will be further improved and expanded by adopting an appropriate technology in order to provide reliable, easily accessible and quality services both nationally as well as internationally. In the process, ISD and STD services will be provided to all district headquarters. Requirements of telecommunication services of industrial, commercial and urban subscribers will be met wherever feasible. In view of the government\\'s social obligations, rural telecommunication services, will be provided by adopting technology appropriate to the geographical features of the country. Along with the extension of postal service to the rural areas, it will be activated to provide monetary services such as postal savings arid money orders especially in rural areas. In addition, expedited mail services will be introduced. Necessary improvements will be made in order to deliver postal goods quickly and reliably . Necessary steps will be taken towards the establishment of a second channel in the medium wave by strengthening and expanding radio broadcasting services. steps will also be taken to initiate radio broadcasting through frequency modulation (FM) in the private sector. The coverage of television will be expanded through appropriate technology and its use in the educational sector will be enhanced. Royal Nepal Film Corporation will be made self reliant before taking necessary, steps to privatise it in the future. The Department of Press Information will be equipped with enough physical facilities to ensure an uninterrupted flow of information. Further, necessary incentives will be provided to the private sector to ensure the adequate flow of information to the public through the development of healthy journalism. The public sector communication media will be granted more autonomy. Due emphasis will be given to the development of manpower for enhancing the service standards of telecommunication, television, radio, and postal services and other agencies\\' under communication sector. Programmes: 1. Department of Postal Services Sett1ng Up of Post Offices In the coming five years, 400 Area-Post Offices and 1800 Additional Post offices will be set up in a bid to provide easy postal services to the general public. A minimum of one post office will be established within each Village Development Committee. Development of Mail Conveyance and Quality Standard Five new postal routes and internal expedited mail services in all the 36 municipalities will be extended in the process of making the postal services prompt and standard. In addition to this, the postal services will be improved through the procurement of mail vans, necessary machines and equipment. In the context of promoting the quality of services, 800 persons will be provided training and 10 seminars will be held within the plan period. A total of 15 buildings including three district post offices, 10 Area Post Offices, one training centre and one central stamps store will be constructed within the plan period in the process of strengthening the post offices physically. Four of these buildings will be constructed in the Eastern region, 5 in the Central region, and 2 each in the Western, Midwestern and Far-western regions.

Details of Expenditure A detail of expenditure to be incurred in the communication sector during the Eighth Plan period is given in the attached Appendix 1. Industry and Mining Introduction It is an indisputable fact that the development of the industrial sector plays an important role in the economic upliftment of the nation. As long as this sector can not be expanded on a promotional basis, proper development of the economy can not be possible. The main objective of the industrial development is to mobilise properly the labour, capital and the .natural resources, available in the country towards industrialisation. The economy is still dependent mainly upon agriculture in spite of the various efforts in the past. Though efforts were made in the past decade towards diversification and development of industry to some extent, it has not been possible to bring continuity in the growth rate of industrial production. The impact of industrialisation has been low in boosting the economy due to the growth of low value generating, inefficient and non-competitive industries in the country because of the control oriented policy and excessive protectionism adopted in the past. Besides, there are clear indications that export oriented industries can not develop to the desired level as long as protection is extended to the import substitution industries. Satisfactory progress has not been achieved in most of the production oriented public corporations. As a result, the investment has become unproductive on the one hand; and there has been adverse effect on the participation of the private sector on the other. The contribution of this sector in the economy has still been minimal because of the failure to develop it in a sustainable manner due to policy distortions in the past. While the administrative control, the complicated licensing and registration procedures and the unwarranted delays etc. have discouraged the private investment in this sector, it has not been possible to attract the foreign investment as expected due to the excessive control and the lack of transparency in the system. In this context, it has become essential to inter-coordinate the economic policies and strengthen the implementation process with the elimination of policy distortions of the past in order to enhance the contribution of the industry sector in the national economy. Progress during the Seventh Plan Preparation of medium and long term industrial plan, formulation and implementation of Industrial Enterprises Act 1987 , consolidation of industrial statistics, organisational reforms of the ministry and departments etc. can be taken as some of the achievements worth mentioning accomplished during this Plan period. Similarly, the small industry sector products, especially the readymade garments and woolen carpets, have made significant contribution to foreign currency earnings through their increased export. The production of certain industrial commodities declined due to inadequate supply of raw materials and the primary commodities during the last two years pf the Seventh plan period. The growth in the production of biscuits, textiles, jute materials, plywood, iron rods and angles, steel utensils, agricultural equipment, G.I.H.B.- cable, is seen-to have declined. until the end of Seventh Plan period, while much growth was observed in the products like vegetable ghee, noodles, biscuits and animal feed, liquor, beer, soft drinks, cigarettes, P.V.C. slippers, detergent soap and powder, paints, rosin and turpentine, polythene pipe, and other plastic materials, due success was achieved in gaining foreign exchange by exporting the garments and the woollen carpets to a remarkable extent. Certain degree of progress has been noticed in the expansion of industrial estates in Patan, Pokhara, Dhankuta and Surkhet, but minimal progress is observed in Dharan, Butwal, Nepalganj and Bhaktapur.Of the proposed industrial estates in Dhangadhi, Rajbiraj, Panchkhal and Ghorahi, only Rajbiraj indu_trial estate is being constructed under the Indian assistance, whereas the construction of others have not even started. Feasibility studies have been conducted to establish industrial estates in Nuwakot, Jhapa and Lamahi (Dang). The average capacity of the industries operated by public sector during Seventh Plan period is only 64.8 percent. While that of Birgunj Sugar Mills and Janakpur Cigarettes Factory were found to have exceeded their targets, the industries like Harisiddhi Bricks and Tiles Factory, Bhaktapur Bricks Factory, Hide Collection and Development Corporation, Hetauda Textile Industry, Royal Drugs Ltd., Raghupati Jute Mills, and Balaju Textile Industry have been found to have produced much less than the targeted amo unt. -The production of Himal Cement Factory, Hetauda Cement Factory and Nepal Orind Magnesite have been quite lower than were set in their respective targets. In this Plan period,. the construction works of Bhrikuti Paper Factory, Lumbini Sugar Mills were completed, but the works of Butwal Spinning Mills and Udaypur Cement Factory have been only partially completed. Realizing the fact that most of the public sector industries have not been able to function in a commercially vi-able way as expected, they were aimed to be privatized; but no progress was made in this regard. out of 23 public sector industries reviewed for their financial status, only 7 were found to have run in profit and the rest in loss. No satisfactory improvement has been experienced in most of the public sector industries even in terms of labour and personnel productivity. Industrial planning and monitoring systems were initiated in the Seventh Plan in order to conduct a( detailed study of the positions of the existing industries within the country in a planned way, to collect reliable and the latest data of the productive industries, to undertake regular supervision and evaluations of the industries in order to see that the facilities made available to them are not misused. Qualities of 200 items were determined within the Plan period with the aim to improve the standards of the goods produced within the country. In the same way, works were undertaken in connection with the formulation of rules and regulations with regard to the determination of quality to protect the interest of consumers, training the people for skill-development, providing the technical and advisory services and with the granting of quality control symbol to ten products. The Hide Collection and Development Corporation made a notable progress within the plan period in collecting and preserving the raw hides in order to provide raw materials to -the indigenous industries. In the field of mineral exploration, works conducted under the petroleum exploration project within the Plan period were 3580 Km. of seismic survey, 3000 metre deep hole drilling, measures of 600 Km. geological section and 800 petro-chemical samplings. Investigation works have begun in Kakuwa of Sankhuwasabha district for the investigation of lead in that area. Under the mineral exploration proj_ct, studies related to phosphorite were conducted in Baitadi, Bajnang districts and lime\" stone investigation in 65 hectares in Dhankuta was completed during the same period. In the same way, under the coal exploration programme, though the target was to have detailed investigation in Kathmandu Valley, the available coal being of low quality and in extensively scattered state,no detaile9 works were conducted. Under the regional geological and mineral survey the coloured geological map in 1:250,000 scales of \" the southern and central Nepal, black and white geological map in 1:50,000 scales of the east and geological map in 1:1,000,000 scale of the kingdom as a whole were prepared. The study of 11,500 sq.km. area upto the Himalayan region in the north has also been completed. An intensive map in 1:5000,000 scales after surveying the aftermaths of earthquakes and other geological hazards of the earthquake affected districts of Udaypur and the adjoining districts, engineering geological maps of 264 hectares for Pashupati Development Area, and land-slide inventory and risk mapping of 3960 Km. have been prepared. Besides, pilot projects were launched by carrying out studies on the feasibility of industries, technical support to the industries, preparation and distribution of schemes and the survey of cottage industries. A profile was prepared by conducting seminars and visiting industries in course of publishing industrial statistics. Industrial products costing Rs66 million have been sold and equipment and the raw materials of Rs889\\'million have been made available by Cottage Industries and Handicrafts Emporium. The progress of the cottage industry during the Plan period appears to have been as follows. Total Capital Investment (Rs in Thousand) \\t21,33,75 Annual Production Capacity (Rs in -Thousand) \\t96,09,16 Employment \\t49,921 The industries related to rice, pulses, oil, flour and furniture are the major registered industries. Progress during Fiscal Years 1990/91 and 1991/92 The average growth rate of industrial products is about 23 percent for the years 1990/91 and 1991/92. This growth rate has been possible due to the industries having been operated to the optimum capa city with an adequate supply of raw materials and also due to some industries having begun their production. During these years the production capacities of sugar, bricks, tiles, cement, and jute industries increased while those of shoes and beer remained constant. In the same way, during the first nine months of the fiscal year 1991/92 the production of food stuff, detergent powders, cement, beer, battery, plastic items, jute items, increased as compared to the/ production of the previous years, but there was no such remarkable progress in the production of paper, soap, iron-rods, cigarette, ghee, and synthetic fabrics. During this period, altogether 1557 small, medium and large scale industries were registered requiring the investment of Rs5,530 million, whereas only 269 industries were actually permitted to be operated. Necessary policies, infrastructure and data-base for the industrial development, organizational consolidation and improvement processes were begun in this fiscal year. According to the government policy of privatization, necessary privatization policies were formulated and systematically implemented. Together with\\' the new industrial policies, foreign investment and one window policies were brought to the people towards the end of the fiscal year 1991/92. As such, excepting some limited numbers of industries, other industries were exempted from obtaining licence. Existing Problems The possibilities of economic development can be further strengthened only if the economy based on agriculture is developed through the process of industrialization by mobilizing labour, capital and the natural resources available in the country. It is necessary to take appropriate measures in order to avoid slackness and instability observed in the agricultural and industrial productions and also to intensify the promotion of production and employment. There is a need to promote the impacts of industrialization in consolidating the economy by improving and developing the industries which are able to raise the value added contents of the items produced and those which can compete in the national and international markets. For this, it is necessary to bring about a great degree of improvements in the policies to be adopted by the country on customs, trade, foreign exchange, industry and foreign investment. It is also highly imperative that the consolidation of .direct and indirect industrial infrastructure be made, along with the elimination of the procedural hurdles. It is necessary to involve the private sector actively in the industrialization along with the efforts of successful management of the policies and their implementation. Since the industrialization of a country is not possible only with efforts of the government without the participation of the private sector, and since long term industrial development is not possible without attracting the private sector investment which requires open market and sound competition, appropriate atmosphere needs to be created for drawing investments from the private sector. The public sector, industries which might discourage the private participation should be gradually handedover to the private sector itself. On this ground, the presently adopted industrial policy will be actively implemented. In a country like Nepalwhich is poor and constrained in natural resources too, industries can be developed only through setting up of industrial infrastructure by ways of taking appropriate measures to create suitable atmosphere for foreign investment and the transfer of technology. In this context, by the successful implementation of presently announced foreign investment and one window policies, the foreign investment will be channelled into the country and progress will be made in the import of technology, transfer of management and technological skills, development in the competitive business concepts, reaching out to the international markets and growth in the productivity, which are expected to make significant contribution to the development of efficient and competitive industries. There is a need to make our industrialization process dynamic and consolidated by developing and expanding cottage and small scale industries in keeping with our limited markets, level of technical know-how, position of transportation, and the geographical structure of the country. The industries of this very sector must be given top priority and be developed and expanded accordingly, within the Eighth Plan period for the reason that they will playa significant role in the balance of payments by substituting imports and bringing self dependency in the small but necessary items, consequently to contribute importantly in the overall economy of the country. Identifying these resources and bringing them to the commercial use will be highly significant in view of industrialization\\' and the economic development of the country. In this context, measures need to be taken for purposeful utilisation of these mineral resources by formulating appropriate policies and programmes in the Eighth Plan. Against this background, following objectives are set for the development of industry and the mines for the Eighth Plan. Objectives: 1. To generate extra income and employment by enhancing inter-relations between productions oriented industrial sector and other economic activities. 2. To develop this sector as an important means of earning foreign currency by improving the quality, productivity and the production of exportable items. 3. To promote medium and large size industries in order to substitute imports and also to fulfil internal demands by improving cottage and small scale industries using the locally available resources. 4. To build necessary infrastructure to identify the mineral resources which may be used commercially in the country. 5. To increase national-production by developing industries based on existing mineral reserve. Policies 1. The import substituting and export promoting industries will be developed on the basis of competitiveness in order to use comparative advantages in the country. In the same way, industries will be established, expanded and modernized on the basis of the capacity and the comparative advantage of the industries. . 2. Top priority will be given to private participation for the promotion and development of industries, and the existing policies relating to licence, foreign exchange, trade and taxes will be formulated, legalized and implemented ,in a more liberal and transparent way. Similarly, policies and guidelines will be formulated and effectively implemented with regard to the transfer of existing government sector industries and the industrial estate_ to the private sector. 3. Emphasis will be given to the development and expansion of cottage and small scale and agro based industries in order to generate the income and purchasing capacity of the people by increasing the opportunities for productive employment. 4. Foreign investment will be increased for the maximum utilization of managerial and technical s ills, modern technology, foreign capital in the process of promoting industries within the country itself. 5. Emphasis will be given to the improvement of technical skills and industrial capacity in order to improve the country I s competitiveness in the international markets by bringing about reforms in the quality of the industrial productions. 6. Environmental Pollution contr61 Act, rules, regulations and guidelines regarding it, will be formulated and then put to operation in order to minimize negative impacts of the establishment of industries, their expansion and diversification on environment. 7. A technical research and development policy will be prepared for the purpose of selecting, evaluating and monitoring the nationally viable technology to help the small scale industries in performing research and development activities. 8. Emphasis will be given on the modernization of industries equipped with old and unproductive machines, and the reinstallation and consolidation of sick industries. 9. Industrial estates will be established in various-places to build integrated infrastructures of the industries. 10. Industries having backward arid forward linkages with the large scale and other cottage industries will be developed in order to promote industries based on locally available raw materials. Necessary policy steps will be taken to encourage linkages between informal sector (cottage industry units and the organized sectors. 11. An export processing zone will be established and operated within the plan perl0od to promote the fully export oriented industries. Similarly, top priority and appropriate facilities will be given to the industries known to be of national importance. 13. Efforts will be made to maintain regional balance in industrialization by providing the financial help and facilities. 14. Growth in production and productivity will be furthered in the form of a campaign. 15. Additional incentives will be given to the industrialists who re-invest their profits from industries in ancillary industries of their own. 16. Institutional arrangements will be made to familiarize the cottage and small scale industries with market, technology, skills and the like. 17. Existing financial institutions will be strengthened to financially support the industrial sectors, and new financial institutions will be established to assist the cottage and small scale industries with financial arrangements. 18. Financial and capital markets will be developed by amending Security Exchange Act in order to ensure capital flow, necessary for industrial development. 19. Amendments will be suitably made in the Company Act and all relevant Acts in order to achieve extensive public participation in industrial development. 20. National and foreign investment and technology will be attracted to properly organize and conduct mineral exploration and development, as well as geological activities in a planned manner. 21. Various laboratories, technical and logistic services necessary for the mineral exploration and the development of such works will be properly managed. Sub-sectoral Policies From the Eighth Plan onwards, the sub-sectoral programmes, will be formulated and implemented by coordinating the industrial sector programmes with the extensive national Plan. Accordingly, activities will be divided \\'into five sub-sectors for implementation. In addition to the work policies mentioned above, following policies relating to sub-sectors will be followed in order to fulfil the above extensive objectives. Highly significant industrial products and those which may be produced with greater competitiveness and capacity within the country will be the basis of formulating such policies. Food, Beverages and Tobacco Sub-sector Appropriate priorities will be determined and programmes will be formulated and launched accordingly in view of the probable contributions of the industries of this subsector in \"economic development and national production. Proper modernisation policy measures will be taken upon their formulation to modernise traditional industries (rice, pulses and oil mills etc.) for achieving an increase in production and productivity and a reduction in production costs. Necessary arrangements will be made for the export of the products of high export-promotional value such as spices, processed fruits , mushrooms, noodles, animal feed, meat, tea and floriculture items etc. by according high priority in their production and processing. Joint efforts from the government and private sectors will be made for extensive improvements in the quality standards of the products of this subsector, and\\' the institutions providing research and development services to the small and cottage industries of the subsector will be\\' further consolidated. Textile and Garmentsubsector Equal protection will be given to -all text ile industries being operated within the country to make use of all kinds of raw materials and also to produce materials like yarn, clothes, thread and fabrics etc. These industries will be developed orienting _hem towards export as their products are exportable. A detailed plan will be formulated and put into operation in order to develop the garments and other industries, related to silk production and processing ,high quality carpet product1:onand high quality leather and leather goods production as export oriented industries. In the same way\\' programme will be launched to consolidate the sick jute mills. Chemical subsector Private sector, investment will be encouraged ,by enhancing the capacity and efficiency of these types of capital and technology intensive industries, keeping in mind that the industries in these subsector are mostly operated in government investment. In the same way, encouragement will be given to joint private-government and joint foreign-private sector investment in the potential industries which have not received sufficient private sectoral involvement. Appropriate measures will be taken to develop sound bases for the research and development and adaptation of foreign technology within the country for these industries as they will be highly technical and based on foreign imported materials. Mechanical Engineering subsector Necessary works will be carried out to\\' establish additional training institutions, together with the consolidation of existing ones in order to develop skill oriented manpower. A well facilitated engineering complex at the national level will be setup in order to technically support the small scale engineering industries. Electrical and Electronic subsector Encouragements will be given to foreign and private joint investments in these sub-sectoral industries which, though technology and capital intensive, are not efficiently being operating due to the lack of proper private sector participation. suitable programmes will be formulated and then put to operation with regard to the establishment. and the development of strong research and training institutions for the purpose of increasing , the technical effi6iency by developing efficient and skilled manpower. Targets and programmes 1. Industrial output It is estimated that the average growth rate of industrial output will be 12.4 percent in the Eighth Plan. According to this projected estimate, the annual growth in the value added will be 10.8 percent which will meant that the total value added of the productive industries by the end of the Plan period will be Rs 12,17 million at F.Y.1991/92 prices. The growth rate of industrial outputs like rosin, turpentine, medicine, papers, noodles, readymade garments, tobacco, cotton yarns, synthetic yarns, sugar, tea and poultry feeds till the end of the Plan period will be more than 20 percent as against the base year 1989/90. 2. Contributions to the National Production In the year 1991/92, the portion of industrial output was just 6.4 percent of the total national production at factor cost. It is estimated that the contribution of industrial sector will be 8.5 percent of the total national production on the, assumption that, t he total national production will increase by 4.8 percent by the end of the Eighth Five Year Plan period. 3. Export Promotion In the last year of the Eighth Plan goods worth Rs17,570 million produced from the production oriented industries are estimated to be exported. Among sub-sectors, export from the textile sub_sector will be highest costing Rs 15,630 million, whereas export from chemical subsector will be lowest worth Rs 790 million. 4. Employment Generation It is estimated that at the end of the Seventh Plan period about 2,14,000 employment situations were generated in the formal industrial sector, which was due to the industrial production and other programmes launched during that time. These figures are estimated to reach 395,000 with the creation of 181,000 additional employment situations by the last year of the Eighth Plan period. 5. Demand and supply of Manpower Although the manpower required for the industrial and mining sectors are to be supplied by the\\' technical training centres, Engineering Institute and various scholarships made available for the purpose, yet the supply of technical manpower is quite low, as against the employment positions for the manpower for administrative and managerial jobs. Basic level manpower is supplied by cottage and small-scale industries development centres, technical educational directorate etc. An industrial manpower and production council is planned to be organised in order to make industrial sector more efficient and productive by conducting activities related to the growth in productivity and the arrangement of able and efficient manpower. 6. Investment It has been estimated that around Rs 15,000 million on the basis of the constant price of 1991/92 will be invested in industrial and mining sectors within the Eighth Plan period. In this way, total of Rs 22,000 million at current prices will be spent till the end of the plan period. 7. Foreign Investment The lack of necessary technical knowhow and the deficiency of resources are some of the major problems that hinder the process of economic development from acquiring momentum. Foreign investment should be encouraged to avoid these problems in a systematic and co-ordinated manner. In this respect a liberal, timely, transparent and sustainable policy to attract foreign investment has already been announced after duly realizing the effective role to be played by the foreign investment in the efforts to develop the economy of the country like Nepal. It is believed that after the implementation of this policy the capital, modern technology, managerial and technical skills, access to the international markets, and the development of commercial attributes such as competitive commercial attitudes, awareness for the growth in productivity etc. will be channelled into the country. By the implementation of this policy it is estimated that Rs 2,430 millio n of foreign and joint investments will be mobilized to promote and launch about 200 foreign invested capital and technology intensive and export oriented projects with the aim to facilitate the foreign investors with necessary information and opportunities for investment, an investors\\' forum will also be organized. 8. Projects Most of the projects now running under the industrial sector will be continued to be operated. Projects relating to Small Scale Business Promotion, export processing, petroleum exploration, TRUGA ceramics promotion operated under foreign assistance will be continued to be operated. Following are the objectives and the programmes of the projects to be introduced during the Eighth Plan period. a. Small Business\\' Promotion project This project, centred in the development of entrepreneurships, and the promotion of small business has an objective to meet the target of providing entrepreneurship development training to 1725 people, training on monitoring system Ito 1515, training for trainers to 75,instructors, counselling training to 120 consultants an9 industrial consultancy services to 2600 industries, during this plan period. b. Industrial Planning and monitoring project The targets to be achieved under this project during the Eighth Plan are: preparation of managerial study report of 5 industries under industrial management, study of 5 sub sectors under energy management study of privatization, study of the effects of the industrial policies, and launching and supervising of industrial communication system. Under this project, which is to be established in Kathmandu, preparations such as the acquisition of land, site survey, design layout etc. will be made to establish and operate the export processing zone equipped with all necessary infrastructure. d. \\tTechnology Transfer and Development project The target under this project for the Eighth Plan is to establish Technology Transfer and Development Centre to collect and publish statistics related to technology development and transfer, and to technically assist in the selection, evaluation and replication of suitable technology. e. \\tIndustrial Survey and Study Project This project set up under the Department of Industries, for the collection and dissemination of industrial information, will accomplish 10 industrial feasibility studies, publication of 5 preparation and publication of 5 industrial statistics within the plan period. In order to produce skilled manpower within the Eighth Plan period, this unit has the target to provide training in leather goods production and the development of shoe-designing. Besides, it aims to construct a slaughter house. g. \\tNepal Standardization Co-ordination unit The targets set by this project run under Nepal Bureau of Standards and Metrology to be completed within this plan period are: to construct 9 central level laboratory buildings, to link 36 different measuring instruments with the national system, to make grade assessment of 15 industries at the company level, to collect and analyse quality standards of 1570 production samples and to prepare 370 standardization documents. h. \\tEnvironmental and Industrial Pollution In accordance with the system arranged in the new industrialization policy, a separate unit will be set up in the Ministry of Industry to prepare necessary policies, guidelines and standards in order to control industrial pollution and to observe diverse impacts of industrialization on environment. Likewise, Nepal Bureau of Standards and Metrology will prescribe the levels of industrial pollution and the effects of environmental pollution caused by industries will be monitored accordingly. Mines and Geological projects During the Eighth Plan, it is targeted to complete 300 line km. reconnaissance seismic survey, 2,000 line km seismic survey, 8,000 sq km gravel survey, 60_000 sq. km aeromagnetic surv ey, 500 sq.km geological section measurement and 500 petro -geo-chemical sampling. Besides, the programmes like 4000 m. drilling at Kathmandu for natural gas exploration, 2000 sq. mtr and 3000 sq. mtr survey in Dang and Surkhet respectively for coal and 5 t hermal spring site exploration in Myagdi, Jomsom and Sindhupalchowk will be launched within the plan period. 1. Geological Survey With the objective of identifying feasible minerals, targets are set to implement programmes such as geophysical survey of 10,000 sq.km, photogeological survey of 11,000 sq.km and conducting field checks and compilation in the Western, Mid-west and Far-west development regions, engineering geologic_l studies of 20,000 sq.km. at Kathmandu.and Pokhara of Centrql and Western Development regions and the establishment of 12 seismic stations in Mid Western and Eastern Development Regions. 2. Mineral Exploration The activities are: primary gold exploration in 1.000 sq.km throughout the country, gold exploration in 32 sq.km. in Rolpa area, 40000 sq.km. mineral investigation in Ganesh Himal, Jumla, Pantola, Salimar areas, geo-chemical investigation in 16,000 sq.km. in Western and Far Western regions. To explore minerals in Dang, Salyan, Baitadi, Rasuwa and Dhading, the drilling of 1600 metres, mapping of 200 hectares, survey of 2500 sq.km. will be conducted. 3. Feasibility Study There is an aim to conduct feasibility studies in 5 different places at Kathmandu and Dang for the purpose of establishing industries. In the same way, seven different locations; namely Dhankuta, Dang, Katari, Panauti, Terai areas and Phulchowki, are identified for the promotion of mineral industries. 4. Technical, Logistic and Documentation of Information The aim of the Eighth Plan towards technical logistic services is to make available chemical, mineralogy, drafting, drilling, analysis, testing, documentation and publication services necessary for mineral exploration and geological surveys. In this regard, services will be made available by regularizing publication and by preparing geological and mineral feasibility maps, in order to make available the scientific, technical and economic statistics to the relevant consumers and the researchers. Cottage and Small Scale Industries 1. Department of Cottage and Small Scale Industries The total of 26,000 industries consisting of 25,000 cottage and 1,000 small scale industries will be registered in the Eighth Plan period. Similarly, there is a target to prepare 10 data profiles. The cottage and small scale industries are estimated to provide alternate employment to 300,000 people in the rural areas. More programmes like TRUGA run under this department with foreign assistance will be expanded and launched. Some additional agreements will be made for the extension of the project duration of cottage industry and the ceramic promotion projects targeted for women. 2. Cottage and Small Scale Industries Development Centre The targets set by this centre are to establish its offices in 48 districts and launch skill development trainings to the total of 14,550 people of 15 days to 1 year courses on various subject areas to 12,_000 people and entrepreneurship development trainings in other subjects to 2550 people. In the same way, programmes are set to provide technical assistance to 3,000 industries, to prepare 4500 project programmes, to provide consultancy services to 1500 industries and to supply with the seed capital to 750 workers. 3. Government sector Industries Physical Targets of the industries run under the government sector for the plan period, are given in Appendix-4. Of these, some of the industrial undertakings will be handed over to the private sector. Implementation Arrangements Programmes as above to be launched during the Eighth Plan period will be implemented by the departments, committees and the projects under the Ministry of Industries, but \\'certain other programmes will be run by the Ministry itself. The role of the Ministry will be basically confined to policy-making, co-ordinating and providing directions whereas the functions relating to other aspects will be conducted by the departments concerned. The programmes relating to petroleum exploration, exploration of other minerals and development projects will be conducted by the Department of Mines and Geology, whereas the others concerning cottage and small scale industries will be introduced by the proposed Department of Cottage and Small Scale Industries and Cottage and Small Scale Industry Development Centre. Those projects like Leather Industry Promotion Project, Industrial Planning and Monitoring Project, and Export Processing Zone project will be launched by the Ministry itself, and the Small Business Promotion Project will also be conducted by the Ministry as a separate project. Other foreign assisted projects like ceramics promotion project, TRUGA, Karnali-Bheri Integrated Rural Development project, seismological networks will be implemented by the concerned departments. Public Corporations and enterprises of industrial sector will be gradually privatized on the basis of productivity and efficiency. Towards this end, necessary process will be initiated by the technical committee formed under the direction of privatization commission. The implementation and the monitoring works of the industrial policies and facilities, for the total development of the industrial sector, will be operated by the Ministry of Industry and the Industrial Promotion Board with the co-operation and coordination of the concerned government agencies. Details of Expenditure Rs2,245 million is allocated for the programmes to be conducted \\'under the industrial sector. The detailed description and the regionwise allocations of the above appropriation are shown below: Trade In the early stage of economic development Nepal\\'s trade was limited to that with India and Tibet alone. During that period, the major exports from Nepal comprised rice, timber, herbs and medicinal plants and handicrafts and the major imported items were cloth, salt, medicines and kerosene oil. Since the development process was in its infancy, people\\'s needs of the daily necessity foods were limited and the construction and development works had not yet gained momentum. As a result, the list of goods to be imported was also quite limited. Under this scheme, raw jute was exported to a third country for the first time. The main reasons behind this were the inability to identify new exportable items and the lack of positive measures towards increasing the production of goods already being exported. With the continued increase in imports as compared to exports, there also appeared some distortions in the system itself. With the objective of promoting exports, a system of dual foreign exchange rates was introduced in 1977. I under this system, the American dollar as per the first rate was deemed equivalent to Rs 12 and as per the second rate Rs 16. Although there was now a difference of 25 percent between the two rates, the export trade instead of introducing new exportable items thrived on export of goods such as raw jute, leather, pulses and rice traditionally exported to neighbouring countries. To do away with such distortions some changes were brought about in the dual foreign exchange rates. Under the changed system, while the first rate was left untouched, in the second \\'rate the exchange rate of the Nepalese rupee was brought down from Rs 16 to the U.s. dollar to Rs 14. However, as the change in the, exchange rate earned com paratively less profit to exporters tha n in the past, no new items coul d find an entry into the export trade. As the second rate was applicable to trade with countries other than India, there thrived the trend of exporting raw jute/\\'leather, pulses and rice to third countries. The reasons behind the 9istortions in the system and failure to diversify the export trade in terms of exportable commodities in spite of the facility of dual exchange rate were the absence of programmes that would\" establish proper linkage between producers and exporters, the lack of efficiency and entrepreneurship in the trade sector and also the prevalence of inward looking economy in the neighbouring countries: Therefore, the dual rate system was abolished and a single exchange rate was introduced in 1981. As the change from a dual exchange rate to a single rate system was comparatively less profitable to the exporters and as no concrete steps were taken in the country towards increasing the production for export, the export trade remained negligible during that period. Although the government -introduced a special economic programme in F.Y.1981/82, the balance of payments situation recorded a negative trend. The destabilization of the production of jute, a traditionally exported item of Nepal, due to changes in international market prices, the creation of a situation entailing the import of food grains for domestic consumption, the discontinuation of the export of timber due to excessive deforestation, the lack of development of any new exportable items and a limited export of leather, car8ets, readymade garments and handicrafts led to the increased trade imbalance. In this perspective, a system was introduced to allow 10 percent cash subsidy on the FOB price of the exported goods to promote exports. Under the nine-point programme, the Export Commodity Development and Export Promotion Council was constituted under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister to undertake timely and appropriate steps to promote exports upon reviewing the development situation of exportable goods and the targets, as well as the programme and progress of export promotion activities. Under this programme, several activities were undertaken such as the facility of foreign currency exchange to industrial houses upto 15 percent of their foreign currency earnings from exports in under to import raw materials, auxiliary materials and capital goods required for the same industry, a token export tax of only one percent on exports to third countries and a revenue and sales tax refund on raw materials of the products exported overseas commensurate with the export quantity even to the industries previously specified as not eligible for that facility. Although these provisions were appropriate in the context of the then prevailing economy, no reduction is noticed in the rate of increase in trade deficit due to extremely weak implementation I aspects. In the same context, the imposition of excessive estrictions on import for reducing the trade deficit led to  situation where the necessary commodities also could not be imported in time due to a great difference between  the real value arid market value of import licence, which reduced the opportunities of profit to real importers. Furthermore, although the system of cash subsidy on exports to third countries showed an increase in the trade with third countries, it could not make any significant contribution to the promotion of export trade. Progress during the Seventh Plan (1985-1990) In the first year of the Seventh Plan, the Nepalese currency was devalued by 14.7 percent under the Structural Adjustment Programme in December, 1985. A system was then introduced in 1986 which permitted the export of all goods produced in Nepal without any licence except for the items with total ban and quantitative restrictions. Similarly, to- facilitate the import of essential goods, arrangements were made for import upon the classification of goods through an auction system. In order to promote the export import trade, warehouses were constructed as and where necessary in the border customs areas. However, as regards the increase in trade deficit, it continued to grow unabated in the Seventh Plan. While the first year of the plan showed a trade deficit of Rs 6,263.2 million, the deficit amount -reached Rs 13,166 million in the final year. In the last two years of the plan, the failure to sign new treaties upon the expiry of the Nepal-India Trade, Transit Treaties and an Agreement to Control Unauthorised Trade also led to the increase in foreign trade deficit. In order to diversify the commodities to third countries which were traditionally exported, to India, a system of cash subsidy of 5 to 35 percent on export-was introduced. However, this system also could not promote the export of commodities, with a few exceptions to the third countries. During this period, the import of 23 commodities along with a few essential commodities was permitted under the Open General Licence System. Thus, the difficulties in the export of Nepalese products to India, on the one hand, and simplified system of import from third countries, on the other, led to a continued steady increase in trade deficit during this period. During the Seventh Plan period, there had been some structural changes in the foreign trade of Nepal both in terms of country and commodity. In view of the country wise diversification of trade during the plan period, the trade with India continued to decline comparatively whereas with other countries it showed an increase. In respect of the volume of export, while the share of the traditional goods decreased, the processed items such as carpets and readymade garments gained prominence. Among these, there was a large percentage increase in the export ofw oollen carpets, readymade garments, leather and handicraft items (including silver jewellery}. However, not much diversification was attained in their export market. Although the import trade was increasing day by day, the import of primary products including raw materials amounted to only 28.7 percent of the total import of F.Y. 1989/90. The remaining 71.3 percent consisted of the import of processed or consumer goods. There was a considerable change in the composition of import in the Seventh Plan. With a sharp decline in the import from India, the third country import reached to 70 percent. While the traditional import of development and construction materials in addition to consumer goods from India reduced , they were now being imported from third countries. However, although the import declined, the trade deficit with India went on increasing as the value and the volume of import had multiplied and there had been a reduction in the export to India. The progress of the programmes conducted at the institutional level during the Seventh Plan are as follows: Trade Promotion Centre The Trade Promotion Centre, having identified exportable items, has undertaken studies of the various processes  and stages from production to the export level of some of the commodities such as tea, large cardamom, handicrafts, silver jewellery, silk, vegetab1e needs, rosin and turpentine, orchids and horticultural saplings etc. Similarly, studies have been conducted with a view to solving the problems noticed in the processing of large cardamom and the production of ginger. As regards the exploration of market overseas for the export of potentially exportable items, studies on market feasibility and the export situation of niger seeds to Western Europe, of boulders and gravel to India and Bangladesh, of silver jewellery, large cardamom, dried ginger and some essential oils to the U.S.A. and E.E.C. countries were conducted. Studies were carried out with regard to the development of and market extension for readymade garments, leather and leather goods, and silver jewellery. With a view to promoting export to Tibet, studies were undertaken on the trade situation and problems of the potential Nepalese export items to Tibet. Workshop seminars and trainings were organised on various subjects all over the country in order to stir up the export sector and exporters by acquainting them with policy matters pertaining to export and providing information on export mechanism, international market and trade. With the assistance of EEC the Stabex project was initiated at the central level. Through this project financial assistance was made available to leather industries as a compensation for the loss that had occurred to them in the course of exporting leather and leather goods to European countries. Export Service Centre The Export Service Centre under the patronage of Trade Promotion Centre undertook the ,tasks of the preparation of a product catalogue, conduction of workshop seminars, collection and research of designs, and the establishment of an exhibition centre etc. in respect of publicity and extension work during the plan period. Some other activities such as training (dyeing and weaving), market testing of products and the preparation of different shades of colours were also completed. Nepal Transit and Warehousing company Limited A warehouse of 2000 m. ton capacity is under construction at the border town of Biratnagar, initiated during the Seventh Plan, for the storage of goods in transit. Similarly, having acquired some rental land, a container yard of 226,992 sq. meters in the Haldiya dock zone and an office building and staff quarters in the Haldiya township have been built. In order to strengthen the transit information centre, some work was undertaken with regard to the installation of the computer facility and the means of communication such as telex. The task of collecting transit information thus seemed to be in progress. Progress during the Fiscal Year 1990/91 and 1991/92 Despite the trade impasse with India following the expiry of Nepal-India Trade, Transit Treaty and Agreement to Control Unauthorised Trade on March 23, 1989, arrangements were made for the reinstatement of status quo ante in trade relatio ns until the signing of a new treaty. Furthermore, against the previous provision (during the treaty period of exemption from basic customs\\' duty and quantitative restriction to Nepalese products-consisting of 80 percent Nepali and Indian raw materials for entry into India, a decision was reached to open the Indian market to Nepalese products with 65 percent Nepalese or Nepalese and Indian components. Besides, there used to be a total exemption from the quantitative restrictions or to the extent of only 50 percent of the customs duty as levied on. the import from most favour ed nations in unusual circumstances to the Nepalese industrial products consisting of Nepalese or Nepalese and Indian raw materials or services amounting to 50 percent of the factory cost upon assessing\\' them separately. Subsequent to the formation of the elected government, three separate treaties on trade, transit and unauthorised trade have been signed between Nepal and India. The accessibility of Indian market to Nepalese products has been made convenient as under the new agreement the exemption from - basic customs duty and quantitative restriction has been granted to Nepalese products consisting of 55 percent Nepalese or Nepalese and Indian raw materials. Similarly, the provisions that a Performa once approved would remain valid for four years and the investigation with regard to a Performa would be completed within four months are expected to go a long way in helping the exporter to increase their export to India. During this period, a system was introduced to return to the exporters the premium previously charged on the import of wool used by them for manufacturing the. exported carpets. Similarly, improvements were made upon review in the auction system. In order to cut down the transportation cost in the course of export and import of goods, the documentation procedures at Calcutta Port were simplified and a warehouse exclusively for transit purpose was constructed in the customs area at Biratnagar. In the course of facilitating counselling and information services as requested by exporters and importers, the use of computers was introduced in these services. As an alternative to the \\'personal belongings\\' import system, a separate licence auction system was introduced for the import of merchandise by small traders. Similarly, the licence system for the export of readymade garments was revoked. The amount of money allowed for the import of goods was also raised in view of the possible fluctuation in the exchange rates and the supply and demand of imported goods. Thus, in consequence of the devaluation of the Indian currency against the foreign currency, Nepal also devalued its currency by 22.2 percent in the foreign currency exchange rates in F.Y. 1991/92. Similarly, arrangements have been made for granting permission to individuals for the import of goods for personal use upon the receipt of an application to that effect a the Department of Commerce along with the evidence of having opened an account in convertible foreign currency in any commercial bank in the Kingdom of Nepal and having sold a certain amount to Nepal Rashtra Bank at the approved rate. 1989/90 figures, the export and import trade increased by 45.2 and 31.5 percent in 1990/91 reaching Rs 7603.7 million and Rs 24,197.9 million respectively. According to these figures, the export trade amounted to 28.4 percent of import in 1989/90, which increased to 31.4 percent in 1990/91. This increase in export directly contributed. to decrease the trade deficit. Whereas export and import in the first nine months of 1990/91 increased by 45.4 percent and 28.6 percent respectively, they recorded increase of 79.9 and 38.4 percentages in the same period of time in 1991/92 reaching Rs 9,880 million and Rs 23,365.7 million respectively. Thus, an accelerated increase in export retarded the growth in trade deficit. However, even during this period, the trade deficit did continue showing a rising trend on the whole. While the trade deficit in 1990/91 stood at Rs 16,607.6 million, it is estimated to have reached Rs 19,247.4 million in 1991/92. However, the accelerated increase in export and proper import management have contributed to slacken the \\' pace of increase in trade deficit. Compared to the final year, of the Seventh Plan the trade deficit in 1990/91 increased by\\'26 percent whereas against the same year the deficit in 1991/92 is\\' expected to have increased by 16 percent only. The policies adopted in the trade sector in the past could not make a direct positive impact on the extension of trade and economic growth but created further distortions and problems. With the objective of doing away with these lapses in policy matters and in view of the emergent openness in the world economy, His Majesty\\'s Government has introduced partial convertibility of the Nepalese currency in current account in the course of transforming the Nepalese economy to an open, transparent and market-oriented one. In keeping with this new system, 35 percent of the foreign currency earnings from any trade or service need to be deposited with the Nepal Rashtra Bank at the government rate whereas the remaining 65 percent can be sold to any commercial bank at an \\'exchange rate determined by the market system. At the same time, it allows a foreign currency earner to open a foreign currency account by depositing 20 percent of his earnings in foreign cu rrency for the promotion of trade and T ourism. This policy measure has been undertaken by the elected government with the objective of providing a new dimension to the structure and direction of Nepalese economy in the perspective of developing trade into an efficient and effective sector and adopting a healthy and sustainable economic growth through policy reforms in the economy. A study of the preliminary indicators of the first three months following the implementation of the\\' above policyindicates that while there is great like, likelihood of export to have gone up, the foreignc\\ti urrency reserve has definitely ncreased. A positive impact of this development has been noticed in the decline of the trade deficit. In this context, a new trade policy has been\\' promulgated with a view to adopting an open and liberal policy upon reviewin g the prevalent export and import policies. Existing Problems 1. There has been a tremendous increase in trade deficit. 1991/92 alone, Nepal, as it appears, will have to bear a trade deficit of Rs 19,000 million. 2. The export base of Nepal has narrowed down due to the decline in the production and surplus quantities of traditional products. 3. There has been a predominance of a limited number of products (Woolen carpets, readymade garments, handicrafts and leather) in export to a limited market. Among these products, too, while the quality standards of woolen carpets have not ameliorated and at the same time the industrial base of readymade garments has not acquired stability. Due to the lack of productwise and countrywise diversification of these items, problems have cropped up with regard to their sustainability. 4. Although the deficit in trade with third countries is on the decline, the trade deficit with India has been rising due to an excessive increase in import and stagnation in export. 5. Potentially exportable products, although identified to a certain extent have not yet been efficiently selected and developed. 6. The erroneous policies adopted in the past have hindered the healthy development of trade. While this has caused only a limited growth in export on the one hand, the lack of proper import management, on the other, has led to various distortions and anomalies in the economy. At the same time many products with export potential have not found an entry into the export sector due to the lack of transport facilities and- other basic infrastructures. 8. Proper backward and forward linkages are not yet fully established for the promotion of sustainable export trade. Background of the Eighth Plan The trade sector has an extremely significant role in accelerating the growth rate of economy. The inward or outward looking policies and programmes adopted with reference to international trade promotion clearly reflect  the philosophy of development of a country and the contribution of its trade sector in the economy. The failure of certain nations to achieve the desired pace of development due to their inward looking policies has been clearly noticed. In Nepal also, the economic policies of the past nearly stagnated the pace of development and the inward looking policies adopted in the trade sector led to the increase in trade deficit. Consequently, the trade, sector could not make desirable contribution to the economy due to the lack of appropriate policies and their satisfactory implementation as well as the inadequacy of production and diversification of exportable commodities. As the extensive changes in the structure and outlook of _he world economy and the commensurate developments that have nearly established the indispensability of the market -oriented economy and out-ward\\' looking policies, the neighbouring countries, too, are heading towards competitive, market -oriented economy. The fact that the countries with open, competitive and market-oriented economies have achieved greater acceleration in the pace of development than the countries with control-oriented economies has been clearly demonstrated in the international scenario. In keeping with the formation of the government accountable to the people in Nepal and its commitment to eliminating the negative influences of the erroneous policies of the past in the economy, commensurable programmes will be implemented during the Eighth Plan to promote trade through the medium of competitive, market-oriented economy. The Eighth Plan aims at making the trade sector fully competitive and market oriented within the plan period. Therefore, in view of the experience of the past that any trade programmes introduced without reconciling them with the productive sector of the nation as a whole can not have a positive impact on trade, the programmes in the Eighth Plan have been formulated with a collective approach. In the course of making the foreign trade more open, transparent and simplified, the trade sector has been reconciled with the taxation policy, revenue policy, the policies pertaining to public enterprises and the policy of privatization. Similarly, a policy has been adopted to make rational efforts for the growth of production of exportable commodities only upon establishing direct interrelationships\\' witho\\tther production sectors of the economy such as industry, agriculture  and forestry. Aga inst this background, certain corrective policy measures have already been taken to provide an appropriate direction to the trade sector even before the implementation of the Eighth Plan and a compatible trade policy also has been implemented. Objectives 1. To achieve robust and dynamic growth in the trade sector so that it can directly contribute to the national economy through the creation of more income and employment opportunities. 2. To attain a favourable balance of payment situation by increasing exports and thus earn more foreign exchange. 3. To diversify international trade by promoting backward linkages for attaining reliability and sustainability in the export trade. 4. To expand trade making it sustainable so that the trade deficit can be minimized by gradually reconciling imports with exports. 5. To bring about qualitative and-quantitative enhancement in the supply of consumer goods for domestic consumption through a proper market system. 6. To expand employment -oriented trade in harmony with other economic sectors. 7. To make transit facilities efficient and cost effective in order to channel optimum benefit from foreign trade to the economy. Policies 1. During the plan period, the trade sector will be made more liberal, completive and market oriented in view of its role as a major contributing sector for the achievement of a higher rate of growth in the economy. 2. The private sector will be inspired to assume a major role in the trade sector, confining the, role of the government to that of a catalyst and a facilitator. 3. Liberal and dynamic trade policies will be adopted to attain a favourable balance of payments situation by increasing export for higher fore ign exchange earnings and by making the domestic supply system more qualitative and practical from the economic point of view. 4. A higher rate of growth will be achieved in the standard quality production of goods and services for  domestic consumption as well as export by ensuring the proper and efficient utilization of economic resources. 5. Special efforts will be made to increase productwise and countrywise trade. 6. Efforts will be made to promote the, interrelationships, among industry, trade and other economic sectors in order to boost national production for export promotion as well as domestic supply. Efforts will also be made to introduce and diffuse modern management/and production techniques so as to increase the production of exportable commodit ies through the introduction and development of new products and through the improvement in the-quality of existing exportable. 7. The State Trading Organizations being run in the governmental sector will be gradually privatized in commensurate with the performance and development of the private sector. 8. Appropriate monetary and fiscal policies will be adopted and necessary changes will be made to the foreign exchange policy to make\\' the Nepalese currency fully convertible for the above mentioned activities in the trade and service sectors. In addition) fundamental reforms will be effected in the administrative procedures so as to make them simpler, more transparent and dynamic. 9. The taxation system will be simplified and improved as necessary in order to maintain the spirit of competition in the trade sector. 10. Emphasis will be laid on the development of necessary institutional facilities and information network including the im provement in quality standards and monitoring system for the promotion of foreign trade. 11. For the promotion of international trade, the existing treaties and agreements with different countries and international agencies will be effectively implemented and more such treaties and agreements will be signed as necessary. 12. Necessary promotional programmes will be undertaken in order to augment the trade with neighbouring countries (India and the Tibetan autonomous region of China) and other SAARC nations. 13. Proper import management will be organized so as to create a competitive industrial and commercial atmosphere by utilizing import as a means of export promotion and development and to ensure the smooth supply of essential domestic commodities through the efficient mobilization of available resources from the economic point of view_ In this regard, with the objective of promoting competitive production, quantitative restriction on imports will be gradually phased out and replaced by tariff structures. 14. Various efforts will be made to improve the transportationsystem and to construct necessary warehousing facilities in order to gradually reduce the t1. In keeping with the above policies, various necessary arrangements will be made as follows: a. Monetary and Exchange Management 1. Arrangements have been made for an exporter to sell to commercial banks a specified percentage of his convertible foreign currency earnings from the export of goods and services at an exchange rate fixed by the market system and the remaining amount to Nepal Rastra Bank at the government rate. This has been introduced as a preparatory -measure for granting full convertibility to Nepalese currency in the trade and service sectors in order to create a competitive commercial atmosphere by reconciling exports with imports. Quantitative restriction and licensing system have been waived for the import of raw materials required by export-oriented and import-substituting industries. However, the foreign exchange required for the import of these materials will have to be obtained from commercial banks at the rate fixed by the market system. For trade promotion activities, an exporter is now permitted to open a foreign currency account with a certain percentage of his foreign currency -earnings. 2. Necessary arrangements will be made to make the Nepalese currency fully convertible in current account during the Eighth Plan period. In this regard, gradually increasing the present percentage of partial convertibility of the Nepalese currency, the entire foreign currency transaction for commercial and service activities including the business of the government will eventually be conducted at the market rate. Thus, once the full convertibility is introduced, all foreign exchange transactions will be-conducted by the market. 3. Pre and post-export credit facility will be made available on a priority basis in a convenient manner. b. Fiscal (Tax and Revenue) Management 1. The income from export is exempted from taxation and a tax holiday is also granted to the earnings from the export undertaken/on the basis of a letter of credit or any agreed banking document from India. 2. No exportable commodity in normal circumstances will be subjected to- any taxes other than service charges. 3. \\tf raw materials and intermediate goods required for the production of exportable commodities. In this context, regarding the import of raw materials, a total waiver or the storage facility in a bonded warehouse will be granted depending on the need and the nature of the import. The bonded warehouse facilities will be extended and improved commensurate with the nature of materials to be exported. 4. An Export Processing Zone will be established for the promotion of export. No taxes or duties will be levied on the raw materials or subordinate raw materials to be used by industries established in the Zone. Similarly, any other industry exporting more than 90 percent of its products also will be entitled to the facilities enjoyed by the industries of the Export Processing Zone. 5. The existing quantitative restriction on import will be gradually replaced by tariff structures and they will  be so adjusted that they do not affect the export -oriented and economically viable import substituting industries. c. \\tLicensing Arrangement A quantitative restriction may also be imposed, if required, on the export of any foodgrains in short supply in the country but such restriction on these commodities, too, will be gradually replaced for the export of any other items 2. In the course of liberalising the country import trade while the import of some commodities has been restricted and a few others require a licence to be obtained under the, auction system, the import of remaining goods has been left open. Under this arrangement, the import of industrial machinery- and services including the raw materials and consumables does not require any licence. Upon the introduction of full convertibility of the Nepalese currency within this plan period, the licence by auction system for goods to be imported for commercial purposes also will be cancel led and the entire imports will be left open. d. Procedural Management 1. The export valuation system will be gradually phased-out after the introduction of the full convertibility of the Nepalese currency. 2. The Nepalese diplomatic missions overseas will be mobilised for the promotion of export and trade agencies will be opened and developed on an institutional basis depending upon necessity. 3. No quantitative restrictions will be imposed on the exportable items to be carried out by tourists visiting Nepal. 4. Necessary amendments or reforms compatible with the present policies will be made to the relevant acts and regulations relating to export and import trade. The procedures and documents connected with export and import will be made simpler, shorter and more transparent. 5. With the objective of promoting export on the basis of the position and development of export activities, every year a pilot export plan and programme will be formulated with the co-operation of the private sector and export will be boosted accordingly. 6. Arrangement will be made for uninterrupted monitoring and supervision in order to efficiently conduct the export and import activities and to prevent the emergence of any distortions in this sector and any possible trade diversion. The basic structure required for this purpose will be formulated. e. \\tTransit, warehousing and Transportation Management 1. Studies of waterways and airways as alternative routes in addition to the existing ones will be conducted with a view to minimizing the transit and transportation costs. 2. Arrangement of air cargo at concessional rates for foreign trade will be explored. 3. Efforts will be made to have an appropriate place in Nepal linked with Calcutta Port with a broad gauge line in order to make the overseas export and import trade simpler and more cost effective. 4. A plan will be formulated and put into implementation to operate a container freight station to effectively extend the multimodel container transportation facility. 5. A two-way utilization of the means of transport will be achieved by reconciling export with import in order to cut down the transportat10n cost. 6. In addition to the construction of warehouses equipped with physical facilities in the border customs area for transit purposes, other basic facilities also will be built and consolidated. 7. \\tforwarding and undertaking service will be consolidated as an institution and mobilised more effectively to minimize the transit cost. f. Training and Manpower Management For the development of manpower required for trade and transit activities , training programmes will be developed and implemented in asso6iation with existing training institutes. g. Other Arrangements 1. For the promotion of export market for potential products, efforts will be made to mobilise the private sector and government sector to establish relations with foreign companies jointly or separately and conduct various programmes with joint investment relating to export market promotion. 2. Any producer selling his products in foreign currency to any project operating under a bilateral or multilateral assistance programme or selling his finished or semi processed products to the Export Processing Zone will be entitled to all facilities on his sale as on export. While the duty drawback scheme will be applicable to such sale, the income thus-generated will be exempted from income tax. Moreover, the foreign exchange earned in this manner can be disposed at the market rate upon making a specified percentage of the earnings available to Nepal Rashtra Bank at the government rate. 3. A conducive atmosphere will be created for proper management of the supply and distribution of imported goods and those produced within the country. In this connection, no restriction will be imposed on the transfer of such products from one place to the other for domestic trade. This provision will be applicable to the transfer of exportable commodities also. 4. The busines s firm registration and renewal procedures will be simplified. h. Organisational Management 1. A Board of Trade will be constituted und er the chairmanship of the Minister \"of Commerce with representatives from the concerned agencies of HMG and the private sector in order to efficiently organise the foreign trade, to solve the problems that may arise in the course of implementing the approved policies, to establish coordination among various agencies and to make necessary reforms timely and make commensurate decisions. 2. A Foreign Trade Policy and Research Institute will be established -a-s a technical wing of the Ministry of Commerce. 3. The existing Trade Promotion Centre will be reconstitut ed as Nepal Trade Promotion Organization to be jointly participated-by government and private sectors with a major share of representation from the privat e sector in order to facilitate the exchange of services and information in export promotion and import management and undertake other promotional activities. Targets and Programmes During the Eight h, Plan period-the average growth rate in export is t argeted to reach 19.1 percent whereas the import growth rate is estimated to be at an average of 11.7 percent only. Accordingly, the trade deficit of 15.2 percent of GDP in the first year of the plan is expected to record a decline reaching .13.5 percent in the final year of the plan. Thus, the average-rate of increase in the trade deficit during the plan period is estimated to be 4.1 percent. In keeping with the objective of continuously increasing the export of major commodities being exported at present , the export values of woolen carpets, readymade garments, pulses, leather and leather goods and handicrafts\\' (including silver and gold jewellery) are estimated to reach Rs 18,120 million, Rs 3,840 million, Rs 900 million, Rs 460 million and 280 million respectively in the final year of the plan compared to the corresponding export figures of Rs 6,430 million, Rs 2,940 million, Rs 860 million, Rs 240 million and Rs Thus, the annual export growth rates of those products are estimated to be 23.0 percent, 5.4 percent, 1.0 percent, 13.7 percent and 19.5 percent respectively. In the Eighth Plan, the trade sector programmes are formulated on the premise that the government will act as a coordinator and facilitator and provide necessary infrastructure and support while the private sector is entrusted with the entire responsibility of carrying out other activities and programmes.\\' a. Product Development and Export Market Promotion In order to increase exports, there is a need for the production of high quality commodities in accordance with the international demand and interest, which also implies the necessity of the identification and development of new products on the basis of the feasibility of production of available exportable commodities. It is equally, necessary to intensify the increase in exports to existing export markets, and to diversify the export market through the identification of new markets. Hence, the export base can be sustainably extended if stability and high quality are achieved in exportable commodities through quality amelioration and production growth of existing exportable product diversification in accordance with the demand of the export mar ket, import and development of modern production technology , maintenance of high quality standards in the production process, identification and development of new exportable exploration of l1ew markets other than the existing ones and emphasis on promotional activities in the targeted markets. Accordingly, with a view to establishing proper coordination between government agencies and the private sector and involving the private sector in the above mentioned activities to the maximum possible extent, attracting foreign inves tment in feasible sectors, various programmes relating to product development and export market promotion will be implemented during the Eighth Plan in the following manner: i. Consolidation of the Production and export of major products being exported at present Various programmes will be implemented relat ing to the product diversification and the enhancement of quality standards of existing export commodities such as woolen carpets, readymade garments, leat her and leather goods, handicrafts and jewellery, lentil and spices (dry ginger, large cardamom); the extension of sheep farming for increased production of raw materials to substitute export; the development of textile industries through the attainment of increased production in cotton crops; the promotion of foreign and joint investment; import and development of modern technologies; changes in pro duction technology; and the promotion of new export markets. Various programmes will be implemented to attain diversification in the use, design, patterns and -colours of suitable raw wool for maintaining high quality standards, to develop specified production areas for minimizing the effect of carpet washing on environment, to promote export to new markets such as t he U.S.A., Australia and Japan and to develop proper sheep farming management so as to reduce the import component in the supply of wool and augment the value added, simultaneously promoting the leather industry. Programmes aimed at the extension of cotton farming and the establishment of textile mils for substituting the import of fabric is raw materials, the establishment of large units to produce fashionable garments and the promotion of other markets besides the U.S.A., such as Japan, Australia and European Countries will be conducted. For these activities, emphasis will be given to foreign investment and the import of technology also will be undertaken. Leather and Leather Goods Programmes designed to increase the collection of leather through necessary arrangements for better sheep and goat farming, to extend organized slaughter houses, to impart and develop appropriate technology for the manufacture of high quality leather goods and to promote foreign investment will be implemented. Emphasis will be given on the increased production of traditional handicraft items; simplified and regularised import as well as supply of necessary raw materials; product adaptation and diversification of new products in accordance with the demands of the market; and the introduction of modern designs, in addition to traditional Nepali designs in the production of gold and silver jewellery: As, there also exists a demand for handicrafts in India, mark et promotional activities will be conducted there, too. Foreign participation also will be encouraged in this sector as necessary in order to adopt modernity in the production technology. In view of the great demand for lentil in the export market, arrangements will be made for the extension of the production area, improved seeds and the development of technology for the growth in production. Ginger, Dried Ginger and Large Cardamom Various programmes will be conducted relating to the development of new production technology for the production of less fibrous ginger through the use of high quality stock for the export promotion of this product used in spices; the development of a technology for the retention of natural colour in, ginger and large cardamom through necessary improvements in the drying process, product diversification through the production of dry ginger powder, large cardamom powder and oil (ginger oleoresin); and the promotion of market in South-East and Far -East Asian Countries in addition to India and Pakistan. 2. Development and Export Promotion of New Products Upon implementing programmes for the development of necessary basic infrastructure for developing the identified and partially developed exportable commodities such as tea, vegetable seeds, cut flowers and orchids, silk and allied products and essential oils into fully exportable products, appropriate act ivities will be undertaken for the market promotion of these products. In view of the demand for orthodox tea (leaf tea) especially in the European markets, emphasis will be given on the implementation o£ the programmes designed to incrrease its production. In the context of tea being exported in a limited quantity to Germany, efforts will be made for market promotion in Italy, France and Australia including Germany, too. In addition to expanding the production area for such seeds, necessary technologies will be employed to boost production, to maintain quality standards for edible certification and to arrange proper storage and packaging. A programme will be formulated to provide land on rent or lease for the exp ansion of production area. Moreover, experimental programmes will be undertaken in the export of green vegetables. cut Flowers and Orchids There is an abundance of special kinds of flowers and orchids in Nepal because of its diverse land-topographical structures and different kinds of forests and regions and there exists a great possibility of producing these items for commercial purposes, too. For the export of these products, basic structures (cold storage, quality standard certification etc.) will be established at export points in view of their extreme sensitivity and short product life. These products will be developed through the use of improve seeds and technology in addition to providing. land on lease or rent for production. Market promotion activities will be specially concentrated in the Gulf countries and European nations in view of the great demand for flowers and orchids in those countries. silk and its products Special programmes will be implemented to increase the production and production area of silk, whose production is bei8g carried out at a preliminary stage in a limited quantity in limited areas. Necessary programmes will be implemented by formulating them for the production and export of-silk products through the import and development of modern technology, and \\':oreigl1 investors will be encouraged to invest for the development of this sector. 3. Identification and Development of New Potentially Exportable Products: Efforts will be made for the production and development of new, potentially exportable but not yet fully developed products such as mushroom, saffron, computer software, coffee and others upon identifying the products and conducting necessary studies and surveys. 4. Development of Quality standards, Packaging and production Technology: As it is necessary to augment the packaging process along with the maintenance of high quality standards through the import and development of modern production technologies to make the country\\'s available exportable products more competitive in the international markets, the government agencies will assist the private sector in augmenting quality standards from the production level to the export stage through relevant research and development activities. His Majesty\\'s Government will provide technology assistance and the services to the private sector in the establishment of quality standard development units in the production sectors. 5. Special Export Promotion Programme Special programmes wil l be launched to promote exports in the traditional export markets of India and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. Through the proper implementation of toe trade treaty with India, the export of industrial products and other commodities in great demand in India such as processed herbs and medicinal plants, oil seeds and other agro-based products in addition to traditionally exported items will be increased by enhancing their production. Furthermore, in the perspective of both India and Nepal heading towards open economy, efforts will be made to simplify the procedures to achieve unrestricted export entry for Nepalese products into India. Similarly, the barter trade being carried out with Tibet in traditional goods will be extended to include new industrial products, too. Programmes will be formulated and implemented to increase trade in foreign exchange by simplifying the procedures for the export of cement and day -to-day consumables (confectionary and beverages) etc and the import of raw wool and other necessary commodities from Tibet. Various programmes will be undertaken to boost the trade with SAARC nat10ns besides the countries mentioned above. Trade agreements will also be signed with other nations in addition to the countries with whom there already exist trade relations. Nepal will playa special role in the SAARC forum for the formulation and implementation of programmes aimed at promoting special trade with ASEAN and EEC countries and other economic associations. In this context, Nepal\\'s participation will be pro9ressively enhanced in the programmes of trade promotion and cooperation cond ucted by international agencies. b. Institutional Programme In order to efficiently implement the declared policies and programmes of the Eighth Plan, various agencies operating in the trade sector will perform the following activities: 1. Foreign Trade policy and Research Institute This institute will undertake constant supervision and monitoring of the implementation of trade policies, provide counselling and recommendations to the Ministry of Commerce and Board of Trade in solving the problems arising therein and conduct necessary research and studies with regard to the consolidation of the liberal trade position. This institute will undertake studies for product development and organise necessary training for foreign trade in association with Nepal Trade Promotion Organization. In the context of promoting export, the institute will assist His Majesty I s Government in signing treaties and agreements and amalgamating projects with international agencies and other nations and also in establishing coordination through the Ministry of Commerce and Board of Trade between private sectors and the government and non-government agencies related to agriculture industry, forestry, finance and banking. 2. Nepal Trade Promotion organization The organization will undertake studies and necessary action for the development of production technology and packaging in order to achieve high quality standards and increased value added of identified exportable products and transfer these technologies to the private sector through other concerned government agencies. This organization will be responsible for conducting various programmes relating to different aspects of export promotion such as identification and promotion of the market, meetings between exporters and importers, exchange of trade delegations, participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions and arrangements for hosting such fairs in the country, international prices of exportable goods, structure of the export market, the trade policy and regulations of the importing countries, and arrangement of other necessary trade services. At the same time, the organization will conduct studies on import management and provide necessary services. It will also be involved in leasing for and implementing assistance programmes and projects for export promotion and import management through international agencies. Under the Stabex project operating under this organization, Nepal has received the Stabex transfer amount in the form of grant assistance for three years as a compensation for the loss accrued to Nepal in the export of leather .and pulses for the period between 1986 and 1990. Various programmes will be implemented under this project during the Eighth Plan period in different areas such as the development of hide, technical training, modernization of industries and develop ment of technology, market promotion, assistance to low income groups and cottage industries, exhibition of leather and the establishment of testing centres as well as encouragement to commercial farming of lentil crops, improvements in processing and research. With a view to minimizing the transit costs, it is targeted to build warehousing facilities in the customs areas of Birgunj, Tatopani (Sindhupalchowk), Bhairahawa, Kakarbhitta, Dhangadhi and Tribhuvan International Airport. Similarly, a 1,000 m.ton capacity warehouse and an office building are targeted to be built in the contaIner yard of Haldiya Port, India. During the plan period, there is a target to acquire land and construct an office building for the head office and purchase land for residential quarters at Birgunj and Biratnagar. In order to minimize the transit cost through simple, reliable and cost effective transit system, the -Transit Inform ation Centre will be further strengthened and made more effective. It wil1ge equipped with necessary physical facilities to familiarize the concerned sectors with the transit \\'means and processes and to provide counselling and transit information services. At the same time, the warehouse clearing and undertaking service being operated by the company at present will be further extended and the forwarding service will be conducted in a more organized and effective manner. Implementation Arrangements As the competitive trade sector forms the focal point of the liberal and competitive market -oriented economy proposed by the Eighth Plan, the private sector will be mobilized to undertake entire commercial activities from production to export and import. The Ministry of Commerce and the Board of Trade will perform a coordinating role for the effective implementation of the stated policies and programmes and> the solution of contingent problems arising therein in association and coordination with other government agencies. Trade related research studies and promotional activities will be carried out by the Foreign Trade P olicy and Research Institute, operating as a technical wing of the Ministry of Commerce, and the Nepal Trade Promotion Organization to be organized jointly by government and private sectors. For \\tthe \\teffective \\timplementation \\tof  product development and production programmes necessary for export development, the Ministry of Commerce will coordinate with other government agencies to provide incentives, training and other necessary assistance to the private sector. Details of Expenditure During the plan period, Rs 278 million is allocated for the implementation of programmes in the trade sector. The details of the expenditure and the sources of financing are estimated to be as follows: Tourism Introduction Nepal has become a centre of attraction and is being developed as a tourist destination due to its unique natural beauty, world famous snow-peaks like Mt. Everest that identifies the country itself and various cultural specialties of its own. Although it has not been very long since Nepal was opened to foreign tourists, yet the tourists inflow rate to Nepal has been increasing day by day. In 1975, the number of tourists visiting Nepal reached 92,000, whereas the figure was just 6,179 in 1962. The growth rate during the decade 1980 and 1990 was not more than 75 percent on the average. In 1991, the total tourist inflow increased by 155 percent and reached upto 292,995. The number of Indian tourists arriving by air in the same year reached 92,506 which showed an increase by 5).8 percent over the previous year\\'s arrivals. Tourism industry has already established itself as a major industry to earn foreign currency. Foreign currency earned from this sector reached upto US $ 58,600,000 in 1990, whereas it was us $ 78,000 in 1962. The- contribution from the tourism industry in the GDP is about 3.7 percent at present. Most of the tourists coming to Nepal are from North America, West Europe, East Asia and neighbouring India. The average stay of these tourists is 12 days in Nepal and their average expense is US $ 27 per day. The Tourism Development Board formed in 1957 could be termed as the very first attempt towards organizational efforts made in the planned development of tourism, in Nepal. Subsequently, the Department of Tourism was established in 1959. Nepal Tourism Development Committee was organized in 1969, which prepared the Tourism Master Plan, 1972. Now, the Department of Tourism, Department of civil Aviations, Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC), Hotel Management and Tourism Training Centre and the Taragaon Development Committee have been put under the Ministry of Tourism. The development of air transport, being an extremely important means of transport to bring the tourists into Nepal, has been considered to be a great supplement to the development of tourism. The history of air transport in Nepal began from the landing of Dakota airplane at the Gauchar Airport in Kathmandu in 1949. Although in the beginning, works relating to civil aviation were conducted with the assistance of Indian technicians, after 1972 these works began to be performed by the Nepalese themselves. At present there are 43 airp0rts in Nepal, including/one international airport, and of/which 38 are under regular operation by RNAC. The development and expansion of air transport have hot only helped in increasing the international contacts, but also contributed to the national integrity by making transportation possible to and from the remote places of the Kingdom. It has been experienced that the international and domestic air transport systems have played a significant role in promoting tourism, trade and commerce, including in the times of emergency and natural calamities. Progress during the Seventh Plan The tourists inflow in Nepal had increased by 11.05 percent on the average during the first four years of the Seventh Plan (1984/851989/90), whereas it went down by 9.8 percent following - the deadlock due to the termination of trade and transit agreements between Nepal and India in 1989. The foreign exchange earning reached upto US $ 6,83,43,000 towards the final year of the plan period, which grew by 11.24 percent as compared to the average during the five year period of the plan. An average per tourist expenditure was us $ 320 (US $ 27 per day) during that time, and the average tourist stay was 11.68 days. An analytical study of these statistics shows that during that time also the average tourists, not the targeted higher standards tourists, were in majority. The progress achieved in this sector during the Plan period is recorded as follows: Works relating to drinking water and sanitary system of tourism information centre Kakadvitta, reconstruction of Kakani guest house, maintenance of Snow View Hotel at Pokhara, setting up of Tourism Information Centre at Jomsom in Mustang, and a mobile tourism police system in Kathmandu, have been initiated. Together with the publication of various publicity materials, tourism programmes have been conducted in the source countries under joint collaboration with semi-government and private sectors. g. \\tTaragaon Development Committee Work has been initiated to mobilize financial resources with the loan assistance of the Danish Government for the expansion of Hotel Village at Buddha, Kathmandu. In the same way, great support has been extended to the promotion of trade and tourism with the improvement of the levels of efficiency and facility of the airport upon the completion of the construction of international terminal building, operations building, and the control tower. Likewise, the other completed works include: reinstallation of the borrow area at the airport, meteorological forecasting building, water supply security and storehouses. A master plan has been prepared with design estimate of the supply of water and sewerage system together with that of runway at Nepalgunj airport in a way to expand physical facilities at the internal airports. Similarly, the construction of 5 terminal buildings, 5 control towers, 6 residential quarters for the personnel, 5 residential quarters for the police, 2 drinking water systems, 5 runway expansion and improvement works, 4 river control systems, one sewerage and one fencing work are completed. Extending point-to-point communication services to 5 airports including the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, air traffic control\\' services at 8 airports and Aerodrome Flight Information Services at .22 airports have been made available. Air traffic services have been improved with the div1sion of Kathmandu:Air Information Sector into Kathmandu and Nepalgunj sectors. k. \\tcommunication and Aviation support Communication and Aviation support terminal building in 31 airports have been furnished with equipment and are being operated. l. \\tCiyil Aviation Training 568 technicians have been prepared by conducting basic and refreshment trainings in communication, ATC, radio and fire fighting areas. Progress during the Fiscal Years 1990/91-1991/92 1. Previously restricted areas with high touristic potential like Mustang and Manasalu have been opened for trekking. 2.

Works under the communications services have been initiated to provide point to point communication and aerodrome flight information services at one additional aerodrome of remote hilly region. 12. Technical flight and landing procedures have been developed and implemented with the help of communications and aviation support equipment at Nepalgunj Airport to facilitate night services in order to augment the internal flight system. 13. Two fire extinguishing vehicles will be available by the end of this year under the French loan assistance of 3.5 million French Franc in order to avail the facility of 6 categories of fire fighting services at the Tribhuvan International Airport. 15. Aviation security system has been initiated by arranging necessary machines and equipment at Tribhuvan International Airport under Canadian assistance. 16. In order to improve international air transport system bi-lateral aviation agreements have been concluded with 12 countries, i.e. India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, China, United Kingdom, Singapore, Maldives, Brunei, Bhutan and Russia. Existing problems 1. Very limited spots are available for tourism and these spots are put under increasingly high pressure. 2. There is a shortage of infrastructure necessary for proper \\'development of existing as well as feasible tourist spots. 3. No attention has been focused on the promotion of environmental, cultural and religious properties while planning for the development of tourism. 4. There is a lack of appropriate programmes that would inspire tourists to a longer stay in Nepal incurring higher expenditure. 5. No effective implementation of the promotional works has been made for the development of tourism. 6. The services and capacity of international airlines which have a direct linkage with Nepal are insufficient. 7. Internal air services are limited and the services are not up to the required standard. In the same way, adequate infrastructures are yet to be completed for the development of air transport. 8. Until now it has not been possible to increase the tourist inflow all round the year. 9. Tourism sector has not been able to maintain close linkage with other economic sectors. 10. In totality, there exists a problem of the supply of necessary materials for the promotion of tourism. Also, there is a lack of appropriate policy, incentives, appropriate rules and regulations and their effective use. Background of the Eighth Plan The country abounds in beautiful natural scenes, challenging snow peaks for the courageous and the adventurous, and the rare, exquisite natural vistas for the explorers and the researchers. Tourism industry can be developed in a way to contribute substantially to the national economic development by effectively using these heritages without causing any adverse impact on them. For economic development and increased foreign currency earnings apart from the promotions of industry and trade in Nepal, the development of tourism sector as a service industry is indispensable. This industry appears to possess higher comparative advantages in view of its being one of the important industries to earn foreign currency without causing any adverse effect on environment and also being endowed. With the opportunity of using the existing geographical and culture heritage. Therefore, tourism industry should be promoted with higher priority. This industry can also playa significant role in the development of rural and mountainous areas of Nepal. This, being an employment oriented industry, can also be used to solve unemployment problems, if it is expanded to different additional areas of the country. Taking the above facts into consideration, HMG in the Eighth Plan period, will attract private and foreign investors to the tourism industry in order to bring about effectiveness in the promotion of tourism by developing infrastructures in new aoristically feasible places. In the same way, it will create a necessary atmosphere suitable for implementing the policies formulated with an eye on the apropriate participation of private sector, communities and non-governmental organisations. The fact that the tourism industry could not be developed to directly influence the strengthening of country\\'s economy in the past is evident from the problems noticed in this field. Therefore, substantial steps will be taken to resolve these problems by formulating policies under tourism sector, in the Eighth Plan period. His Majesty\\'s Government, having followed a liberal economic policy and having taken tourism industry a2 a major sector, will playa coordinating and supportive role in the form of a catalytic agent to mobilise the private sector in its development. Objectives 1. To earn larger amount of foreign currency by the development of tourism industry. 2. To keep on expanding the tourism activities to other places of the country in order\\' to ease the tourist pressure in a few limited areas. 3.

Expenditure Details Rs 3,719 million has been allocated in the Eighth Plan for programmes related to the tourism sector including civil aviation. Programmewise allocation of the expenditures and their sources of financing are estimated to be as follows: Education and Culture Introduction Recognizing the important role of education for all round development of the country efforts to promote educational development in the country had been made since 1951, Although the present educational system in the country has been guided by the National Education System Plan implemented in 1971, several reforms have been introduced in the education system since then to respond to changing needs. However, a balanced development of all aspects of education in line with as pirations of the people and needs of the country could not be achieved due to too frequent changes in the education system and lack of a firm commitment to declared policies. The elected government established after the reestablishment of the multi-party democratic system constituted the National Education commission to recommend reforms in the present education system so as to make it more accessible, effective, work oriented, and conducive to technological development on the basis of thorough study and analysis of all aspects of the education system such as educational policy and decision making, structure of educational administration, management of education, curriculum and textbooks. The commission has submitted its report containing recommendations for educational development in line with Nepal\\'s present changed context and aspirations of the people after conducting study and analysis of all aspects of the educational sector and considering suggestions given by the general public. The constitution of th e Kingdom of Nepal(1990) has, for the first time (in the constitutional history of Nepal) introduced provisions related to rights of the people in areas of education and culture. various policies intended to serve as guidelines for development of education and culture have been enunciated in the Directive Principles and Policies of the State contained in the constitution . Progress during the Seventh Plan a review of the progress of major programmes implemented in the Seventh Plan period is as follows. 1. School Education Total enrolment in the primary schools reached 2,788,644 in the last year of the Seventh Plan (1989/90) reflecting attainment of gross enrolment ratio of 107%. The proportion of girl students in total primary school enrolment was 36 percent. Secondary level education is interpreted here to include the lower secondary level as well in line with the decision in 1988/89 to consider the VI to X grade structure as secondary level education. The total number of students at the secondary level by the final year of the Seventh Plan was 708,663. The proportion of girl students in total secondary enrolment was 29%. The number of secondary schools and secondary teachers had reached 5,917 and 22,820 respectively in the final year of the Plan. During the plan period, a total of 280,450 adults were made literate. The achievement levels indicate the need for further expansion of the literacy programmes. The Seventh Plan had laid emphasis on qualitative improvements in education in order to maintain high educational standards. They included the improvement of curricula and textbooks, Provision of trained teachers, reforms in the supervision and examination systems, the creation of a competitive atmosphere in the education sector, establishment of model school of regional centers and arrangements for training and educational materials for upgrading the standard of teaching of Science, Mathema tics and English. However, within the plan period, the 150 hr. training was imparted to 11,554 persons and the in -service training to 394 teachers. Similarly, 2,239 teachers were trained through the Radio Education Teacher Training Programme and 988 teachers through the Women\\'s Education Project. Arrangements were made for the introduction of a new supervision system in order to conduct effective supervision of the schools. Various activities aimed at  raising quality of education and improvement of physical facilities of schools were carried out in various districts of Seti zone conversed by the Education for Rural Development under the Seti Project, and in Jhapa, Dhankuta, Tanahu, Kaski, Dang and Surkhet districts under the primary Education project. Activities conducted during the plan period under the primary Education project were the establishment of 76 Resources Centres, rehabilitation of 782 schools, distribution of educational materials, teacher training, supervision, and reform of the examination system. In the area of technical education a total of 642 students completed their training in the technical schools during the plan period. 2. Higher Education Various programmes with special emphasis on qualitative improvements in instruction have been carried out under Tribhuvan University for increasing the capacity of producing middle and high level manpower in the fields of agriculture, medicine, engineering and forestry in the country. The enrolment and production of trained persons in technical institutes during the plan period were as follows. 2.2 \\tMahendra Sanskrit University Mahendra Sanskrit University was established in the fiscal year 1986/87 with the objective of conducting teaching and research in Sanskrit along scientific and systematic lines, and to promote Sanskrit learning. The university has carried out teaching and research activities, edited rare and important hand written manuscripts and also conducted instruction on performance of religious rites. a total of 1931 students of Uttar Madhyama, Shastri and Acharya levels together completed their studies in the university during the plan period. 3. Archaeology Programmes relating to preservation and renovation of historical monuments located at the Durbar Square areas of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan as well as in different parts of the country were carried out. 1. School Education A total of 2,925,820 students were estimated to have been enrolled in 18,681 primary schools in the year 1990/91, and the number of teachers was 74,849 in that year. Similarly, in the year 1991/92, the primary enrolment is estimated to have reached 3,072,111; the number of primary schools added in the year was 934, and that of primary teachers added was 3,010. At the secondary education level (lower secondary and secondary together) it is estimated that a total of 817,407 students will have enrolled in 1991/92, the number of schools having reached 6,419 with 24,590 teachers. The number of adults made literate in the year 1990/91 was 35,000; in the year 1991/92, a total of 158,850 adults were estimated to have been made literate through MOEC and other government programmes and non-governmental programmes. Basic Teacher Training (150 Hours Package) was provided to 4359 primary school teachers in the year 1990/91. It is estimated that 4,970 primary teachers will have received the 150 Hours primary teacher training, and 1,800 primary teachers will have been trained through the Radio Education Teacher Training Programme in the Year 1991/92. In the field of vocational education, 201 students were trained by technical schools under the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training in the year 1990/91. It is estimated that 264 technical personnel would be produced by the technical schools in the year 1991/92. Actual enrolments in the Institutes and Faculties and Campuses under Tribhuvan University in the year 1990/91, and enrolment targets for the year 1991/92 were as follows: Under Mahendra University 792 students were provided higher education in Sanskrit, and similarly 165 persons were provided training in religious rites in the year 1990/91. It is estimated that 635 students would be enrolled in different levels of Sanskrit education in the year 1991/92 3. Preservation of Archaeological and Cultural Heritage Various activities aimed at preservation and renovation of archaeological, historical, religious sites and monuments and preservation and promotion of Nepalese history, culture and arts were carried out in the year 1990/91. In the year 1991/92, various activities including panauti area monuments preservation project are being carried out. Existing problems The following problems in the education sector are identified on the basis of analysis of achievements during the Seventh plan period and the present status of education. 1. The national goal of universalization of primary education by the year 2000 A.D. Requires significant increase in girls enrolment. The lack of progress in this direction stands as a serious problem. Similarly, in view if the fact that as many as 60% people are illiterate, the present efforts to raise the literacy rate are very inadequate. 2. There has been a significant quantitative progress in education; this has not been matched by progress in raising the quality of education. the education system has been unable to contribute to meeting the needs of the rural areas; consequently, the education system has failed to promote the real development of the country. The lack of relevance in education is still a problem. 3. The internal efficiency of school education is quite low. Because of the high drop-out and repetition rates, completion of primary education requires over 9 years on an average instead of the requisite period of 5 years. This has led to a tremendous wastage of scarce resources used in the education sector. 4. The financial burden of the government of supporting the education sector is increasing day by day. In this process, much resources are involved. For promoting education of qualitative standards, efforts of the government are not alone sufficient. 5. On the one hand, there has not been an effective extension in the training of teachers, who have important role in raising the quality of education and, on the other; it has not been possible to make the teachers responsible towards their duties. 6. The present constitution of the country has provided opportunity to individuals belonging to every group, region, and community to acquire education. Making special education programmes more extensive and effective is quite essential in order to provide education to the disabled persons affected by various handicaps, who form a significant group of people . 7. There is a lack of definite policies and regulations regarding the involvement of the private sector in the education sector. Consequently, the schools operated in the Private sector are predominantly influenced by commercial motives. 8. The teacher pupil ratio in technical education is just 1:7. This has caused the unit cost of technical education very high, making technical education expensive. 9. The pressure of admission in campuses has become problematic, due to the ever increasing number of students seeking enrolment in higher education. On the other hand, as the university has to bear heavy administrative expenditures, it has not been able to make investment in instructional and academic development activities to the desired extent. At the same time, there is a need to make earnest efforts to raise the quality of higher education. 10. A great deal of work still remains to be accomplished in appropriate preservation and renovation of monuments and sites included in the world heritage list and recognized as of international importance. At the same time not enough work has been done to promote language and dialects spoken in Nepal, and local culture. Background of the Eighth Plan In defining the objectives, targets and strategies in the Eighth Plan for the development of the education sector in keeping with the times, attention has been paid to the progress achieved in the education sector up to now, the current problems of the sector and the provisions relating to education and culture in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990. Special emphasis has to be laid during the Eight Plan period on the development and expansion of basic and primary education in view of the national goal of universalization of primary education, and the attainment of literacy rate of 67% by the year 2000 A.D. For this, it is necessary to give stress of increasing the number of trained teachers, improvement of physical facilities of the schools, curriculum development in keeping with the needs of  the country, provision of textbooks, and regular and effective supervision of schools. At the same time, necessary measures have to be taken to maximize the participation of people of disadvantaged areas, tribal groups and women in education. The government resources are inadequate to meet the growing demand and aspirations of the people for acquiring higher education. Thus, it seems necessary to extend university and campuses on the basis of people\\'s participation. At the same time, It is necessary to implement reform measures for promoting qualitative improvement in higher education. Against this background, and keeping in mind the main spirit of the Report of the National Education Commission, the objectives and policies of the Eighth Plan in the education sector have been determined. Objectives of Education. 1. To contribute towards the development of the inherent talents and personality of every individual. 2. To prepare citizens who are loyal to the nation and nationality, dedicated to the preservation of country\\'s sovereignty and independence, conscious of their rights and duties, and have high moral character. 3. To help each individual in preparing himself/herself for life in the modern world, and to promote socialization of the individuals. 4. To develop science and technology, knowledge, technical skills and competence needed for economic development of the country, and thereby prepare capable manpower needed for various national development areas. 5. To enhance the spirit of nationality and strengthen social unity by preserving and promoting the glorious national culture, arts, music, national languages and by promoting creativity and research. 6. To contribute to the conservation and proper utilization of the natural environment and national resources. 7. To help in the integration of communities and groups that have lagged behind in society in the national main stream. On the basis of the above mentioned national objectives, the following level – wise objectives of education have been determined. 1. The objective of primary education is to make students literate with the ability to read and write and do basic computations, and to develop the habits of healthy living. 2. The objective of secondary education is to prepare self dependent citizens with the feeling of dignity of labor, loyalty to nation and democracy, awareness of environmental protection, strong moral character, and respect for culture, and social values and norms and to prepare students with necessary knowledge and skills for higher secondary education. 3. The objective of higher secondary education is to prepare middle level manpower who are capable of contributing to all round development of the country, and also to prepare students with necessary knowledge required for studies at Bachelors level. 4. The Objective of higher education is to promote intellectual development of the students and to prepare capable manpower and competent citizens needed for the country\\'s development. Policy 1. Basic and primary education will be developed and expanded keeping in view the national commitment to universalize primary education, and raise literacy rate to 67% by the year 2000 A.D. 2. People\\'s participationwill be encouraged for the establishment and expansion of preprimary classes. 3. The feasibility of introducing compulsory primary education will be studied. In the event of free and compulsory primary education being found to be feasible, local bodies (District and village/municipality) will be provided with necessary authority to implement the free and compulsory education system. 4. The Basic and primary Education Project will be implemented in all districts of the country on a phased basis in order to promote primary school physical facilities and develop the quality of primary education. 5. Primary teacher training centers will be established in different parts of the country under the Primary Education Development Project in order to promote qualitative development of education by upgrading the performance level of the primary teachers. 6. Special emphasis will be placed on increasing the participation of girls in education. Special programmes such as the distribution of school uniforms, provision of scholarships, and awards to schools attaining high female enrolments will be extended in order to attract girls to be admitted into schools, and to develop the habit of regular school attendance without dropping out. The policy of giving priority to appointment of female teachers in primary schools will be pursued and the appointment of at least one female teacher in a primary school will be made mandatory. 7. Emphasis will be laid on raising the effectiveness of teaching through teacher training, curriculum development and introduction of improved textbooks. 8. Non-formal education programmes will be launched on campaign basis for promoting literacy in the country.

A policy has been adopted to provide preventive and primitive services at the doorsteps of the common people through the integrated primary Health Services. In spite of the efforts in the past, it has not been possible to reach the health level of the targeted people has not gone up either. It is a well- known fact that the rural people no not have access even to the general health facilities. In keeping with national and international commitments, the present government is committed to make health services accessible to all by 2000 A.D. For the fulfillment of these commitments, the National Health Policy 1991 has been formulated with the objective of providing effective health services at the local level Progress of the Seventh Plan In the Seventh plan period, various programmes were implemented in the health sector with the objective of producing healthy manpower, providing basic health services, increasing the average life expectancy, controlling the population, extending mother and child health services, and improving upon the malnutrition situation. The progress achieved during the seventh plan is as follows: 1. Basic Primary Health Service For providing minimum health facilities to the rural population, 675 health posts have been converted into Ilaka  level Health posts, with the objective of providing integrated primary health services on district wise basis. There was a target to establish 1,300 to 1,400 sub- health posts at the village Development committees but it could not be achieved due to the lack of people\\'s participation. For the purpose of taking general health services to the doorsteps of the common people 24,000 female community health volunteers have been engaged at the ward level. To make the health services more effective institutional arrangements have been made by establishing district public Health offices in all the 75 districts and a Regional Directorate in each of the 5 Development Regions. In the Seventh plan period, 13,24 and 8 (altogether 45) health post buildings were constructed respectively under the Rasuwa- Nuwakot, Sagarmatha and Koshi Hill projects. In consonance with the policy of providing integrated primary health services, the services rendered by Uni- purpose projects have been conducted through the Ilaka-level health posts. The services provided accordingly in the Seventh plan period were as follows. With the objective of minimizing the adverse effects of populations growth on the economic and social development of the country, permanent and temporary family planning services were provided to 223,832 and 1,452,588 couples (altogether 1,676,420 couples) respectively. D.P.T. Polio and B.C.G inoculation services have been provided to 1,931,546, 1,883,289 and 157,858 children respectively. Tetanus taxied injection has been given 8,844,682 times to girls and women of 14 to 49 years of age. On the tuberculosis prevention side preventive programmes have been launched in 50 districts in the Seventh plan period and cough samples from 207,797 suspects have been examined. on the leprosy control side, the multi-drug therapy services have been provided in 57 districts. In the nutrition sector, programmes have been implemented through hospitals, M.C.H clinics and health posts with the objective of boosting the nutrition status of pregnant and breast-feeding mothers and children. Moreover, multi- vitamin tablets and capsules, R.D.Sol, Kitchen garden seeds and educational materials have been distributed and health workers have been trained. 2. Curative Service programmes In the Seventh plan, a policy was adopted to provide curative services on the basis of referral system at the central, regional, zonal and district hospitals, but the policy did not materialize. No substantial progress has been achieved in developing Bir Hospital- by adding 200 more beds and by equipping it with specialist services into a central hospital. Nor was there any progress noticed in the expansion of physical and other facilities for Infectious Diseases Hospital (at Teku), Kanti Children\\'s Hospital, Indra Rajya Laxmi Maternity Hospital and Bhaktapur Hospital. These hospitals were able to conduct only their regulars services. The Seventh plan aimed at initiating on a phased basis the extension of regional hospitals in all the Development Regions except the Middle Development Region. Preliminary work was, therefore, started under the plan for developing pokhara and Ghop a, Dharan hospitals into regional hospitals and making provisions for physical facilities at Dipayal and Surkhet Hospitals. for raising the numbers of hospital beds and expanding facilities in the zonal hospitals in Biratnagar, Rajbiraj, Birgunj, Kanchanpur and Dang, construction of hospital and residential buildings are being carried on. In compliance with the policy of providing each district with a 15 bed hospital service, 15 districts have been provided, in the Seventh plan period, with district level hospitals. In Khotang and Rasuwa the construction of hospital buildings is nearing completion; in Dhading, Rkolpa and Mugu the construction is underway: and in Ramechhap, Humla, Kalikot and Dolpa the construction is in its preliminary phase. The Seventh plan aimed at raising the number of additional hospital beds over the kingdom to 985 by establishing new hospitals and providing more beds to the hospitals already existing hospitals. In line with the policy of rendering the medical system more effective through the referral system, a Medical division has been created under the Ministry of Health dur ing the Seventh plan period. As regards health labs 23 districts have been provided with district -level labs and 59 health posts have been equipped with primary-level lab services. At the same time, in the Central Health Laboratory Bio-Chemistry, Immunology and Virology have, as per the target, been opened under the Nursing Services Improvement programme, the work of keeping the personal records of nurses at the regional level has been initiated and 4383 traditional birth attendants have been trained at the local level. 3. The Ayurvedic Hospitals In the Seventh Plan period, 27 Ayurvedic hospitals have been established. By this the number of Ayurvedic hospitals has gone up to 155. Thirty-six Ayurvedic hospital buildings have been constructed, and 75 hospitals have been housed in their own buildings. In Dang, a hospital building is under construction. However, Singh Durbar Vaidyakhana has not been known to have made any notable progress. 4. Health Promotive Services Under the Goitre and Cretinism Eradication Project, sales and distribution of 45,340 Quintals of iodized salt, installation of iodization plants in 3 places, and construction of warehouses in 4 places have been completed, and 4302732 persons have been given iodine injection. Under the Blindness Prevention Programme, in the Seventh Plan period works relating to the control of zeropthalmia caused by Vitamin A deficiency, the strengthening of ophthalmologic departments of zonal hospitals, initiation of ophthalmology services in district hospitals, and the establishment of eye banks have been completed. At the same time, training camps and ocular health education programme have been conducted. In the Seventh Plan period, provisions were made for antirabies vaccines in hospitals and toxic drugs were distributed for the control of stray dogs. In addition to the completion of the studies related to Japanese encephalitis and kalazar, for controlling the diseases transmitted from animals and birds to man, anti-snake venom was provided to hospitals as required. In the field of environmental health, works such as training health workers in food preservation technology in 21 districts, helping the construction of toilets in health posts, and building sewerage drains in and around the infectious Diseases Hospital have been completed. Under the epidemiological Disease Information, Diagnosis and Control Programme in the Seventh Plan period, works like coding the statistical date obtained from health organizations according to the international system of disease taxonomy, publication of epidemiological bulletins, dispatch of medicines and teams of doctors to prevent the spread of epidemic diseases to district hospitals and public health branches have all been carried out. Under the drug management programme, works such as the enforcement of the Drug Manufacture and Distribution Code, formulation of the National Drug policy, and scrutinizing the medicines produced by 700 pharmaceutical companies and is suing licenses permitting their import have been completed. Besides, Works pertaining to the establishment of regional medical stores for a regular supply of medicines to health organizations and related to regular supplies of medicines and medical instruments and tools have been done. Progress during the Fiscal Years 1990- 91 and 1991-92 In the fiscal Years 1990-91 and 1991-92 that is to say, over the last 2 year various programmes related to basic health services, curative services, and health- promotive services were conducted. The progress achieved in these programmes is as follows. Under the primary health services, integrated health services have been provided through Ilaka-level health posts. Accordingly, under the family planning and mother and child health services, the number of couples using the family planning devices has been raised to 854,225 (estimated) and the numbers of pregnant and breast feeding mothers and of infants and children availing health service facilities have stood at 918, 251 an d 584,137 respectively, On the malaria eradication front, the malaria- affected area inhabited by a population of 720,000 has been sprayed with insecticides and upon the collection of blood samples, persons identified as malaria- afflicted have been given necessary treatment. Under the Expanded programme for Immunization, it is estimated that 1,135,013 infants and children will be provided D.P.T. polio, B.C.G and measles vaccines and 1,158,004 girls and women of 15 to 44 years of age with tetanus toxide injection. on the tuberculosis control side 5,532 tuberculines will be treated and on the leprosy control side, 1413 lepers will be provided multi-drug therapy services. Moreover, with the objective of reducing infant mortality rate, diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases control programmes as well as nutrition programmes are under implementation. In accordance with the health policy 1991, which aims at providing hospital- bed facility to primary health services and health institutions to village Development committees, 20 primary health centers and 200 sub health posts have been established in various village development committees. Besides, arrangements have been made for additional female community health volunteers. In respect of curative services, additional physical facilities have been made available in Bir Hospital, Kanti Children\\'s Hospital and Indra Rajya Laxmi Maternity Hospital and they have also been furnished with necessary equipment and instruments. besides, buildings and family quarters for 2 regional hospitals and 6 zonal hospitals are under construction. In keeping with the policy of running a 15 bed hospital in each district, the construction of hospital buildings is underway in 10 districts. In addition to providing Medicines and equipments to hospitals and other health organizations, health lab services, health education, nutrition and other activities have been conducted. Regarding the ayurvedic services, works for the development of Naradevi Hospital and Singh Durbar Vaidyakhana have been initiated and the hospital in Dang has already started providing services. Existing Problems The problems encountered in the implementation of various programmes and projects designed for the seventh plan are similar to those annually experienced in the implementation of the previous plans of these, of course, the problems that arose from the dearth of manpower and physical facilities in the health organizations and those concerned with administrative and financial management appear to be the major ones. They are as follows. 1. Owing to the topographical difficulties and the pressure exerted by the growth in the number of patients, the health sector has not been able to make primary health services available to the targeted populations. if in the Himalayan and hill regions the walking distance itself has been a problem in the Terai belt, because of the pressure of the increased number of patients it has been difficult to provide even minimum health services. It has, therefore, been pointed out that further efforts should be made in the coming plans for boosting the general health level of the Nepalese people in consonance with the target of health for all by 2000 A.D. Besides, as per the commitment made by Nepal in the SAARC Summit for Children 1989 and the World Summit for Children. 1990, health services for children have to be toned up, too. The objective, policy and programmes of the Eighth Plan are as follows. Objective 1. To produce healthy manpower necessary for development by improving the general health status of the people; 2. To raise the health status of the rural people by reaching basic primary health and medical services done to the village level; 3. To control population by making mother and child health and family planning services effective as per the people\\'s aspirations at the local level; 1. In order to make health services available on a phased basis to each Village Development Committee, the services of women health volunteers, sub-health posts, health posts and primary health centres will be provided at wards, village development committees and electoral constituencies respectively. Preventive and promotive service will be provided in an integrated manner through these media. 2. Integrated primary health service will be provided through the primary health centres. Besides, hospital bed service will be made available, in primary health centres, for maternity and emergency treatments. 3. Sub-health posts will be established in Village Development Committees only on the basis of people\\'s  participation. 4. Curative services will be developed on the basis of referral system. To support the referral system a  coordination net -work covering primary health centres and district, zonal and national hospitals will be established. 5. The central hospitals will be developed as specialist hospitals. 6. To make specialist and general curative services available within the kingdom itself, the private sector  also will be mobilized. For this, a policy of providing facilities will be adopted. 7. Family Planning and Maternal Child Health services will be implemented under integrated primary  health services. In providing the family planning services it will be seen that means of temporary and permanent family planning are provided as per the preference of the clientele. However, priority will be given to the concept of birth spacing. And, services related to the temporary means will be expanded accordingly. 8. In order to minimize the effects of malnutrition on women and children, the nutrition programme will  be extended. Programmes for the treatment of micro-nutrient deficiencies, anemia, Vitamin A deficiency and iodine deficiency will be implemented. 9. Emphasis will be placed on strengthening the management capability of health organizations, village - level to central, and their functional capabilities will be enhanced. 10. Stress will be laid on the phasewise development and strengthening of the Ayrurvedic system. Emphasis will be given to the consolidation of the existing organizations and the manufacture of medicines, manpower development, research, and so on. 11. Development of traditional medical systems such as Yunani, homoeopathy and naturopathy will be encouraged as much as possible. 12. To regularize and standardize the supply of medicines, policies and legal provisions governing medicines will be revised and importers and retailers of medicines will be given professional trainings. To motivate the manufacture of essential medicines within the country itself, participation by the private sector will be encouraged. In the government sector, however, the function of coordinating medical research and manufacture will be assigned to one single institution. 13. People engaged in traditional forms of treatment will be used in the dissemination of information pertaining to health, nutrition and family planning. The NGO sector will be involved in this function. 14. In order to effectualize the administrative, management and supervisory aspects of\\thealth services, Regional health Directorate and District Public Health Offices will be provided with required manpower and decentralized authority. 15. Health institutions will be helped to become financiallly self-reliant as far as possible. In the adoption of this policy due consideration will be given to the principle of social justice as well. 16. In the programmes related to management and services of health institutions, local bodies will be involved and made accountable. 17. For the development of health services, a policy of promoting participation of national international NGOs, private enterprises and foreign investors will be adopted. 18. To produce in a planned way the additional manpower necessary for different health organizations and service-oriented programmes, the functional aspects of the institute of Medicine and other health training institutes will be expanded and their training capabilities will be enhanced. 19. For improvement in the health service system, studies and research centered on themes like institutional development, management of resources, methods of preventive and curative treatment etc. will be conducted. To ensure accountability, the concerned organization will be provided with necessary physical facilities and their fields of activity will be expanded. 22. Programmes for the rehabilitation of the physically infirm and disabled will be developed and implemented. Priorities 1. To extend primary health services down to the village level; 2. To improve the physical facility and management aspects for the expansion of services; 3. To emphasize the use of temporary methods of family planning; and 1. Basic Primary Health Service The basic primary health services include preliminary treatment of common diseases, immunization against infectious diseases, mother and child health services, family planning services, and management of essential drugs. They also include  health education, knowledge of food and nutrition and the dissemination of information about clean drinking water, sanitation and environment. These programmes, which were earlier being implemented separately under various vertical projects, are now conducted by a single body as per the policy of providing preventive, promotive and curative treatments in an integrated manner from the service as well as cost effective point of view. Thus, by the end of the Seventh Plan period, integrated primary health services were provided throughout the kingdom at Ilaka- level health posts distributed over the districts. Vaccines are given to girls and women of 15 to 44 years of age. In addition to this, services such as collection of blood samples from malaria patients, treatments of tuberculosis and leprosy, family planning services, treatments of diarrhoeal, respiratory and malnutrional diseases and health education are provided. In the Eighth Plan period, services of female community health volunteers, health posts, sub-health posts and primary health centres will, in line with the health Policy 1991, be provided for the development of primary health services at ward, Village Development Committee and electoral constituency levels. The provision of female community women health volunteers has been made with the objective of providing simple primary health services and health education at the doorsteps of villagers. Started in the fiscal year 1988 -89, this programme has been implemented in 58 districts by 1991-92 and now has 24,000 female community health volunteers engaged in it. In the Eighth Plan period, 12,000 FCH volunteers will be trained for the remaining 17 districts, so that the services of these volunteers could eventually by available all over the kingdom. In this programme, women\\'s participation will bemobilized to the maximum in order to achieve a reduction in the high fertility rate and infant mortality rate. These women volunteers will visit hom e to home in the wards individually assigned to them and provide simple treatments that fall under primary health services. Moreover, these health volunteers will help enhance health awareness of the villagers and will also promote women\\'s participation in the process of development. 1.2 \\tSub-health Posts, Health Posts and Primary Health Centres Every Village Development Committee in the kingdom will be considered as the basic level for health services, and in the Eighth Plan period, 3,199 sub-health posts will be established in Village Development Committees through people\\'s participation. Each sub-health post will be provided with 3 health workers consisting of one auxiliary health worker, one village health worker and one mother and child health worker. Through the sub-health posts, services pertaining to vaccination, treatment of diseases such as malaria, leprosy and tuberculosis; family planning, mother and child health; nutrition; and health and environmental education will be provided down to the ward level. The health posts will provide services similar to those provided by the sub-health posts. The health posts that now exist in 205 electoral constituencies of the kingdom will be gradually upgraded so that each constituency can have one of its health posts converted into a primary health centre. For this, in the Eighth Plan period 100 primary health centres will be established as per the Health Services Policy, and this will lead to an increase of 300 beds. Each primary health centre will have 3 beds, 2 of them for emergency service and 1 for maternity service and 1 doctor will be deputed to each centre. To make the primary health and treatment services, to be provided at local, district and regional levels, effective, Regional Health Directorates and District Public Health programmes will be strengthened. In 50 districts,  district health and medical services will be launched in an integrated manner. These institutes will formulate district health plans, and will implement and evaluate them. In order to render the district-level health administration effective, the management aspect of the administration will be improved. 1.3 \\tFamily Planning and Maternal Child Health The main obje3ctive of the Family Planning and Maternal Child Health Programme is to control the growth of population in a planned way ameliorating the standard of living of the people by minimizing the possible adverse impact of the population growth on the economic and social development of the country. It also aims at protecting the health of pregnant and lactating mothers and of children below 5 years of age. The Eighth Plan aims to bring down the fertility rate to 4.5 per 1000, in keeping with the long-term aim of decreasing the current rate of 5.8 to 4 per 1000 by 2000 A.D. For this, 1,246,800 couples will be provided family planning services during the Eighth Plan period. The current status of contraceptive prevalence rate of 23 percent will be raised to 32 percent. Family planning services will be made available in hospitals, primary health centres, health posts and sub- health posts. The Depo-Provera programme will be extended from its present locus to the Village Development Committee and the Norplant and I.U.D. programmes from the hospital to the health post level. The condom and pills programme will be expanded through female community health volunteers. The laparoscopy service will be provided through regional and district hospitals. Services such as vasectomy and minilap will be provided through mobile camps organized for the purpose. The Eighth Plan has the target of decreasing the current maternal mortality rate of 850 per 100,000 births down to 450 per 100,000 births by 2000 A.D. For the achievement of this purpose, the Plan has the target of reducing the maternal mortality rate to 750 per 100,000 live births. For this, 1,704,000 pregnant and lactating mothers and 1,485,000 children below 5 years of age will be provided health services. In order to render mother and child health services effective, mother and child health clinics will be extended down to the ward level. Moreover, traditional birth attendants, auxiliary health workers, assistant nurse- midwives, and mother and child health workers will be given different types of trainings. For the purpose of extending family planning down to the village level and for institutionalizing it at that level, construction programmes have been incorporated in the Eighth Plan. In the Eighth Plan period, primary health centres (100 in number), staff quarters (in 71 places), clinical training centres in 3 Development Regions (Middle, Eastern and Mid-Western), and 4 regional stores (1 each in Pathalaiya, Dhangadhi, Butwal and Nepalgunj) will be constructed. To make this programme effective, emphasis will be placed on factors such as training, participation by NGOs and also on aspects such as coordination and supervision. 1.4 \\tControl of Malaria, Black Fever and Encephelitis In Nepal, the Malaria Eradication programme has been in operatio n since 1958. In the Eighth Plan, the aim is to spray insecticides twice annually in each malaria prone area inhabited by a population of 600,000 to 800,000, collect and test 350,750 blood samples, treat persons identified as malarial cases, conduct reserach programmes, and get people to participate in the control of malaria. On the kalazar and encephalitis fronts, the Eighth Plan aims as spraying insecticides, conducting entomological surveys and providing treatment to people suffering from these diseases. 1.5 \\tExpanded programme on Immunization The Expanded Programme on Immunization was launched as a unit providing various forms of immunization vaccine services after Nepal was declared smallpox-free in 1975.Under the programme, children of 0-1 year of age, are given D.P.T., polio, measles and BCG vaccines, and girls and women of 15-44 years of age are provided the tetanus toxide injection. Implemented only in 35 districts in the Sixth Plan, this programme was implemented in all districts of the Kingdom within the Seventh Plan period. By the end of the fiscal year 1991-92 BCG vaccine has been provided to 83 percent, DPT 3 and polio 3 to 74 percent and antimeasles vaccine to 64 percent of children. Tetanus toxide was administered to 16 percent of girls and women of 15 to 49 years of age. In the Eighth Plan period, this programme will be strengthened on an institutional basis. The vaccination services will be increased by 2 percent in the first 3 years of the Plan and by 1 percent in each of the remaining 2 years so that by the end of the Plan period 92 percent of the targeted population will benefit from them. By the fiscal year 1994-95 infant- tetanus will be completely eradicated. By the fiscal year 1994-95 infant- tetanus will be completely eradicated. Death of children by measles will be reduced by 90 percent. Besides all these, measures will be taken to prepare an infrastructure necessary for the eradiation of polio by 2000 A.D. To achieve the stated objective the immunization services will be extended through a micro-planning to the hospitals, health posts and upto the ward level. In the Eighth Plan, the aim is to provide DPT, polio, BCG and measles antidotes to 3,139,232 children and tetanus toxide injections to 4,031,731 women and pregnant mothers. In the execution of this programme surveillance and cold chain systems will be used, and in addition to imparting continuity to surveillance, the evaluation system will be made effective from the health post level to the district and central level. 1.6 \\tTuberculosis Control The Tuberculosis Preventive Programme had been implemented as a pilot programme in 1965. Until  now , however , tuberculosis is considered as a major contagious disease, and 4 to 5 persons in a population of 1000 are estimated to come under its sway. For the control of this disease, a long-term  programme has been formulated which aims at reducing its incidence rate to even less than 1 percent and its prevalence rate to 2 persons in a population of 1000. Until now implemented in 55 districts, this programme will, in the Eighth Plan period, be extended to all  the remaining 20 districts of the kingdom. For the Plan period, the target is to test the cough samples of 643,976 suspects and provide them treatment if the test results show positive, and treat chronic cases, resistant and relapse cases and cases of other types. Besides, to institutionalise the tuberculosis control progrmme, National Tuberculosis Centre at the central level will be strengthened. 1.7 \\tLeprosy Control The Leprosy Control Programme has been implemented as a pioneer programme in 1962. Currently being launched in 56 districts of the kingdom, this programme will be extended to 15 other districts so that the total number of the programme-districts will reach 71. The target is to reduce the leprosy prevalence rate to less than 1 person in a population of 1000. To achieve this target, 40,000 smear tests will be conducted and 1,550 lepers will be provided in-door services. For the Plan period, it is targeted to provide multi-drug therapy through health posts by training 1,500 health workers. The other target is to lay stress on health education and identify persons afflicted with leprosy and also to admit irregular and drop-out cases to regular treatment services. This project has been launched with the objective of making the common people conscious about health by imparting health education through information dissemination, trainings and seminars. In the Eighth Plan period, health education will be imparted to teachers, health-related people and social workers through programmes like trainings and seminars. For this, works such as production and distribution of educational materials, strengthening of health education, organization of trainings, seminars\\tand  information dissemination strategies, and providing assistance to other institutions will be carried out. With the objective of generating health awareness among the common people and bringing about positive behavioural change by familiarizing them with the small family concept, educational materials will be produced and distributed. Through these materials information will be disseminated about family planning, maternal and child health, immunization, diarrhoeal and respiratory problems, diseases such as malaria, leprosy and tuberculosis, physical infirmities, blindness, mental disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and malnutrition. The target is to produce 10.2 million copies of educational materials in different languages and distribute them during the plan period. It is also targeted to publish (1,440 times), display the materials (35,886 times) and provide health education training to health workers (1,150 in number). 1.9 \\tNutrition Programme The Nutrition Programme has been continuing since the implementation of the Fifth Plan, with the objective of improving the nutritional status of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Surveys carried out from time to time have shown that in Nepal, children have suffered from various degrees of malnutrition and pregnant and post-delivery mothers from anaemia and iron deficiency. For improving this situation it is necessary to launch health and multi-sectoral nutrition programmes. To solve the nutritional problem it is essential to improve food production and distribution pattern and also to boost the purchasing power of the people and reform their habits of food consumption. During the Eighth Plan period, the target is to reduce child malnutrition by half, provide antidotes against anaemis, and decrease iron deficiency- in compliance with nutritional target by the year 2000 A.D. For this, the Eighth Plan aims at treating the malnutritional problems of 2,720,964 children in proportion to their physical growths, anaemic problems of 1,260,569 pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers and Vitamin A deficiency problems of 52,714 children. This programme will be launched through sub -health posts, health posts, primary health centres and hospitals by involving Female Health Volunteers and Maternal Child Health Workers at the grass root level. 1.10 \\tDiarrhoea Control In Nepal, children below 5 years of age are subject to diarrhoeal problems. As an effort for controlling this disease, this programme has been continuing since the second year (1985-86) of the Seventh Plan. The Eighth Plan aims at reducing the under-5 mortality by diarrhoea by 32 percent and decreasing the number of diarrhoeal cases by 20 percent. For this, the use of R./D. Sol will be increased from the 60 percent (as it is now) in the correct way will be raised form the current 2.25 percent to 25 percent in the current plan period, 7,500,000 packets of R.D. Sol will be purchased for distribution,  rehydration therapy centres will be established in 200 health posts, 15,000 primary school teachers and 60,000 scouts will be trained in rehydration therapy technology, and 4,000 health workers will be given basic and refresher trainings. In the Plan period, information about and free distribution of R.D.Sol will reach door to door through village health workers. 1.11 \\tRespiratory Disease Control  In the kingdom, 2,300,000 children under 5 are afflicted with this disease, and it is estimated that 45,000  of those children will die of it. This programme was started in the fiscal year 1987 -88 with the objective of reducing children\\'s morbidity and death, both of which result from the acquisition of this disease. Currently operating in 50 districts, this programme will, under the Eighth Plan, be extended to 20 other districts. In the Eighth Plan period, 778,000 respiratory patients will be provided treatment and medicines, 3,881 health technicians will be trained, and 400 traditional healers, and political and social workers of 70 districts will be given necessary orientation. 2. Curative Service To upgrade the quality of health services, it is imperative that preventive as well as curative medical services be upgraded. By the end of the Seventh Plan period, the number of hospitals had risen to 111 and the number of hospital beds to 4,717. According to the population estimat e for 1989, this increase provides 1 hospital bed to every 3,967 persons. For the development of medical services, the referral system will be consolidated in the Eighth Plan. The hospitals have been classified as national, regional, zonal and district hospitals. District hospitals will be provided with 15 to 25 beds each, zonal hospitals with 50 to 150 each, and regional hospitals with 50 to 250 each. Central hospitals will be provided with 100 to 300 beds as well as with specialist services. 2.1 \\tBir Hospital Additional 300 beds will be added in the Bir Hospital to develop at as the national central level hospital. In addition to the present available special units other new special units will be established and management will be made to assign respect ive specialists in the special jobs. 2.2 \\tKanti Children\\'s Hospital The only children\\'s hospital in the kingdom, Kanti Hospital will be developed into a national referral hospital. For this, 150 more beds will be added, additional physical facilities and quipment and instruments will be provided. However, curative services for children will be provided in regional and zonal hospitals as well. 2.3 \\tInfectious Diseases Hospital The Infectious Diseases Hospital will be developed into an Infectious Diseases Service Centre with an addition of 100 beds. For this it will be furnished with necessary manpower, physical facilities and equ ipment. 2.4 \\tIndra Rajya Laxmi maternity Hospital The Eighth Plan aims at developing Indra Rajya Laxmi Maternity Hospital into a centre providing specialist services in the areas of maternity and gynecology by an addition of 250 beds. This hospital will be developed so as to make it capable of providing child health and family planning services. 2.5 \\tOther Hospitals The mental Hospital will be provided with 50 more beds. Naradevi Ayurvedic Hospital will be provided with 100 more beds and the Homoeopathy Hospital with 10 more. As per the policy of establishing a regional hospital in each of the Development Regions except in Central Development Region, Seti Hospital will, in the Eighth Plan period, be converted into a regional hospital for the Far Western Development Region, and for this, hospital and residential buildings will be constructed. In the process of increasing the number of beds and physical facilities in the zonal hospitals, Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital will be provided with 8 family quarters, Janakpur Zonal Hospital with 25 more beds, Bharatpur Hospital with a new building with the capacity of holding 100 beds, Baglung Hospital with 10  additional beds, Jumla Hospital with 10 additional beds. In keeping with the policy of providing every district with the service of a minimum of 15 bed hospital in  the Kingdom, the hospital buildings currently under construction in the ten districts will be completed, and, on their completion, services will be started. There will be a policy of continuing the construction of residential buildings in district, zonal and regional hospital premises. Koirala Institute of Health Science in Dharan, B.P. Cancer Hospital, and hospitals and nursing homes to be run by private and NGO sectors. In the Eighth Plan period, a package programme will be launched for equipping hospital with manpower, medicines and equipment, \\xa0 commensurate with their levels. To make the health organizations economically self -reliant as much as possible, hospital development committees will be instituted. The committees will be motivated towards adopting various measures of resource mobilization with people\\'s participation in management. 3. Ayurved and Other Traditional Systems The Ayurvedic service as such forms an integral part of health services. In line with the policy of developing Ayurvedic services in a phased manner, district -level Ayurvedic hospitals will be established, 100 beds will be added in Naradevi Hospital, and the construction of buildings for the Ayurvedic hospital in Dang will be completed. The physical facilities of the Ayurvedic hospitals will be expanded and their management capabilities toned up. Singh Durbar Vaidyakhana will be provided with more physical facilities and with equipment so that it could enhance quality in the manufacture of medicines. Further attention will be paid to the establishment of regional rural pharmacies and training centres. 4. Goitre and Cretinism Control The programme of distributing iodized salt for the prevention of goitre, which results from iodine deficiency, has been in operation since the fiscal year 1972-73. To control goitre and help the physical as well as mental development of the people, 57,500 quintals of iodized salt will be distributed in the Himalayan and northern mountain belts of the country, where this disease is widespread. For the storage of iodized slat in different places in the kingdom, 11 warehouses will be constructed. In the Eighth Plan period, 500,000 metric tons of iodized salt will be distributed under the iodization management programme. In addition to the implementation of the programme for the distribution of iodized salt for the prevention  of goitre which is caused by iodine deficiency, the programme of giving iodine injection to children in order to save them from dumbness and speech defects and from mental infirmities has been in operation since 1979. The main objective of this programme is to eradicate goitre and speech defects- both resulting from iodine deficiency- by giving iodine injection to most of the people of the northern belt of the kingdom. The aim is to reduce goitre incidence from 42 percent to 35 percent and to provide iodine injection to a population of 5,335,000 in 41 districts for immunizing the children born in these districts from goitre. Besides, in 2 districts studies on the effect of the iodine injection will be conducted. 5. Environmental Health Programme This programme has been going on since the beginning of the Seventh Plan. The objective of the programme is to keep drinking water hygienically clean, construct latrines, control insects and rodents, ensure preservation of foodstuffs, and prevent pollution of air by vehicular traffic fumes in urban areas and by smoke rising from household fires in rural areas. For the promotion of environmental health, booklets and pamphlets will be produced in collaboration with the Health Education Section and distributed through health posts, health centres, hospitals and training centres. Moreover, surveys of the impacts of environment on health will be conducted. 6. Drug Management The major objective of the programme related to drug management is to provide qualitatively effective medicines, help maintain the quality of medicines, ensure supplies of medicines of superior quality only and to stop the marketing of spurious and toxic medicines. In the Eighth Plan period, a drug testing lab will be established, which will test medicines and ensure the  quality of the medicines sold in the medical market. Drug Acts and laws will be effectively enforced. Trainings in basic knowledge of medicines will be provided to 2000 persons engaged in the sales of medicines. Inspection will be made of 182 drug industries and 1,450 medicines will be sample-tested. In order to encourage drug industries, facilitating legal provisions will be made in custom & income tax to provide incentives on raw materials, equipment, instruments and tools. Appropriate measures will be taken to produce manpower essential for the Drug Testing Lab. To make drugs and equipment regularly available to all increasing health institutions, District Medical stores will be established in 10 districts. Medical stores established at the regional level will be developed and expanded. Works relating to the construction of physical infrastructures necessary for the medical stores will be completed. 7. Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Aids This programme was launched in the fiscal year 1988-89 to control, on time, social and economic hazards emerging from the increase in the number of people suffering from sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS. The principal objective of the programme is to look after cases of sexually transmitted disease, train health workers engaged in the treatment of such cases, and educate the different sections of the society about the process of identifying cases of sexually transmitted diseases, the importance of diagnosing and treating these diseases, the natural ways of escaping from them, and so on. Under the Eighth Plan, training in lab techniques will be provided to 300 persons. Blood samples related to AIDS will be collected from 25,000 persons and surveys will be conducted by using the samples. The Eighth Plan aims at establishing labs for experimentations on matters connected with AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in 20 districts. It also aims at constructing a building for a 10-bed AIDS control hospital and 2 hostel buildings. Information regarding AIDS will be widely disseminated by including AIDS in health education programmes, and in the information dissemination, cooperation will be sought from S.T.D. clinics, drug abuse rehabilitation centres, social workers, political figures, teachers, family planning institutes, NGOs and journalists. 8. Epidemiological Programme Under the Epidemiology Programme, zoonotic, rabies and other infectious diseases are being diagnosed  and controlled. In the Eighth Plan period, research works relating to the prevention and control of infectious diseases will be conducted. Indicators of epidemic disease will be developed. Sentinel surveillances programmes will be extended to all hospitals in the kingdom. Necessary steps will be taken to stop infectious diseases from developing into epidemics. Studies focused on non-infectious diseases such as heart disease and cnacer will be completed. Research on the identification of the species of insects that bear bacteria of infectious diseases, other than malaria, phyleria, encephalitis, black fever and plague, and on their general habits and behaviours will be conducted. In the Eighth Plan period, for the control of rabies, vaccines will be provided through the cold chain system to the districts and the injection services will thus be extended to the district level. In the treatment of rabies, the use of indigenous vaccines will be encouraged. A study will also be carried out on the disease of plague. Information about infectious diseases will be disseminated in coor dination with the health education sector. 9. Health Laboratories The health lab services have been mobilized in order to make effective diagnosis of diseases and to examine the activities of toxic and infectious bacteria in drinking water and foodstuffs. The Eighth Plan aims at providing district-level health lab services to 16 districts, zonal-level lab services to all zonal hospitals, regional-level lab services to all regional hospitals, and preliminary lab services to 50 health centres and health posts. The labs in the sub-health posts will examine malaria parasites, leprosy viruses and polio rex, and also conduct pathological testing of stool and urine and of tuberculosis. The health posts will be provided with microscopes and other accessories as well as with chemical drugs. The district-level labs will run hematological, biochemical and parasitological services. The zonal and regional labs, on the other hand, will provide hematology, bacteriology, biochemistry, histopathology and parasitological services. On top of these, lab services concerning diagnosis of contagious diseases and biopsy of cancer cases will be made available. Central health Lab at Teku will be developed into the National Lab providing specialist services. Under the Eighth Plan, this will be furnished with ultra- modern machinery. The construction of lab buildings in 10 districts, a regional lab building in Surkhet  and a training building in Kathmandu will be completed. In the plan period, 300 persons will be given pilot trai ning in order to produce necessary manpower for running the health labs at district -level and health posts. Moreover, 10 health labs will be strengthened. 10. Nursing Improvement Programme The training courses will aim at developing the professional knowledge and skills of nurses and assistant nurse-midwives attached to hospitals and health centres. The trainings will help to enhance the quality of the nursing service. 11. Nepal health Research Council Nepal Medical Research Committee, which had been conducting research essential for the development and expansion in the area of health, was converted into Nepal Health Research Council in the fiscal year 1990-91. Under Nepal Health Research Council, scientific research projects on themes such as kalazar, tuberculosis, leprosy, human reproduction, mother and child food habits and practices, hepatic diseases and non-contagious diseases of chronic turn and age maturity will be conducted. Specialist services of a mobile team will be provided, once in a year, to an under -developed district in each Development Region. 13. Development of Health Sector Manpower The availability of manpower is an essential precondition for delivering primary health services to the local level in keeping with the long-term objective of health service in the Eighth Plan. For this, a manpower plan will be formulated to meet the basic, medium and high -level manpower needs of health organizations. As regards the basic and medium level manpower production, the training centres will provide pre-service and in-services trainings in an integrated form in accordance with the integrated Primary Health Service Policy. A policy will be adopted for the production of the high-level manpower within the country itself by mobilizing both the government and private sectors. As far as the specialist manpower is concerned, there will be a policy of sending trainees to foreign institutes of repute. Trainings for the basic and middle level manpower, essential for health institutions ranging down to the local level, will be organized and placed under various concerned programmes conducted at the health training centres. Under the pre-service programmes, village health workers, maternal child health workers, female community health volunteers auxiliary health workers will be trained. The refresher training programme related to preventive and general health services will be provided, as required, to health workers, from the employees of District Public Health Sections to female community health volunteers. In order to meet the needs of primary health centres and sub-health post to be established in the Eighth Plan period, 3,200 assistant health workers and another 3,200 child health workers will be trained. Professional competence of health technicians working at district and local levels will be upgraded through refresher trainings. In the same way, primary school teachers and health personnel working in governmental health organizations will be given training related to primary health services. For the development of nursing services, in-service trainings will be organised for nurses and assistant nurse-midwives. In order to reduce the maternal mortality rates in the villages, 6,000 midwives will be trained in mother and child health techniques. Similarly, the work like curriculum revision, publication of manuals and production of educational materials will be undertaken for the purpose of refining the health related training programmes. The supply of high-level health manpower required for the development of curative services will be met through the Institute of Medicine and by employing people educated abroad through private funding. With a view to achieving self-reliance in the production of high -level manpower, B.P. Koirala Institute of health Science will be established in Dharan. This Institute is expected to produce 50 to 100 doctors. Suitable policies will also be adopted to encourage the establishment and operation of medical colleges in the private sector. For manpower training and production, the existing five regional training centres and the training centre in Janakpur will be provided with more physical facilities including buildings. This will help to enhance the functional capabilities of these organizations and strengthen them. A central training centre will be established which will ensure the operational efficiency of all training centres. 14. Management The management aspects of health organizations, from central down to district level, will be strengthened  in line with the national policy of supplying technical manpower to health institutions. For this, the supervision mechanism covering manpower training and management will be made effective. Flow of medicines, equipm ent and other goods to the health organization will be regularized and managed properly. To strengthen planning, follow-up, supervision, and evaluation aspects, statistical formats will be structured, which will help to develop an integrated information system. A health information bulletin will be published on a regular basis. For the evaluation of programmes implemented in the health sector, monitoring and evaluation indicators will be developed and with the help of the indicators mid-term and full-term evaluations will be made. 15. Miscellaneous Information about the hazards of addictions such as smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages and the use of  drugs will be widely disseminated. For the rehabilitation of the physically infirm and disabled, programmes will be developed and implemented through the private sector as well as NGOs. Since the safety of blood and blood products has a very significant role to play in the control of AIDS, in the Eighth Plan period, the Blood Bank run under Nepal Red Cross will be as much assisted as possible. Books, papers and journals essential for raising the standard of research in health will be provided through the National Health Information Service Centre. The centre will run library and communication services which will provide information related to preventive, curative and health promotive health services. Implementation Arrangements 1. For effective execution of the programmes incorporated in the Eighth Plan, health organizations, down  to the local level, will be made capable as well as accountable in line with the principle of decentralization. Besides, for a qualitative development of health services, the private sector also will be encouraged. 2. Basic primary health services will be provided in keeping with the concept of integrated health service. These services will be provided through female community health volunteers, sub-health posts, health posts and primary health centres. For this, the management aspects of Regional health Directorates, Public Health Office, hospitals and health centres will be toned up. Drinking Water and Sanitation Introduction Drinking water including minimum sanitary facility constitutes one of the basic needs for the people. In spite of several programmes launched in the areas of drinking water and sanitation, under the previous- plans, a large segment of the country\\'s population still remains deprived of these facilities. In mountain areas in particular, people have to waste time and energy walking fairly long distances for fetching drinking water. This has, indirectly affected production. Besides, there has been no noticeable decrease in the communicable diseases acquired through the. use of water from sources continually prone to pollution. On the sanitation side, too, nothing substantial has yet been achieved. In this context, drinking water facilities have to be expanded for the creation of a situation where the energy and time wasted by the households for. fetching water could be utilized for production-oriented activities and to raise the general health level of people living in rural areas, Similarly, it is also equally necessary to give attention to aspects such as personal hygiene, and households community and environmental sanitation.\\' In view of rapidly growing urbanization and the pressure exerted \\'by the growth of population in urban areas, it is deemed necessary to improve the water supply both quantitatively and qualitatively and densely populated urban areas have to be provided with better sewer age and waste disposal facilities. Progress During the Seventh Plan it is estimated that during the Seventh Plan period drinking water facility has -been provided to a total of 2,715, 000 people 2,447,000 in the rural areas and 268,000 in the urban areas. Likewise, on the sanitation side, an additional 32,000 people have been provided with latrine facilities through the construction of 4,000 latrines under the Low-cost Latrine Programme. Progress During the Fiscal Years 1990-91 and 1991-92 In the fiscal year 1990-91, drinking water facility was provided to an additional 483,000 people - 454,000 in the rural areas and 29,000 in the urban areas. similarly, it is expected that in the fiscal year 1991-92, a total of 830,000 people - 821,000 in the rural areas and 9,000 people in the urban areas, would benefit from drinking water facility. Thus, by the end of the fiscal year 1991-92, a total of 78,71,000 people (42 percent) 6,699,000 (39 percent) people in rural areas and 1,172,000 (67 percent) people in urban areas will be provided with drinking-water facility. In the same way a total of 1,112,000 (6 percent) people - 513,000 (3 percent) in villages and 599,000 (34 percent) people living in urban areas - will receive sanitation facilities. Existing Problems The problems encountered so far in the implementation of drinking water and sanitation programmes are as follows: 1. In view of implementation capability, the governmentlevel programmes are ambitious and, therefore, there has been low physical achievement as compared to target. 2. \\tinstitutional arrangements to take the drinking water and sanitation programmes down to the village level are not properly identified. 3 \\tThe government agencies are engaged in projects that have greater per capita cost and long ges tation period. 4. The projects are handed over to the Users\\' committees only after they are complete. This practice has toned down the users\\' enthusiasm and has ultimately made maintenance of the completed projects difficult. 5. District and Village-Level bodies are not involved in the selection, design, implementation and maintenance of the projects. 6. In rural areas drinking water and sanitation programmes are not conducted in an integrated manner. 7. The involvement of NGOs and the private sector is not adequate. 8. Adequate effort is not made for the development and extension of appropriate time -tuned technology in order to reduce per-capita cost. 9. In spite of spending the total budgeted money, the targeted physical progress is not achieved because th e body implementing the plan is not directly accountable to the people. 10. Programme implementation is delayed giving rise to cost escalation due to lack of timely disbursement of budget. Background of the Eighth Plan Since it appears that most of the projects completed in the past stand in need of maintenance, it has not been possible to supply required quantity of drinking water to people already provided with drinking water facilities. Thus, it appears that a great amount of resources will have to be invested for the reconstruction of the existing projects. Similarly, it appears that the selection of projects that can be completed within a short period of time and at smaller investment has been overlooked and not much effort is made towards involving the users in construction works. This seems to have been the case in drinking water arrangements in urban areas, particularly the Kathmandu Valley. The current leakage of 40 percent of drinking water has been another acute problem. in view of the scenario that the supply of drinking water may become a major problem the world over in coming years, special steps have to be taken to make consumers aware about the proper use of drinking water. The target of providing drinking water facilities to the entire population of the kingdom in the next 10 years can be achieved only if drinking water and sanitary-facilities are widely expanded -with active participation of the beneficiaries in project planning, construction, maintenance and monitoring. Furthermore, achievement of this challenging target would require flexible policy, maximum mobilization of available resources, participation of private and government sectors, research on low cost technologies, etc. Objective During the Eighth Plan period, drinking water and sanitation programmes will be launched for achieving the following objectives: 1. To provide drinking water facility to 72 percent of the population, in consorannce with the target of providing such facility to the entire population in the next 10 years. 2. To provide basic knowledge of sanitation and sanitary facilities to maximum number of people along with cleaning and conservation of environment. Policy In the implementation of drinking water and sanitation programmes, the following policies will be adopted: 1. A list of all projects, big and small, will be prepared, at district level through survey and construction will be carried out accordingly. However, in the selection of projects, water right will be adequately honored. 2. Drinking water facilities will be expanded in the rural areas of Terai by installing shallow tubewells, deep-set tubewells and construction of wells. Appropriate arrangements will be made for the maintenance and repair of wells and tubewells currently in use. 3. Rural drinking water and sanitation programmes will be implemented in an integrated manner. 4. In view of the fact that drinking water and sanitation programmes in the rural areas cannot be successfully implemented and maintained or repaired without the participation of women, women\\'s participation will be sought in these programmes. 5. Priority will be given to projects which are small, require a lesser per capita cost, can attract people\\'s participation, and can be implemented maintained and repaired at grassroot level, and to projects designed for remote and areas areas inhabited by backward communities or virtually deprived of drinking water and sanitation facilities. 6. The existing irrigation system will be improved and arrangements will be made for helping local people to use irrigation water for drinking purpose as well. 7. Drinking water and sanitation programmes will be conducted in consonance with the local settlement pattern and situation. 8. To imple ment the drinking water and sanitation programmes perseveringly, necessary revisions will be made in the guidelines prepared in 1990. 9. In all stages of drinking water project, i.e. identification, design, implementation and maintenance, involvement Users\\' Community will be made mandatory. 9. In all stages of drinking water project, i.e. identification, design, implementation and maintenance, involvement Users\\' Community will be made mandatory. 10. The Users\\' Committee will be involved in the detailed survey, design, cost estimate, etc. of projects in rural areas. The implementing agency will deposit the fund provided by the government as well as the fund raised by the users in a near-by bank and the bank account will be operated on the joint signature of a person designated by the Users\\' Committee and a representative of the implementing agency. If the. construction work of a project-has to be done through a contractor, approval of Users\\' Committee on the matter will be made mandatory. 11. NGOs, local bodies and the private sector will be involved in the works connected with the installation of shallow and deep-set tubewells, construction of wells. and maintenance thereof in the rural areas of Tarai Similarly a policy of involving NGOs and private sector in construction works of drinking water projects benefiting to a maximum of five hundred persons in rural areas and conservation /protection of water sources will be adopted. Rural drinking water projects constructed at government level will be gradually handed over to the Users\\' Committee. In this regard a suitable policy framework will be worked out and implemented. 12. Arrangements will be made to involve the private sector and NGOs in the implementation of drinking water and sanitation programmes. It will be seen that their implementation processes are uniform. 13. Research on and development of low-cost and locally viable technologies will be carried out through both NGOs and NGOS. The technologies then developed will be widely distributed. 14. Drinking water projects can be constructed by companies set up under joint ownership of the private sector consumers and local bodies. For such activities bank loans and government grants will be made available. 15. Purchase of materials required for any rural drinking water project can be made only if jointly approved by the Users\\' Committee and the technician. Besides, the purchase will have to be made in proportion to the progress achieved in the project work or with the consent of the Users\\' Committee. 16. In rural areas, people\\'s awareness towards health and sanitation will be raised through health education. For this, proper coordination will be maintained with the education and health sectors. 17. Under the sanitation rogramme, the concerned bodies/agencies will provide training in latrine\\tpconstruction and production of construction materials. In addition they will develop and disseminate low-cost technologies that suit the local geographical/ topographical conditions. 18. As government effort alone will not suffice to reduce leakage in water supply system, support of consumers will also be sought. 19. Sewer lines and used-water ducts will be constructed and extended in the major urban areas. 20. As it is not possible to carryout sanitary works in urban areas through a single body, training programmes aimed at making people aware of the importance of sanitation will be organized, which will eventually help to improve the local environment. Appropriate policy will be formulated for the executing agency to maintain close linkage with the municipalities and the social workers while implementing the programmes. 21. Arrangements will be made to prevent the ill effects of dumped filth and garbage on people\\'s health. 23. In order to improve the water supply system for meeting the needs of the growing urban population, priority will be given to the utilization of springs and water bodies available in the districts. Besides long-term measures will be explored to supply drinking water in urban areas. A similar policy will be followed in the case of Greater Kathmandu. By developing alternative uses of water supply situation will be improved during dry seasons. 25. In order to increase people\\'s participation in the selection, implementation and operation of drinking water projects, District Development Committees and Municipalities will be involved. The technical assistance necessary for the init ial phase of a project will be made available from the concerned agencies. Projects to be Implemented by NGOs, Private Entrepreneurs, Firms, Companies and Users NGOs, private entrepreneurs, business firms/companies and consumers play a vital role in the carrying out rural drinking water and sanitation programmes. 1. The NGOs, private enterprises, and business firms/ companies registered at national or district level, and the Users\\' Committee will be encouraged to educate the people at the village level about drinking water and sanitation programmes. 2. Priority will be given to the involvement of NGOs, private enterprises, business firms/companies and the users for carrying out the rural drinking water and sanitation programmes according to demands of the villages or in the areas specified for the purpose by the District Development Committees. 3. While getting the program implemented through NGOs, private entrepre neurs, firms, companies and users, a fixed proportion of the total cost shall be made available to the implementing body as management expenses. 4. The drinking water and sanitation programmes to be implemented by INGOs will have to be consistent with the national programme and the INGOs will have to follow the policies adopted for the purpose. 5. To avoid overlap ping or duplication, of drinking water and sanitation programmes conducted by different INGOs, a system of coordination will be maintained by the Ministry in the same district of Housing and Physical Planning. Basis of Cost-Sharing In view of the high priority given to people\\'s participation in the Eighth Plan, the following arrangements will be made for the users\\' contribution in the total project cost, other than the administrative cost in any project to be carried out in rural areas. 1. In piped drinking water projects the users will be required to bear 10 percent of the total cost in cash, kind or labour. Arrangements for Supervision of Drinking Water Projects Constructed in the Rural Areas The concerned agency will monitor whether or not the local people are receiving drinking water from the projects constructed in the village areas. In this context, it will be mandatory for the concerned agency to prepare a current status report every 6 months and submit it to the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. The objectives of the reporting are to facilitate gradual handing over of the rural projects to the Users\\' Committee and keep the Ministry informed of the actual drinking water situation in the village. Publicity In the Eighth Plan period, various communication media will be used in order to involve maximum number of people in the drinking water and sanitation programmes and get benefitted. In the formulation of the Eighth Plan, a target has been set to gradually provide drinking water facilities to the entire population within the next ten years. Drinking water In the Eighth Plan period, drinking water facilities will be provided to an additional 7,199,000 people (6,756,000 people in rural areas and 443,000 in urban areas). Thus, by the end of the Eighth Plan period, a total of 15,070,000 people (72 percent), -13,455,000 (72 percent) people in rural areas and 1,615,000 (77 percent) in urban areas, will have access to drinking water facilities. Sanitation Programme In the Eighth Plan period, an additional 1,573,000 people (1,159,000 in rural areas and 414,000 in urban areas) will benefit from sanitation facilities. Thus, by the end of the Eighth Plan period, sanitation facilities will be extended to a total of 2,685,000 (13 percent) people, which covers 1,672,000 (9 percent) people in rural areas and 1,013,000 (48 percent) people in urban areas. The details of the drinking water and sanitation programmes is given in the following Table. To achieve the target mentioned above the following programmes will be implemented. Tubewell Programme About 60,559 new shallow tubewells (including artisan wells) and deep-set tubewells will be installed and wells will be constructed in the rural areas of the Terai benefitting a total of 4,057,000 people. Source Protection In various parts of the country traditional springs and other sources are being used for drinking water. In this regard the Eighth Plan has a target of improving 8000 water sources, benefitting 2,68,000 people. On-going Projects An additional 1,404,000 people will be benefitted from the completion of about 500 on-going piped water supply projects. Maintenance and Repair Programme In line with the policy of gradually handing over the completed projects in rural areas to the user\\' Committees, about 240 piped drinking water projects will be repaired and handed over during the Eighth plan period. Projects to be launched in the Eighth Plan and completed in the Ninth Plan. As per the objective of providing drinking water facilities to the entire population within next 10 years, about 1100 projects will be launched in the current plan period. an additional population of 1,027,000. Rehabilitation of Urban-Area Drinking Water Projects In the Eighth Plan period, 28 urban drinking water projects will be rehabilitated and drinking water facility will be provided to an addit ional 360,000 people. Water Supply for Greater Kathmandu In greater Kathmandu (Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur) growth of population, construction of buildings and establishment of industries have all created a big problem in the supply of drinking water. It is estimated that by the end of the fiscal year 1991-92, some 5,70,000 persons out of 6,22,000 persons will be benefitted from the piped drinking water facilities. In the Eighth Plan period, these facilities will be made available to an additional population of 83000, with an aim of covering a total of aboutn 6,53,000 persons by the end of plan period. In addition to this, steps will be taken to increase the reliability of the drinking water supply in Greater Kathmandu. According to a recent estimate, a total of 91.10 M.L.D. (60.34 M.L.D. from surface sources and 30.76 M.L.D. from underground sources), of water is presently being obtained. It appears that by the end of the plan period Greater Kathmandu\\'s actual requirement of 106.09 M.L.D. of water will fall short by 14.99 M.L.D. For meeting this shortage, studies related to alternative sources and means of water supply will be conducted and programmes implemented accordingly. If the 40 percent leakage that is currently taking place in Greater Kathmandu is checked, the supply situation will certainly improve by this will not be possible to achieve immediately. The Eighth Plan target is to cut the 40 percent leakage down to 30 percent so that an additional 9.11 M.L.D. of water is added to the present supply. About I6.53 M.L.D. of water will be made available by the end of the Plan through the construction of new in-takes in the present sources. While supplying drinking water, if enough water can be obtained from surface water bodies, the use of this water will be maximized and the use of underground water will be minimized. This will nelp the recharge of underground water, which will yield an additional 10 M.L.D. of water during dry seasons. Keeping inview drinking water situation of Greater Kathmandu the existing 23 deep-set tubewells will be reconstructed for maintaining balance in the supply of drinking water. To improve the water supply in Greater Kathmandu, be a target has been set to draw water from the Kodku, Roshi, Godavari, Manohara and Nakkhu rivers . Of the proposed projects Kodku, godavari, Monohara and Nakkhu will yield 40, 4, 6 and 5 M.L.D.of water respectively, thus providing additional 55 M.L.D.in total. The projects are scheduled to be completed within the Eighth Plan period. The Roshi project, which will begin in the Eighth Plan period, will yield 30 M.L.D. of drinking water. In addition to these industries located within Kathmandu Valley will be encouraged to relocate outside the valley. The relocation of industries will help reduce pollution inside the valley. Sanitation Programme Keeping in view the human nature of giving attention to personal cleanliness in retrospect with public sanitation, the Eighth Plan has set a target to construct 2000 latrines in school health post and drinking water project premises. It is expected that 20,000 people will benefit from this programme. As women can play a significantly effective role in stimulating the common people towards health education and sanitation, such programmes will, be conducted through female workers. Under this programme 50, DOD private latrines will be constructed, which will provide services to an additional population of 3,00,000. In the urban areas outside Kathmandu Valley a population of 1,00,000 will be served by constructing sewer lines and used water ducts. New and old sewer lines within the valley will be reconstructed and extended, benefitting 2,45,000 people with sanitation facilities. In 9 urban areas outside the valley, about 9,000 low-cost latrines will be constructed. Sanitary facilities will be provided to an additional 6,95,000 people through sanitation programmes carried out by national NGOs and INGOs. Besides, 15,000 latrines connected to bio-gas plants will be constructed through the private sector from which an additional 90,000 people will benefit. Latrines will be constructed in urban areas through the private sector this will provide latrine facilities to an additional population of 69,000. Solid Waste Management and Resource Mobilization Centre Programmes In Greater Kathmandu two additional transport stations, one new sanitary land. fill site and some small compost plants will be developed. Kathmandu and Lalitpur Municipalities will be provided with implements and equipments to be used in the collection, transportation and disposal of filth and garbage. The existing public and mobile latrines will be repaired and their services extended. Besides, in urban areas municipalities as well as local public service associations will be actively involved in the collection of garbage and filth. In other areas municipalities consultancy services and training will be provided in the development of appropriate technologies and management of filth and garbage. The private sector will be encouraged, to participate in resource recovery and recycling as well as in the generation of energy. The concerned agency will provide necessary technical services for these activities. Training Programme For the attainment of the targets set in the Eighth Plan, training programmes for different levels of persons will be conducted. These programmes will cover such themes as institutional development, issues related to the consumer/user, drilling for installation of tubewell and construction of latrine. Research and Development Plan, will focus on the development and extension of technologies related to harvesting of rain water, liner\\'s pump, windmill and use of solar energy and other technologies which can be used in drinking water projects. Also, feasibility studies will be carried out to explore the possibilities of tubewells in valleys and uplands. Long -term District Development Plan In order to expand and select new sources of drinking water in rural areas long-term district-development plan will be implemented in all the 75 districts through respective District Development Committees. In this regard, a list of potential projects in different Village Development Committees will be prepared. Establishment of Laboratory Services Laboratory will be established in all the five Development Regions with the objective of maintaining the quality of drinking water to the required level and monitoring the quality of water from time to time. They will also periodically test the quality of water supplied by private and non-qovernment sectors. Implementation Arrangements In the proposed Eighth Plan, about 60 percent of the targeted programmes in Drinking Water will be implemented by NGOs and the private sector and the remaining 40 percent by government agencies. Similarly, 54 percent of the sanitation programmes will be executed by the private sector and the remaining 46 percent by government bodies. For this the present organizational structure will be modified and made efficient. This will further enhance the professional efficiency of the manpower employed in the government sector. To make the programme implementation aspect effective, emphasis will be given to on regular monitoring during the Eighth Plan. A high-level committee will be constituted in the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, which will design, implement and evaluate drinking water and sanitation programmes launched at national level and coordinate the programme activities of various agencies concerned with drinking water and sanitation. This committee will also decide on the implementation process of drinking water and sanitation programmes launched by NGOs and the private sector. Details of Expenditure It is estimated that a total of Rs6,273 million will be expended on drinking water, sanitation and related programmes during the Eighth Plan period. A description of the expenditure is given in the table below. Housing and Urban Development Introduction Trends in Urbanization The urban population of Nepal appears to have grown at the rate of 5.6 percent per annum during the period 1981-1991. This growth rate is almost three times higher than the annual national growth rate of 2.1 percent. According to the 1991 census report, the population in the municipality areas reached almost 1.7 million, and is estimated to reach 2.9 million by the year 2000 at the current rate of growth. The process of urbanization in areas outside the Kathmandu Valley began in the 1970\\'s. The terai region has witnessed a rapid rise in urban population as compared to other areas since 1971. Several factors have contributed to this growth, namely malaria eradication, deforestation, construction of highways, development in trade, etc. Besides these, incising migration of rural population to city areas has also caused growth in urban population. In the Kathmandu Valley also there has been rapid growth and expansion of cities. Apart from the 36 recognized municipalities in the kingdom, there are also smaller city areas and district headquarters or market places with less than 20,000 population. Some of these centres are already developing into large cities and are beginning to play significant role in urban-rural developments. This trend is likely to be intensified in the future. The Present State of Housing plies accompanying land together with other facilities and basic services. Housing has thus to be considered as the use of available facilities within one\\'s community and as a source of income for the family. For these reasons housing conditions reflect not only the physical facilities enjoyed by individuals but also the economic and social status. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Physical Development in 1991, there are approximately 3 million houses in Nepal. of this three hundred thousand houses are located in municipal areas and 2.7 million in the rural areas. Of the total houses, 50 percent consists of rural huts, 41.7 percent semi-urban constructions and the remaining 8.3 percent permanent structures. Within the city areas in particular, every house is highly occupied and lacks adequate provision of even the minimum facilities such as drinking water and sanitation. Although the majority of families in city areas own houses, it is estimated that about 25 percent of the city dwellers live in rented houses. The problem of landless families is becoming very acute in both the urban and rural areas, especially in various parts of the Terai region. The present estimate is that about cut 7 percent of families live in unauthorised settlements. A close analysis of housing needs reveals a serious nature of the problem, In order to meet the growing housing needs of t he people some 23,000 houses in the urban and 124,000 houses in the rural areas need to be constructed annually during the Eigth Plan period. At present an estimated total of 10,500 new houses are being constructed in the urban areas every year, but this falls for short of the present needs. In the rural areas, houses are being constructed at the rate of about 111,000 per year, and though the shortfall is not as acute as in urban areas the demand for new houses is likely to increase especially in rapidly developing rural areas. But in view of the low economic status of the rural population, a large number of families are not in a position to provide for their basic housing needs. The current growth in housing facilities has, therefore, been mainly confined to the middle class and upper class families. Existing state of the Housing Sector While a large amount of money has been invested in buildings under Government ownership, many government offices continue to bear big financial burden due to the compulsion of staying in rented buildings. The Department of Housing along with a network of 75 district offices across the country has so far been carrying out the work of designing, constructing and maintaining or repairing government buildings, places of historical and cultural importance, and providing public service facilities in these sites. Progress during the Seventh Plan Urban Development During the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, the efforts made to develop the regional development centres (Dhankuta, Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Surkhet and Dipayal) were aimed at environmental protection, development of physical facilities, optimal land use, social welfare schemes such as employee housing, preservation of archaeological sites and housing development projects, particularly in the Kathmandu Valley. The plan for the physical development for all municipalities were prepared, and municipallevel and district-level employees were trained. A Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning was established to consolidate and co-ordinate housing and physical development activities in the urban areas. The Department of Housing and Physical Planning was abolished and two separate Departments, namely, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Building were established. The Department of Water Supply was brought under the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. With a view to improving sanitation and Water-Supply systems in the city areas a Water-Supply and sewerage Corporation was established. A Division of urban development was also created within -the Ministry for Local Development. The Local Development Training Centre at Pokhara was converted into Local and Urban Development Training Centre to train civil servants. The existing laws relating to urban development were replaced by municipal development law, 1988/89. The Kathmandu Valley Development Authority Act 1988/89 was also prepared to expedite the development of the Valley through an Authority. Technical assistance was provided to the local administrative units for preparing development plans. A Town Development Fund was set up in 1988/89 to provide loan assistance to various municipalities. His Majesty\\'s Government also provided loan assistance to some municipalities for implementing the land development programmes. Housing A total loan assistance of 35 million rupees was made available to the Town Development Committees of Dipayal, Bharatpur, Lahan, Jaleswar, and for housing development projects in the Dhulikhel municipality. Directed Land Development Projects were also implemented in the designated areas of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and a few other municipalities. The Nepal Resettlement Company has been re-mamed as the Rural Housing and Settlement Development Company. This company is presently preparing various programmes and plans in order to be economically self-sustaining within a few years. Progress made during the Fiscal Years 1990191 and 1991/92 During the fiscal year 1990/91 a pilot survey of housing was completed with the UNDP assistance in order to determine the current housing condition and its growth. This survey made a detailed study of the process in land development, availability of building materials and various other aspects of housing. A financial company with a capital of Rs3 million was established to mobilize private resources for the development of housing projects. During the fiscal year 1991/92, the survey on housing condition carried out in the previous year was analyzed and a draft of the national housing policy was prepared. Besides these, a long-term technical programme was drawn up to solve the problems likely to crop up in housing, urban development and settlements. Similarly, the Rural Housing and village Development Company made available 110 hectares of land in some districts of the Terai region. In the fiscal year 1990/91 under the Singh Darbur Reconstruction Project, the first floor-of the Ministry of Housing and Physical Development and the Ministry of Tourism were constructed along with the initiation of construction of buildings for the Ministry of Industry. During the fiscal year 1991/92 the building of the Ministry of Industry was completed and the second floor of the Ministry of Housing and Physical Development and the Ministry of Tourism are also constructed. The construction of an International Conference Centre building began in the fiscal year 1989/90 with the economic and technical assistance from the Chinese government, and the basic framework of the building was completed in the following year. During this period, the Nepalese side also began the construction of the security guard house and the garage which were completed in the fiscal year 1991/92. By this time, the Chinese side also completed about 90 percent of the main building and its essential requisites. During the fiscal year 1990/91 various construction and maintenance works were carried out under the programme of preserving and improving the areas of religious and cultural importance in the Kathmandu Valley. In the fiscal year 1991/92 various improvement works such as protection of botanical garden the construction of toilet facilities and compound walls were carried out at the religious sites of Seshnarayan temple and Changunarayan temples, and improvement of physical facilities were made as per the target around the religious site of Changunarayan temple. Under the programme for reconstruction of earthquake affected areas, a housing loan scheme and school building reconstruction works were carried out in the fiscal year 1990/91. During the year 322 two-room school blocks were constructed and building materials were provided for 488 Blocks. In the fiscal year 1991/92 additional 795 two-room school buildings were constructed with public support, and the task of collecting building materials is underway for the next fiscal year. Existing Problems Problems relating to Essential Urban services Due to limited resources of the central and local bodies, it has been quite a problem to provide adequate services  in the field of water supply, road transport, sewage and sanitation, health, and education. In addition to these, new problems such as increase in traffic congestion, environment and water pollution, inadequate housing, increase in crime rate and illegal settlements in public land have alos cropped up. It will, therefore, be difficult in the coming years to fulfil the existing needs and those that are likely to arise in the- future. The rural areas of Nepal have also come under pressure of increasing population as well as social, economic and environmental problems. The municipalities will have to provide housing, employment, training and other basic facilities semiskilled to the rural poor migrating to city areas in large numbers. In these circumstances the long-term solution to the development problems would be organized management of urban development potentialities and carrying out of urban development activities as supplement of rural development. Problems relating to Housing Housing Companies There are as yet no housing companies or Corporations at the public or private sector in Nepal. Every individual makes his own financial arrangement, buys the land, procures building materials and supervises the construction of his house. In the rural areas, one\\'s own family members, relatives and neighbours assist in the construction work. Houses are often constructed by stages according to the owner\\'s economic apacity. It is now a common practice in the city areas to supplement the family income by renting out the house or rooms. Land for Housing The price of land in the city areas and some of the rapidly developing rural centres has continued rise sharply in recent years. This has made it increasingly difficult for the common people to acquire land for housing. Loan for Housing According to a recent study it is evident that an average family requires many years before it can accumulate resources to buy land and materials for constructing a house. There are as yet no.government or private financial agencies to provide loan for housing, nor are there any saving schemes specifically for housing purpose. Essential Public Services and Community Environment Building Materials and Construction Technique The building materials presently being used in Nepal need to be less expensive, more durable and less likely to cause environmental pollution. Besid es the use of less expensive construction techniques, it is also necessary to develop materials that can withstand natural disasters. Housing and Poverty Alleviation Housing is not only the need of the poor and low-income group of people but also one of the basic pre-requisite for getting out of the vicious circle of poverty. The ownership house makes it convenient to carryout income generating activities in both the rural and urban areas. Problems Relating to Building Construction and Maintenance The construction of a building requires a large financial investment. This is mainly due to the wide use of imported building materials, transportation cost of materials, design requirements, etc. The buildings constructed with such materials and design usually entail further expenses in periodic maintenance and repair for maintaining their durability. There is no up-to-date reliable data on how many buildings are owned by His Majesty\\'s Government, what their physical designs are, where these are located and how safe they are against natural disasters. When constructing government buildings we need to make use of local resources and materials, and take steps to make these buildings safer than they presently are against natural disasters by improving construction techniques. Background of the Eighth Plan The process of rapid urbanization that has taken place from the last decade can neither be halt ed nor altered. This process should not be viewed merely as a physical development but more as a contributing factor in national economy and national unity. Hence there is a need to move ahead by consolidating the positive aspects of urbanization. Urbanization is a process which gets initiated and accelerated with the active participation of the private sector. But the structure and quality of urbanization are influenced by the country\\'s physical infrastructure and financial policies. The development of cit y centre can contribute to the growth of quality services in the neighbouring rural areas, and at the same time generate employment opportunities in modern industries and services. A close review of the housing sector does not reveal a deplorable situation in rural areas. But when viewed objectively from quality aspect it is imperative gradually to improve rural housing system. Furthermore, economic and physical problems are growing in areas settled by people displaced by natural disasters or low productivity of land. In the case of urban areas the problem of housing is becoming more acute day by day. This can be seen in the unplanned construction of houses, the lack of essential services and the high cost of residential land as compared to average income of city people. Although housing is largely a private enterprise, the government, however, would need to adopt certain policy measures to support and coordinate the individual effort while keeping intact the supreme role of the private sector and individuals . Objectives 1. To promote urban development as a complementary process to rural development in view of the need to develop urban-rural interlinkages as well as the need for balanced regional development. 2. To promote planned in urban development and management of urban areas by making the process of urbanization complementary to the development of local economy. 3. To increase the construction of new houses and to upgrade the quality of the existing houses by making more land and financial resources available. 4. To raise the investment capability of HMG by using local skills and materials, and adopting low cost designs and improved costruction technologies. 5. To adopt designing and construction practices that can create employment opportunities and support local economy. 6. To improve the quality standard of government buildings for their protection against natural disasters like earthquake, flood, landslide, hurricane, fire, etc. Policies 1. Appropriate policies and programmes will be formulated and implemented to solve problems encountered in the planned development of urban settlements and to address increasing problems of environment degradation. 2. Urban development will be integrated with infrastructure development with the objective of increasing economic and employment opportunities in the industrial sector. The relationship between towns and villages will be. improved by developing small townships and market center. 3. Environmental protection will be ensured in urban areas by (a) formulating regulations for land use, waste disposal, sanitation etc; (b) enacting laws for prevention and control of act, water and noise pollution; and (c) providing investment fund to improve and develop existing infrastructure. 4. Places of historical, cultural and archaeological importance will be protect ed and conserved by adopting appropriate measures. 5. Communities will be directly involved from the very beginning in the planned urban development. 6. Non-governmental organizations and the private sector will be encouraged to invest in urban development programmes. 7. In the areas where the private sector is shy to participate, the government will carry out pilot projects as demonstrations or encourage private sector so as to create a healthy process of urban deve lopment. 8. A land development program will be carried out through the private entrepreneurs and Housing Development companies in order to provide housing plots to the poor families in rural as well as urban areas. The land so developed will be provided with the basic physical and social facilities, and unified settlement programe will be implemented in these areas., The Housing companies will also be encouraged to provide services relating to residential land to families of different income groups. 9. Skill development opportunities will be given to the construction entrepreneurs in the rural areas to use improved construction techniques for building better houses with locally available manpower and materials. 10. Suitable measures will be taken to make housing loans available to Housing Development Companies and private finance companies through banks. 11. Local administrative bodies and municipalities will be assisted in the formulation and enforcement of rules and regulations relating to house constructions. 12. The genuine landless households will be identified and housing plots will be made available to them. For this purpose, land will be made available out of barren land, government forest areas and the excess land obtained from land ceiling under the Land Reform Act. 13. As the cost of maintenance and repair of existing buildings will be lower than the construction of new houses, the government will provide technical assistance for this purpose. 14. Research studies will be carried out to upgrade the quality of construction materials and techniques in order to improve the quality of residential buildings and reduce construction costs. 15. Since housing is an essential need of all citizens, the government will adopt an appropriate strategy of making housing facilities available to a maximum number of people rather than emphasizing on providing superior quality services. 16. Financial resources of the private sector will be mobilized in an organized manner and investment in the housing sector will be increased. This will increase the national saving rate and total national investible fund. 17. The bodies under the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning will provide necessary technical as well as managerial advice and skills to the municipalities, as well as individuals and organizations in the private sector institutionally capability of implementing housing programmes. 18. A national building code including the norms and specification standards will be formulated as guidelines for all building constructions in the country. 19. The design and construction of national level government buildings will be carried out by the Department of Housing, which is the central body in the construction of government buildings. 20. The local masons and craftsmen will be trained so as to make them capable of adopting improved engineering techniques that safeguard buildings against natural disasters. Targets and Programmes Urban Development Assistance to Municipalities Under the recently enacted Municipality Act 1992, municipalities will be provided with technical assistance, training and programme development orientation in order to raise the organizational capability of municipal bodies in town development. A Town Development Fund Committee has also been set up to provide financial resources to the development programmes being implemented by municipalities. This fund will provide loan or grant assistance to municipalities for implementing growth oriented and revenue-generating projects. Such loans or grants will be made available to municipalities to carry out development protection and expansion of infrastructure in urban areas. Development of Market centres An outline of inter-ministerial development programme will be prepared on the basis of survey studies of different areas identifying their potentials for development as business centers. During the Eighth Plan period seven such areas will be selected for development in different geographical regions. In addition to these, studies will be made to develop 29 district headqu arters including Kohalpur, Atariya and Birtamod that are not recognized as municipalities as service centres. For this programmes aimed at assessing the current state of environment pollution, maintaining quality standerise, formulating rules and raising public awareness towards sanitation, waste disposal and air, water and noise pollution, land use and public places will be carried out. This program will be implemented in 15 principal municipalities of the kingdom, Greater Janakpur Area Development Project Under this project all the places of historical, religious\\' and archaeologicalimportance in the Janakpur area will first be identified and phase-wise measures will be taken to preserve and improve them with the objective of developing the Greater Janakpur Area as a tourism center. The development activities of this plan will be carried out in three phases. During the first phase a network of main roads and feeder roads will be constructed to connect relig ious places and to improve transport services within the Janakpur municipality. In the second phase, programmes related to development protection and promotion of infrastructure necessary for the socio -economic development of the area will be carried out. The third phase will seek to consolidate and strengthen developmental activities with particular emphasis on the protection and promotion of areas of religious and cultural importance. Kathmandu Valley city Development A program will be implemented to provide necessary prerequisites and create a healthy environment in order to develop city areas in Kathmandu valley in a planned and systematic manner. Institutional Development Although there is no reliable data on the number of landless individuals or families, this has emerged as a. major problem and hence such landless people will be provided with employment opportunities and housing plots. This programme will be supported by other programmes oriented towards social welfare and provision of loans. Furthermore, the programme will avoid settlement in areas that are environmentally unsuitable, and also assist in moving people from such areas to other places. In carrying out these tasks, attempts will be made to raise the expenses incurred from the settlers themselves depending on their economic condition. During the Eighth Plan period, some 25,000 families will be provided settlement facilities in coordination with the poverty alleviation program. Urban Land Development Among the families living in urban areas, it is how almost impossible for the low income groups to buy housing plot for building houses. For this reason, a plan will be implemented to develop housing land with the minimum of basic facilities. In this programme, however, the required money will be collected from the users. on a long term basis. This programme will cover (a) municipal areas; (b) district headquarters with such needs, and (c) 7,000 plots of land to be developed under the Housing and Public Services programme in market centres. The capability of existing financial institutions to extend housing loans will be increased. This will benefit individuals and companies involved in land and housing development. In addition to this, other sources of loan, particularly cooperative loan schemes will also be utilized. Such loans schemes will also be extended to income and employment generating projects, besides housing. A revolving fund will also be established to support land development activities. This fund will provide working capital loans to municipalities, and government as well as non-government agencies engaged in housing and land development. Formulation of Act and Regulations The existing laws relating to Housing and Land Development will be revised and necessary laws will be enacted  to regulate sale and purchase of land, construction of buildings, land tax, construction of houses for rent, ownership of multi-storied buildings, etc. These acts and regulations will be prepared with the objective of complementing the efforts of local bodies in resolving the housing problems. Improvement in Urban Housing It is less expensive to repair and maintain existing houses than to build new ones. The program of housing improvement will include expansion of water supply, sanitation and healthy environment in and around house premises. In the low-income group areas these works will be carried out through co-operative schemes. it is estimated that 15,000 families will benefit from this programme during the Eighth Plan. The national policy on Housing will be finalized, and attempts will be made to strengthen institutional capability of concerned bodies and co-ordination mechanism for gradual implementation of the policy. Construction of Buildings and Maintenance The Singha Durbar Secretariat Re-construction Plan The Singh Durbar Reconstruction Plan is under implementation to rebuild the Secretariat partially destroyed by fire on July 9, 1973 with the exterior in its original design and the interior with modern renovations as the apex administrative center of Nepal by bringing together in one building complex all the Ministries and Departments of HMG which are housed in various buildings around the Valley construct roads, footpaths , drainage system, etc. as well as buildings for banks, post office and library withing the premise of Singh Durbar During the current plan period in addition to construction of buildings to house the Min istry of Housing and Physical Development, and Ministry of Tourism and construction work of buildings for the ministries of Forest and Environment, Defence, Labour and Social Welfare, and Education and Culture will also be initated. Construction of Quarters for Ministers and Heads of Constitutional Bodies Under this project five more buildings within the premise of the present ministers\\' quarters, and 11 buildings near the Prime Minister\\'s official residence are planned to be constructed. International Conference Building The construction of this building initiated in the fiscal year 1989/90 with the assistance from the Chinese government is expected to be completed in the fiscal year 1992/93. Project on Building Materials Research and Code Attempts will be made to identify and develop low cost and pollution neutral building materials which will suit with the traditional construction techniques and also contribute to their development. At the same time, new construction techniques which are less prone to natu ral disasters will be adopted. In carrying out these tasks, priority will be given to the use of locally available construction materials. Attention will be given to disseminate the knowledge and skills thus acquired to individual households and communities taking the responsibility of house construction. Project on the Development of the Cultural and Religious Areas of Kathmandu Valley This -project will be implemented to preserve and maintain various areas of cultural and religious importance in the Kathma ndu Valley together with measures to protect its environment. This project has a target of preservation and maintaining 14 such religious places. Project on Re-construction and Rehabilitation of Earthquake Affected Areas This project has been implemented with a loan assistance from the World Bank to carry out re-construction works for and rehabilitation of families, organisations, and institutions affected by the earthquake of 1988. Under this project structural improvement of buildings and re-construction of schools are being carried out. The project has a plan of reconstructing 6677 two-room school blocks in the 29 districts of the Eastern and Central regions. Basic and Primary Education Project This project will be implemented with a loan assistance from the World Bank to upgrade the- quality and standard of primary education in 40 districts. Under this project construction works will be carried out by drawing-up of design plans and supervising construction works. Implementation Arrangements There are provisions for providing loans and grants to municipalities from the Urban Development Fund to implement developmental works and to initiate income -generating schemes. The programme of providing settlement to the landless people will be carried out through the Rural Housing and Village Development Company. In this programme various private and non-government organizations will also be involved. Appropriate steps will be taken to encourage banks to provide housing loans to Housing Development and other private financial companies. Details of Expenditure During the Eighth Plan period a total of 2304 million rupees has been earmarked to implement various \\'programmes through the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. Labour and Social Welfare Introduction The pressure of increasing population on limited cultivatable land has caused large-scale unemployment in the agricultural sector. This imbalance between the increase in labour force and lack of job opportunities indicates an under-developed state of the agricultural sector. While many unskilled labourers are compelled to migrate to foreign countries for low-paid jobs, we have not been able to produce more skilled workers as required. In view of the annual incre ase of workers in the labour market, it is important that we take necessary measures to provide appropriate skills to workers in order to create higher rate of employment opportunities in agricultural as well as nonagricultural sectors and safeguard their interests through reforms in management and thus mobilise the available labour force for the development of the country. According to preliminary estimates, the statistics on Nepal\\'s labour and employment situation are as follows: Progress during the Seventh Plan During the Seventh Plan period various basic training programmes for non-agricultural sectors were conducted to create employment opportunities. Within this period 7 labour organizations trained a total of 6114 workers in building, carpentry, sewing, weaving, knitting and other skills. The Vocational and Industrial Training Project has also provided training to 737 persons in mechanical skills and ,hair cutting/hair care. Various study and task force groups collected information and data on the classification of labourers by profession, employment statistics in one area, the effectiveness of training programs conducted by 11 Labour supply Training Centres, preparation of curricula on 6 subject areas, and field research on employment and skill development potentialities in 6 remote areas. A survey was also conducted under the Labour and Employment Services Programme which recorded 1,053 unemployed persons, 763 were given training in various skills, compiled the names of non-Nepali workers and acquired information on job vacancies. Within this plan period 9 firms were also registered to regulate and better organize the foreign employment services. A feasibility study was carried out to establish a Labour and Employment Centre in one Development Zone. Progress during the Fiscal Years 1990/91 and 1991/92 The 7 Labour Supply centres under the Department of Labour trained 1,881 persons in sewing, weaving, carpentry, building, electrical fittings, machine operation, mechanics, hair care etc. The project on Labour and Employment Research also carried out surveys in 5 districts on the labour market conditions including collection of data and information on the adequacy of workers in the building sector, the effectiveness of training in  electrical skills and the number of job vacancies in industrial enterprises. A Vocational Training Centre building was constructed at Rani, Biratnagar. Although various projects in the labour sector have been carried out since the Fifth Plan, there are still a number  of problems such as the country\\'s low rate of economic development with corresponding inability to create new jobs, lack of co-ordination between employment -policy and its implementation, absence of reliable statistical information on the labour situation and a shortage of basic -skill manpower in the country. There is also the lack of consistent policy and regulations for foreign employment. During the previous plan periods, attempts were made merely to fulfil the immediate needs of government departments, and the labour organizations lacked adequate resources and training facilities. The laws relating to labour could not be fully implemented as envisaged. Background of the Eighth Plan As the mobilization of the available skilled labour force is precondition for the country\\'s development, it is, therefore, imperative that they be properly trained and provided with opportunities for jobs and their standard of living be improved. The Eighth Plan has formulated policies and programmes to mobilize the workers for employment within and outside the country. objectives 1. To bring about a gradual reduction in full and partial unemployment by maintaining a balance between the demand and supply of the labour force. 2. To produce skilled workers required for development activities. 3. To create appropriate conditions for increasing employment opportunities at home and abroad. 4. To safeguard the basic rights of labourers in a more effective manner. Priorities a. To provide training in basic skills. b. To develop skills that are productive and employmentoriented. C., \\tTo encourage industries that make use of the country\\'s raw materials and its technical skills. d. \\tTo implement the Labour Act 1992. e. \\tTo org anise training programmes for labourers of backward ethnic communities and in the remote areas. Policy 1. Further investments will be mobilized from the government and the private sector -on productive enterprises to provide more employment and selfemployment opportunities to the presently unemployed and partially unemployed workers in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. As the country has an adequate labour force, policy measures will be adopted for the development of appropriate technologies capable of making greater use of these labourers in agricultural and non-agricultural jobs. 2. As agriculture has the highest potential for using labour productively in the short-term, priority will be given to diversification and intensive development of this sector. 3. Basic vocational training will be given to the rural population in order to develop skilled manpower. The government will assist such trained workers to be self-employed or to obtain institutionalised jobs elsewhere. This mobilization will include planned training programmes to improve the productive capacity of various workers and also to organise efficient management. 5. The organizational and legal provisions will be made to systematise the service conditions of all employees. The Nepali workers will also be offered job opportunities in foreign countries, and the regulations governing such ser vices will be improved for the welfare of the workers. 6. The physical and administrative aspects of Labour Welfare centres will be improved in order to mobilize local workers more effectively. In line with this objective, priority will be given to training women workers and helping them learn new skills for employment in the non-agricultural sector. 7. Programmes relating to public works and social welfare activities will be expanded to improve the quality and to absorb larger quantity of the rural labour force. 8. Loan facilities and other assistance will be provided for those who wish to start their own occupational schemes. 9. Technical or financial support will be made available to labour- intensive sectors where opportunities of self-employment schemes can be increased. 10. As a long-term measure, family planning services will be provided in an organized manner to maintain the potential labour force in the country to a manageable size. 13. Policy measures will be taken to provide incentives such as tax rebate to employers who invest on the skill development of their workers. Targets and Programmes The following programmes will be implemented within the Eighth Plan to fulfil the above mentioned policy objectives. 1. Labour Supply centres The Labour Welfare centres have been established to promote professional skills in workers in order to increase their productive capacity. The Eighth Plan aims to train some 9,925 workers through Labour Supply centres in Jhapa, Itahari, Hetauda, Butwal, Pokhara, Nepalganj, Dhangadhi, Dang and Mahendranagar in various skills such as masonry, carpentry, sewing, weaving cane-bamboo works etc. Four new Labour Supply centres will be established at Janakpur, -,Bag lung, Rajbiraj and Jumla. one such centre will be added each fiscal year from the second year of the current plan. These additional centres aim to train further 1,200 workers. 2. Industrial and Vocational Training The Vocational Training Centre at Rani, Biratnagar plans to conduct a one-year training programme in metal trade of Mechanical Engineering to 150 persons within the Eighth Plan period. The Vocational Training Project at Kathmandu also plans to train 500 persons in hair cutting/hair care, sewing, knitting, carpet weaving, driving and leather craft. 3. Employment Research Exchange and Extension Project The current plan aims to carry out various research and promotion programmes including the collection of information on the labour market in 50 districts, feasibility studies on the promotion of skilled labour in the districts of inner Tarai, assessment of the effectiveness of training programmes conducted by Labour Welfare Centres in 10 subject areas, preparation of curricula for 5 subjects, collection of information on job vacancies in industrial enterprises established in 10 districts, registration of unemployed persons, promotion of employment in established industries and provision of guiding and counselling services. 4. Employment Promotion The current plan aims to prepare and enact legal provisions for the improvement of Labour Supply centres and Vocational Training centres on the basis of a review of the existing industrial training programmes. The Labour Act 1992 will also be implemented and evaluated with legal and administrative support. 5. Skill Development Training Programme A total of 10,000 persons will be given basic training to develop skills and efficiency among local workers. 6. Project on the Consolidation of Vocational Health and safety Measures in Industries Under this programme the laws relating to vocational health and safety will be reviewed with necessary suggestions. Further, the safety and health standards of workers will be determined, various training programmes will be assessed through regular inspection and testing, and a Central Industrial Health Laboratory will be established within the Eighth Plan period. 7. Consolidation and Dissemination of the Labour Market Information The training programmes will need to be regulated to imp rove the unemployment situation in the country and to provide training in such skills that are in demand in the labour market. The current plan has included this programme of information resource in order to train and recommend workers for employment. Under this programme the Department of Labour will disseminate information on the district-level labour market to the concerned consumers. Social Welfare Introduction Social Welfare is an important sector that contributes to the acceleration of the overall development programme of the country. The social welfare activities thus need to be strengthened to raise the living standards of the socially and economically backward people so that they can participate more fully in the development of the country. The progress made in social welfare programmes will directly benefit the poor and deprived people by providing them with social and economic security. On the other hand, such programs can help to promote public awareness against social problems and evils like increase in crime, undesirable social practices and blind beliefs. Programmes on social welfare can also contribute to development of local-oriented skills and mobilization of resources and manpower for development activities. -Since the communities living in different geographical areas of the country have different needs and problems, it is necessary to prepare and organize social welfare programmes that are appropriate to local conditions. Such programmes have been conducted by various social organizations independently, but with the establishment of the Social Services National Coordination Council in 1977 attempts are being made to institutionalize and co-ordinate the social welfare sector. Following the establishment of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare during the second year of the Sixth Plan in 1981, policy guidelines and programmes in the social welfare sector have been implemented as an integral part of the country\\'s development. Further, various non-governmental organisations have also carried out community development projects under the auspices of the Social Services National Co-ordination Council (SSNCC). Progress during the Seventh Plan a. Government Sector During the Seventh Plan period 10 social welfare programmes were conducted in the areas of training, research and workshop/seminars. In the field of training, 470 women from the backward communities of Deuki, Vadi and other less privileged people were trained in various skills. A total of 1,843 students from the Oche, Macaw, Chepang and C communities were provided with scholarships under the Social Security Scholarship Award programme. With a view to bringing about social reforms, a total of 13 seminars were organized on the evils of undesirable social practices. A Central Division for Women\\'s Development was established during the fourth year of the Seventh Plan under this ministry to co-ordinate inter-regional activities and programmes in women\\'s development in various parts of the country. This Division made assessments of women development programmes in the fields of agriculture, forestry, local development, industries, education and health which were conducted by the concerned ministries. Local Development Introduction Attempts have been made since the Third Plan period to raise the living standard of the general public by meeting their basic needs, and by developing leadership qualities, skills and resources for local development. But thes e attempts have not been successful largely because these were merely confined to slogans rather than to effective implementation. For the success of any local development programmes. The local people themselves need to be involved more actively both at the planning and execution levels. As both the producers and users communities consulted the primary agents of local development they need to be provided with financial and technical support and also the discretionary power by creating suitable environment. In the present context, programmes to be implemented under local development will need to the oriented towards raising living standard of poor communities, developing backward areas, establishing new public infrastructure or maintaing the existing ones, helping people to attain self-reliance in the supplies of food- grains and fuel- resources, and creating employment opportunities in the local areas. Progress during the Seventh Plan The progress status of some of these programmes as follows: The six Local Development Training Centers in Jhapa, Janakpur, Jiri, Jawalakhel, Pokhara and Nepalgunj had planned to conduct seminars and train 25,002 persons during the Seventh Plan, but the actual achievement was training 16,502 persons. Similarly, the five Women\\'s Training Centers in Dhankuta, Jawalakhel, Pokhara, Surkhet and Dipayal had a target of training 4395 women but a total of 5447 women were trained during the period. Among the 200 projects on drinking water, school, housing and\\' others \\'that were implemented under the Remote Area Development Programme, 37 drinking water projects were completed, benefitting some 8 thousand people. As regards irrigation, as against the target of irrigating 300 hectares of land, only 255 hectares were irrigated. Regarding the target of constructing 65 suspension bridges, only 41 were constructed. Similarly, of the target of constructing 300 kilometers of mule-track only 200 kilometers were constructed. The Ministry of Local Development was able to implement Women\\'s Development Programmes aimed at upgrading the socio -economic conditions of the rural women in 49 districts by the end of seventh plan. One of the activities under this programme consisted of a household survey of 30,367 women for initiating income generating programmes. Out of the total surveyed women, 2,263 women groups, were formed covering 10,188 family members. Some 239 thousand women were benefitted by various community development programmes, and 10 thousand women benefited from loan facility of 29 million and 383 thousand rupees made available by various banks for agriculture, 1 livestock, cottage industries and service business;. The Ministry of Local Development provided zinc sheet roofing materials to .6,040 schools during the \\'Seventh Plan period. Several programmes under Integrated Rural Development Project, Praja Community Development Scheme, Bhaktapur Development Project, Banepa and Dhulikhel Development Project, Population Education Programme, etc. were other local development projects implemented during this period. Progress during the fiscal years 1990/91 and 1991/92 During the fiscal year 1990/91 a total of 3,305 men and women were trained out of the targeted figure of 3,443 persons. Similarly, a total of 2,396 persons were trained during the fiscal year 1991/92 out of the targeted figure of 2,756 persons. in addition, 726 persons were trained in various fields such as environment conservation, animal husbandry, horticulture, grain storage, bee- keeping, etc., under various Integrated Rural Development Projects. Regarding -irrigation, 20 hectares of land were brought under -irrigation out of the targeted area of 30 hectares. it is estimated that some 10 thousand people have benefited by the construction of, 12 out of 16 suspension bridges. During the fiscal year 1991/92, 34 out 40 drinking water supply projects are expected to have been completed, which will benefit some 7 thousand people. out of 18 irrigation projects targeted, 15 are completed irrigating about 100 hectares of land. During the year, 7 out of 14 targeted suspension bridges are expected to be built, and 12 out of the target of 15 kilometres of mule-tracks roads are expected to be completed. During the fiscal year 1990/91, under the Women Development Programme a household survey of 6,650 women was conducted for income generating activities and 752 loan groups were formed, covering 4,949 family members. The Community Development Programmes benefited some 13 thousand people, and about 11 thousand people were given training in different fields. Similarly, in the fiscal year 1991/92 a total of 6,867 households were surveyed for income generating activities and they were grouped into 803 loan groups, covering 4,915 women. It is estimated that a loan of about 5 million and 720 thousand rupees have been made available to these groups. The Community Development Programme benefited some 17 thousand people and more than 15 thousand people participated in various training programs. Under the school roofing programme, a total of 1,446 school buildings were provided with roofing materials during the fiscal year 1990/91, and it is estimated that 1,500 schools will receive this facility during the fiscal year 1991/92. During these fiscal years, various projects including agriculture, education, drinking water, forest development, settlement of landless people, health, cottage industries etc. are being implemented under the Praja Community Development Programme. Existing Problems Despite the planned efforts made during the past decades to speed up the process of development and reduce  the extent of poverty in the country, the actual outcome has been very disappointing. The fact that Nepal is ranked as one of world\\'s least developed countries with a large segment of its people living below the poverty -line is a clear indication of wide-spread poverty in the country. The previous rural development programmes were prepared from the Center with the objective of achieving target growth in overall production. As the rural development programmes were implemented without the participation of local people, the benefits did not  percolate down to the intended section of the people. The excessive control of the Center over local development programmes led to ineffective implementation due mainly to the lack of local initiation and enthusiasm. Although the policy of decentralization was advocated in implementing these programmes, administrative and financial aspects could not be decentralized. Control of almost all the local development programmes by the Center made the local bodies virtually powerless. This centralized nature of administrative system together with its highly bureaucratic practice has alienated the general public to a status of ruler-ruled relationship instead of civil servantscitizens relationship. This tendency to centralize the authority of the bureaucratic system together with its dependence on political patronage and lack of commitment and service-motive towards the people made it difficult for the government to render timely services to the people. The lack of clear cut policy guidelines, contradictory policies and the absence of public participation in financial management and programme implementation not only raised the cost of implementation but also reduced the quality of its services. The lack of integration of local bodies, the Integrated Rural Development programmes and other projects with the local Training Centers resulted in the unci-ordinated training activities. One of the main factors for the failure of the previous rural development efforts was faulty programming. When preparing a programme, little attention was given to balanced investment on a regional basis. Furthermore, there were no attempts to mobilize local resources and manpower and that the programme entirely depended on external aid. As a consequence the programmes failed to create the required base for self reliant and sustainable development. It will be necessary under these circumstances to conduct training programmes with the view of producing the manpower required for local development projects, improving the efficiency of officials and training local leaders and social workers to make them more responsive to development efforts. Special efforts will have to be made to develop the socio-economic conditions of people living in the northern parts of the country and other backward communities so that they can participate more fully in the process of national development. Background of the Eighth Plan One of the main objectives of the Eighth Plan will be to raise the living standard of the rural population and to overcome their economic backwardness. In order to achieve this goal, all the efforts to be made by the  government in economic, political, social, cultural, religious and educational sectary will be focussed on fulfilling  the local needs. The past experiences have shown that substantial development cannot take place without effective implementation of programmes right from the initial stage. For this reason, the participation of local people will be encouraged in project planning and implementation and sharing of benefits. In line with this approach, HMG will adopt effective policy of decentralization with regard to political, economic and administrative matters and bring about better co-operation and co-ordination among local political organizations, private and non-government organizations and farmers or other community organizations. In this context, the old organizational structures will be revived and geared more fully in local development activities. Objectives 1. To improve the economic and social conditions of backward regions. 2. To make rural families self-reliant by improving their socio -economic conditions.. 3. To upgrade the socio-economic status of the rural population and deprived backward communities. maximizing peoples, participation in rural development works. 5. To develop the basic infrastructure in the rural areas. 6. To increase employment opportunities. in the rural areas. 7. To reduce regional and ecological imbalances. Policies 1. Rural Development Programme will be carried out with the active participation of local bodies. 2. \\tprogrammes will be oriented towards the development of rural infrastructure such as, rural transportation, irrigation, water-supply, school buildings, health-posts, small hydroelectric projects, etc. Rural development 3. Productivity of production, activities generating income as well as employment opportunities will be increased with the maximum mobilization of available resources, skills and technology in order to fulfil the felt needs of the local people. 4. Special socio-economic programmes will be launched for the well-being of socially and economically weaker sections -of the -rural population, ethnic tribes and women. District-level line agencies or project offices will be instructed to compulsorily set targets that can directly - benefit the deprived members of the community, while preparing the annual development programme. 5. Women\\'s Development Programme will be integrated with the programme of District Development Committee, and women\\'s self-reliance institutions will be promoted. 6. Non-government organizations will be encouraged in programmes that will directly benefit the target groups, with HMG will playing only a supportive role. Directions will be given to these organizations to avoid no. 1 duplication in programmes and make the programmes complementary to each other. 7. Necessary manpower, resources, and technical support will the provided to local bodies in order to enable them to effectively implement and manage development programmes; and the existing Training Centers will be strengthened to effectively conduct training programmes. 8. In order to improve ecological unbalance, local level programmes will be carried out with due consideration to environmental conservation. 9. Use of local technologies will be encouraged in local development works and programmes will be launched to increase production, and productivity and employment opportunities by exploring and making use of local resources and technologies. 10. Arrangements will be made to provide a block grant by exploring and making use of appropriate technology local development works on the basis of appropriate criteria and keeping in view the availability of local resources. 11. Local peoples participation will the increased in the implementation of production oriented and rural service programmes by involving them right from the project formulation stage and by revitalizing local users\\' committees. 12. Arrangements will be made for job security, career development and training, of field level staff in order to increase their motivation towards work. 13. Special emphasis will be given to update the collection and processing of local data in order to formulate district level programmes as per local need. It will be made compulsory to use collected data in the formulation of plans. 14. All local-level development activities will be made transparent and their financial transactions will be audited. Targets and Programmes The Eighth Plan will implement a two-tier programme at the village- level and the family-level for rural development. The village-level programme will focus on the development of physical and institutional infrastructure including the construction of roads, bridges, schools, drinking water and irrigation schemes, health posts etc. These programmes are expected to support the socio -economic development of local areas and also benefit the poor directly or indirectly. Since the village-level programmes cannot fulfil the felt needs of poor families, a targeted programme will be implamented. under this program, various schemes such as production loan, training, employment, education of children, mother and child nutrition, etc. will be carried out on individual as well as group basis. The participation of local organizations will be increased while formulating and implementing all types of village-level programmes. For this the capability of local organizations to formulate and carry out plans and programmes will be strengthened. It is evident that the private and non-government organizations are more effective in carrying out development programms from the view point of flexibility, cost-effectiveness and initiative. In the present democratic context, HMG will seek to encourage the participation of private, community or other non-government organizations in rural development works. The government will formulate appropriate rules and regulations and create a conductive environment in order to increase the participation of private, community and non-government organizations. The present government has adopted the policy of gradually increasing the annual budget expenditure for the upliftment of deprived families and the rural areas upto 70 percent of the total development budget. The local organizations will require funds to develop basic infra-structure for rural development. The government will carry out a feasibility study of setting up a separate \"Local Development Fund\" to provide financial assistance to Village and District Development Committees. The Eighth Plan proposes to implement the following programmes for improving the socio -economic conditions of the rural population: a. Training Programmes As the training programmes conducted in the past were not compatible with local needs, the lower-level administrative and technical staff engaged in rural development could not develop their professional competence. Furthermore, the training programmes were not integrated with production programmes and hence their effectiveness remained very low. So the training programmes to be conducted during the Eighth Plan will be focussed to meeting local needs. While conducting training programmes at the local level, attention will be given to upgrade the competence of the elected officials and local staffs. In addition to this, programmes that enhance the management, resource mobilization and resource use capability of local bodies will be encouraged. Similarly, training programmes oriented forwards developing skills and employment opportunities for women for making then self dependent, as well as programmes on child care, nutrition and family planning for raising family standard will be implemented. All training programmes will be conducted on the basis of the specific needs of local organizations and users groups skill oriented training. will be made more professional and integrated with loan facilities. A separate Act will be formulated during the Eighth Plan to provide autonomous status to the training centers, The Women\\'s Training Centers, Local Development Training Centers and Municipal Development Training Centers presently operating in the country will be covered by this Act. A Training Council to be set up under this Act will be made more professional, functional and self sustaining. Under the Training Council a Center for production of necessary training materials will be established to fulfil the need of training centers. Besides these, a research study will be carried out to assist local bodies in the preparation and implementation of local development programmes and identify training needs. The research will be kept under the Training Council and integrated with it. During the Eighth Plan period, the Training Council will organize training and seminars in various field such as planning and management, User\\' Committee organization, skill development and communication to 10499 persons including elected office bearers of Village and District Development Committees government organizations. While conducting these programmes, special attention will be given to motivating the local women to improve their social, economic and educational status. in this regard a total of 9459 women will be provided training in skill  \\xa0 development, community development, nutrition, training for women teachers, environment and cleanliness, adult literacy, pre-service training for women employees, and development of local technologies. Besides these population education programme will also be carried out to increase awareness of local people towards population growth. Regarding the production of Training materials, the Eighth Plan will production increase the production collection and distribution of training materials for assisting local development programmes. The target in this regard is to publish 18 books, 7 training manuals, 20 magazines on development themes, 30 news bulletins on local development issues 1 progress report of the Eighth Plan; to organize 5 meetings of experts; conduct 5 research studies; prepare 12 sets of charts and posters; send 15 persons for technical training; establis h I offset press, etc. b. Remote Area Development Programme The remote area is in a very backward state as compared to other areas due primarily to the country\\'s difficult geographical position and unbalanced regional policy of the past. The 18 districts that were designated as remote areas in 1968 are still in a poor state of development. The primary reason for the low achievement in relation to investment appears to be the implementation of programmes on an ad-hoc basis, rather than on the basis of local needs and potentials by the Remote Area Development Combined and other local organizations in the past. Thus keeping in view the low growth rate, virtual lack of infrastructure and lack of education and other facilities in remote areas it is essential to initiate special efforts to alleviate poverty and backwardness of these areas. For this, the first and foremast requirement is to classify remote areas on a scientific basis. A separate study will be carried out for this purpose. The Remote Area Development Programme in the Eighth Plan will be directed towards poverty alleviation and construction of\\' social as well as community infra structure. The programme for developing local and community infrastructure will include construction of mule tracks, drinking water projects, temples, charitable houses, schools and hostels. For these programs development grant to be allocated to remote areas will be increased, and the spending capacity of the local bodies will be increased. This will be achieved by providing training and technical assistance to the local bodies. Furthermore, the organizational structure of the Remote Area Development committee will be improved and its pro grammes will be aligned with the District Development Committees for the more objective and effective results. The integrated Rural Development programme will also be extended to remote areas. The programme for the development of monasteries will also be co-ordinated with the Remote Area Development Programme. Under the Remote Area Development Programme during the Eighth Plan 200 persons will be taken to study tours, 50 overseers will the provided re-orientation training 300 persons will be trained in carpentry and masonry scholarships will be granted for graduate-study of engineering to 5 persons 18 persons will be given an opportunity to participate in workshop seminars on accountancy and 180 Users Committees will be trained. In addition to drinking water will be provided to 30 thousand people, irrigation facilities to 500 hectares of land and roads, bridges and other physical facilities will be provided to 30 \\'thousand people. Furthermore, afforestation will be carried out in 200 hectares of land, and 15 experimental mechanical water mills 2 solar- power stations, 20 small and cottage industries 5 daily and wool processing programmes and 5 fruit preservation projects will be initiated. Regarding monastery development in the Eighth Plan 35 monasteries will be renovated, roof of 14 monasteries will be repaired, 5 seminars\\' will be organized for Buddhist lamas, a National Institute for Monastery will be constructed and a book on local language will be published. c. \\tWomen\\'s Development Programme The Women\\'s Development Programme is carried out to improve the socio-economic conditions of the poor and under-privileged women. The local branches of the Women\\'s Development programme working under the Ministry of Local Development have been carrying out the work of organizing women of low-income groups and increasing public awareness through field workers. Under this programme, provision is made to make available collateral-free loans to-women organized in groups for undertaking income generating activities in agriculture, livestock cottage industries, and services business, etc through the commercial-banks. In the fiscal year .1991/92 this programme was implemented in 49 districts benefiting - 20,052 families. At the community level the programme has benefited some 269 thousand people. This programme, however, has not proved to be effective because of  high operating cost and its orientation towards to community development rather than income-generating activities. The program also failed to establish women organizations that are self-sustaining. The Eighth Plan will, therefore, seek to solve these problems in women development in order to make the programmes more effective. The Eighth Plan aims to increase the earning capacity of women and implement programmes that can raise the status of women, both socially and economically. The non-government organizations will also be encouraged to participate in such women development programmes. During the Eighth Plan period, the Women Development Program will be expanded to 64 districts. The main objective of this extension programme will be to activism the women who live below the poverty-line in various development works and make them self-dependent by improving their economic condition through the implementation of employment generating activities. The existing deficiency of rural women in skills and other attributes will also be eliminated through training These programmes to be implemented at the central as well as district levels will be supported by various international agencies such as, UNICEF, Asian Development Bank, UNFPA, IFAD, FINNIDA, USAID, CIDA, GTZ, EEC, FAO etc. The Women \\'s Development Programme at the central level !includes programme monitoring, research and feasibility studies, market surveys, development of and extension appropriate technology, seminars, workshops, publication and publicity while the district-level programmes includes income generating, community development and training programmes. During the Eighth Plan period, a total of 197.8 million rupees will be disbursed as loan for income generating activities to 7,912 women credit groups, from which about 39,560 families are expected to benefit. Regarding community development the Eighth Plan aims to implementing 526 small-scale drinking water projects which will benefit 5260 families, and implementing 564 irrigation projects that are expected to benefit 940 families. Similarly, literacy programme will be conducted in 3,119 centers and these ate expected to benefit 93,570 rural women. It is also planned to establish 582 child care centers benefiting about 17,460 children. Furthermore, environment conservation programmes will be implemented in 1011 areas, appropriate technology development programmes in 958 areas, and construction and renovation programme in 357 areas. During the same period, attempts will also be made to organize 3,436 community development groups and encourage small women groups to form inter-groups and organizations respectively. similarly 13907 people will be given training in health, nutrition, population education and family welfare. For smooth operation of these programmes, close coordination will be maintained among the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry and Environment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Industry as well as various private and non-government organizations. The programmes related to Women\\'s Development will be prepared, implemented and supervised according to felt needs of local women. One Women Development officer and a few women assistants will be deputed in each district and programmes and will be smoothly managed and monitored. These programmes, however, will not be operated as parallel programmes but will be co-ordinated and supported by various government and non-government organizations and agencies involved in such activities and the programmes will be implemented by involving local bodies right from the planning stage. d. \\tIntegrated Rural Development Projects A review assessment of various rural development projects carried out by the National Planning Commission revealed a lack of effective co-ordination among concerned departments, lack of growth in production base owing to failure to give priority to the development of basic infrastructure, inability to benefit the under-privileged groups of people, and lack of sustainability of programmes. In order to correct thes e drawbacks, the Integrated Rural Development Programmes to be implemented in the Eighth Plan will give priority to those projects which are concerned with production increase, poverty alleviation, and also those which increase public participation, make the users\\' community self reliant and enhance local capability to undertake development projects. Such programmes will be focussed towards the benefit of backward areas and poor community. The selection of projects will be done according to the priority set by the District Development committee. The project will also seek to increase the participation of non-government organizations in poverty alleviation, and infra -structure related projects as well as institutional development. These .include the MECHI Hill Development Project, Rasuwa-Nuwakot Integrated Rural Development Project, Dhading Integrated Rural Development Project, Gorkha Development Project, Lamjung Integrated Rural Development Project, Gulmi-Arghakhanchi Rural Development Project, Palpa District Integrated Development Project, Rapti Project, Karnali-Bheri Integrated Rural Development project, Karnali Community Development Project and Seti Integrated Rural Development Project. e. \\tUrban Area Basic services The Municipalities have been providing basic services like health facilities to poor women and children, and carrying out education, sanitation and skill-oriented prog rammes in the urban areas for the past few years with assistance from UNICEF. Presently, these programmes are being implemented in the least developed wards of Biratnagar, Lalitpur, Nepalgunj, Pokhara and Dhangadhi municipalities. During the Eighth Plan period this programme will be extended in additional 10 municipalities of Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, Janakpur, Hatauda Birgunj, Bharatpur, Rajbiraj, Dharan, Tansen and Birendranagar in two phases. Basic services such as primary health services, sewerage, drinking water and sanitation facilities, community building, training in sewing and knitting, etc. will be provided in urban areas with active participation of the people. The tribal communities living in different areas of the country, particularly in remote areas are being by passed by the development process. None of the previous rural development programmes have reached to these people. For achieving growth with justice it is necessary to improve the socio-economic condition of these deprived people in order to increase their participation in the development process. Special programmes will, therefore, be carried out to improve the living standard of the weaker sections of our society during the Eighth Plan perio d. Necessary efforts will also be made to develop the language, culture, art and literature of these people. These will help to remove the imbalances emanating from the existing distribution of income and also contribute to national integration. Among the nomadic tribes in Nepal, the Praja tribe is on the verge of extinction, and hence it is necessary to save  this tribe. During the Eighth Plan period various programmes relating to agriculture, education, drinking water, road construction, health posts, etc., will be implemented to raise the economic, social and cultural conditions of this tribe. These programmes will be implemented in various districts through the District Development Committees. g. \\tDevelopment Grant 1. Provision for Local Development Fund A feasibility study will be carried out during the Eighth Plan period for setting up a separate Local Development Fund to provide financial and material grants to local bodies. This fund to be set up as an autonomous body will receive grants allocated by government for local development as well as grants from donor agencies. The Fund will provide grants or loans to project on the basis of their nature. As the provision grants by HMG depends on government income, the allocation of fund is low when income is low and it is likely that certain construction projects may not get completed, Past experience has shown that if the grants given to local organizations are not tied to their resource mobilization capability, they may not be motivated to mobilize local resources. Therefore, in order to avoid such possible negative effects and encourage local resource mobilization grants to be provided from the Fund will. be linked to the local resource mobilization by local bodies. Besides, the resources of the Fund will be made available to local bodies for the development of backward region and poverty pockets. 2. Block Grant During the Eighth Plan period a block grant of Rs 2,113.7 million will be provided to local bodies to carry out local development works by mobilizing local resources and manpower. This grant amount will be provided to local bodies through the Ministry of Local Development on the basis of the following criteria; 1. 2. Geographical remoteness. 3. Land tax and other revenue to be received by the district. 4. Investment in programmes such as Women Development, Remote Area Development and Integrated Rural Development in the district through the Ministry of Local Development. 5. Internal resources and income source of the district. The Eighth Plan has a target of providing 70 thousand bundles of corrugated sheets to be used as roofing materials by schools in the 75 districts of the Kingdom under the grant-in-kind programme. Additional grants will be given to some municipalities to purchase fire-fighting 4 equipments. Implementation Arrangements The local development programmes to be implemented under the Eighth Plan will not be directed from the Center but will be undertaken, from the planning stage onwards, with the support of district line agencies and in co-ordination with the programmes of District Development Committees. In order to strengthen existing Training Centers, a separated Act will be enforced for their autonomy. In addition, local organizations such as users, Committees. Women Self Reliance organizations, private sector enterprises and co-operatives will be encouraged to carry out programmes related to local development by strengthening and developing these organizations. The local people will be mobilized to the maximum extent possible for effective implementation of local development programmes. The Ministry of Local Development will conduct various training programmes at the local level to promote the institutional capability of local bodies and will also play a co-ordinating role by providing necessary technical and financial support to the local bodies for effective implementation of local development programmes. Details of-Expenditure A sum of Rs 4010 million will be spent through The Ministry of Local Development for the implementation of local development programmes during the Eighth Plan period. The programme -wise budget allocation is as follows: Supplies Introduction It is essential to maintain regular supply and easy availability of essential consumer goods of daily use and construction materials. It is also necessary to maintain stable prices of such goods. An efficient supply system is of utmost importance in distributing goods from surplus areas to deficit areas and to import in time commodities that are partiality produced in the country or totally imported and make them available at the village-level. As the supply of all essential. goods may not be possible through government sector, private sector\\'s role is also equally important. Progress during the Seventh Plan The Seventh Plan had a target of increasing the sale and distribution of foodgrains from 53,500 metric tons, in the first year of the plan to 62,100 metric tons by the end of plan period. Apart from this, the Nepal Food Corporation maintained stock of foodgrains ranging between 15,000 to 25,000 metric tons for regular supply. The Seventh Plan had a target of increasing the sale and distribution of foodgrains from 53,500 metric tons, in the first year of the plan to 62,100 metric tons by the end of plan period. The actual amount sold was 37,000 metric tons in the first year and 33,000 metric tons in the last year. The Nepal Oil Corporation imported 11.33 thousand kilolitres of petroleum products and sold 11.13 thousand kilolitres. The Seventh Plan had a target to construct storage tanks with a total capacity of 8,630 k.l. but the storage capacity of tanks constructed in Pokhara, Biratnagar, Dipayal, and Surkhet did not exceed 3,600 k.l. During the plan period, the National Trading Limited had a plan to import 2,600 million rupees worth of construction materials and other essential consumer goods, and purchase of 1,000 million rupees worth, of domestically produced industrial goods. The Timber Corporation sold a total of 2 million 866 \\'thousand cubic feet of log wood, 3 million 618 thousand cubic feet of timber, and 5 million 947 thousand quintals of fire wood during the plan period. The Nepal Coal Ltd had a total sale of 286 thousand metric tons of coal. Progress during the Fiscal Years 1990/91 and 1991/92 During the fiscal year 1990/91 the Nepal Food Corporation had a target to buy 26,806 metric tons of food grains, but the actual quantity bought amounted to only 15,630 tons. The sales target of foodgrains was 40,000 metric tons, but only 33,755 metric tons of foodgrains were sold. During the first 8 months of the fiscal year 1991/92, 18,000 metric tons of foodgrains were bought and 24,600 metric tons were sold. Since the fiscal year 1990/91 the Nepal Food Corporation has been selling foodgrains at reduced prices by opening fair price shops on co-operative basis. Presently thereare 128 such shops. During the fiscal year 1990/91 the Nepal oil corporation imported 2,28,842 kilolitres of petroleum products out of the target of 2,67,645 kilolitres. During the first 8 monthls of the fiscal year 1991/92, 2, 19, 000 thousand kilolitres of petroleum products were imported and 2,23,000 kilolitres were sold. During the fiscal year 1990/91 the National Trading Ltd imported 253.1 million rupees worth of construction materials. During the fiscal year 1990/91 the Timber Corporation sold 5,35,000 cubic feet of log wood, 4,44,000 cubic feet of timber and 6,59,000 quintel of firewood.

The Nepal Coal Ltd sold 38,000 metric tons of Coal in the fiscal year 1990/91 and 56,000 metric tons during the first 8 months of the fiscal year 1991/92. Existing Problems The government has not been able to supply required quanitity of foodgrains to the remote hilly areas which suffer from food scarcity. It has not been possible also to provide adequate amount of transportation subsidy for transporting foodgrains. Likewise, Nepal Food Corporation lacks the resources to store foodgrains on a large scale. The lack of capital, inhabited the construction work of fuel storage as per schedule. Background of the Eighth Plan The democratic government has a prime responsibility of ensuring adequate and regular supplies of essential consumer goods and development materials. Supply Management and Distribution of such goods can be made more effective if plans are formulated and implemented on the basis of surveys, studies, research and analysis. 1. To ensure for regular supply of essential commodities. 2. To stabilize the prices of essential commodities. 3. To maintaing a minimum reserve of essential commodities and to provide foodgrain security. 4. To encourage the private sector in supply management with the government acting as a motivator. 5. To make arrangements for the control of black marketing and hoarding of essential commodities. Policies 1. Research, studies surveys and analysis will be carried out to make supply management more effective. 2. A free market policy will be adopted in the supply management of essential commodities in accessible areas. 3. An open market policy will be adopted in case of commodities which are supplied by the private sector. 4. The private sector will be allowed to import foodgrains, and export them during times of surplus. 5. Minimum support prices will be fixed in time to make supply management of essential commodities more effective and to provide adequate support to farmers. 6. The prices of goods to be distributed by government agencies will be fixed in keeping with open market policy. 7. Study, survey and research will be made on the price trends of essential commodities in order to protect consumer interest. 8. Foodgrains provided to rural areas through transport subsidies will be gradually reduced with an increase in production resulting from the agricultural development programme. 9. Co-operative societies will be encouraged in the sales and distribution of essential commodities. 10. In order to control abnormal increase in the prices of essential commodities from time to time, and stabilize market prices, a policy will be adopted to maintain reserve of foodgrains and other essential consumer goods. 11. The role of corporations concerned with trade and supplies will be clearly defined. 12. Government subsidies to various corporations will be gradually reduced. 13. The supply and distribution system will be regularly monitored at the district, zonal and central levels so as to eliminate the problems of black marketing and artificial shortage. 15. Timely amendments will be made in the laws relating to black market-and essential commodities. 16. A programme will be prepared for introducing supply management information system. 2. Demand Projection National demand and supply projections of essential commodities will be prepared every year along with the details of domestic production and surplus. 3. Purchase and Sales Programme a. A policy will be adopted to encourage and strengthen the participation of the private sector in the purchase and sales of essential commodities. b. The policy of government procurement and sales ofcommodities will be adopted to intervene in the market and supply commodities to remote areas. c. \\tIf the demand projections show that the locally produced goods is not sufficient to fulfil the demand, the private as well as the government sector will be allowed to import such goods from foreign countries. d. \\tA policy of encouraging local purchase will be adopted by fixing market prices keeping in view the transport subsidy in food deficit areas. e. \\tIf the demand projections show surplus foodgrains, export of this surplus will be permitted on the basis of levy system. 4. Distribution System a. The private sector will be encouraged to manage supply and distribution in accordance with the open market policy. b. \\tconducive environment will be created for the private sector to supply goods to the Himalayan and remote hill areas, and the role played by government in this respect will be gradually reduced every year. d. \\tIn order to make the supply management more effective, -the dealers of the corporation will be mobilized to function as retailers and will be asked to maintain regular supply of commodities. e. \\tThe supply of foodgrains will be made more etfective by opening cooperative fair price shops in the urban market centres f. \\tEasy availability of essential commodities will be maintained through consumer co-operatings in rural areas. g. \\tThe policy of stabilizing prices will be continued to reduce uncontrolled rise in price in the accessible areas. 5. Reserve Programme Reserve of essential commodities will be maintained to protect and provide relief to the consumers by stabilizing prices and to safeguard against natural disasters. The following considerations will be taken into account while maintaining reserves: a. Arrangements will be made to reserve foodgrains and other essential commodities in different places so that these are readily available for supply and distribution. b. In order to stabilize market HMG will procure foodqrains and other essential commodities with arrangements to reserve these in godowns belonging to Corporations or private mills. c. \\tThe private sector will also be encouraged to maintain reserves in accessible areas as well as remote areas to that the programme of maintaining reserves and stabilizing market prices can be implemented more effectively. 6.

Details of Expenditure During the Eigth Plan period Rs 700 million is estimated to be spent for projects to be carried out through the Ministry of Supplies. Miscellaneous (Planning and Administrative Reforms) Introduction The success of any development effort depends on the preparation of development plans, their effective implementation and assessment of progress made. The preparation of a development plan according to its objectives requires the collection of reliable data, their analysis and publication. If the plan and its implementation are faulty, it cannot produce the desired result. It is necessary to emphasize on regular review and assessment to achieve effectiveness in implementation. The development and use of computer technology have increased dramatically in the world market. The Ministries, Departments and Corporations of HMG as well as the private sector are also making increasing use of computers . In this context, it is necessary to adopt a practical policy on how best we can benefit from the use of this technology. There is also a lack of a feasible policy for institutional development in the area of science and technology. Administration is an important aspect in the implementation of national plans, and a development administration is a key factor in the development of the country. Expected results can be obtained if the development administration of the country is made efficient, capable and frugal. For this purpose, it is essential to reform our laws, regulations and policies from time to time and upgrade the efficiency of officials to improve the system of administration. Progress during the Seventh Plan Planning Various programmes implemented during the Seventh Plan under the heading \\'Planning\\' are as follows: One of the objectives was to study the impact of the implementation of the Sixth Plan on the general life of the people. The c oncerned institutions also conducted required studies and research for the effective implementation of the national level policies. In order to develop some important sectors that affect the national economy such as agriculture, forestry ,irrigation, power, industry, education, health, transport and drinking water, it was aimed to formulate a long term plan or make projections for 15-20 years on the basis of an up -to-date evaluation of the existing plans. Progress according to the target was recorded in the development of library, achievement evaluation, and review and monitoring of projects. The mid -term evaluation of the implementation of the Seventh Plan was also completed and the report prepared. The Plan has succeeded in upgrading the performance of government officials through training and workshop seminars. The Government, however, has not been able to study the nature and number of. new jobs created through investments under the Sixth Plan in various sectors including agriculture, and the extent of educated unemployment in the country. Similarly, no studies have been carried out on the problems relating to agriculture and their possible solutions, nor on the ways and means and their problems and solutions of increasing revenue from agriculture. The delay in the preparation and publication of the Eight Plan was caused by the directive of the interim government to that effect, following the democratic movement. Statistics A high-level National Statistical Council was established during the period to facilitate the work of collecting, processing and analyzing data and avoid duplication in these tasks. As a part of the effort for the development of statistics, the reorganisation of the Central Bureau of Statistics is in the last phase. A manufacturing census was conducted in 1987 and an analytical report has been published. Similarly, several other activities have been carried out including a survey of Cottage and Small Scale Industries, annual survey of manufacturing industries and introduction of the Nepal Standard Industrial Classification, colle ction and publication of data on public services such -as education, health, drinking water, power and natural disasters and other surveys related to social and economic life of the country. All information on statistics are published regularly, and progres s has been made in library administration. In addition to these, an index of manufacturing products was prepared, gross national product was estimated on the basis of statistics on national income -expenditures, and a multi-purpose production survey was imp lemented. A preparatory work for the survey of agriculture was completed in 1991, and a report on Population Statistics was prepared and published on  the basis of the National Population Census 1981 /82. Medium-level manpower has been produced through computer training programmes in 16 subject areas. The National Computer Centre together with certain government and non-government organizations has developed and utilised some useful software packages. Attempts were made for the computer manpower to be self-reliant in repair and maintenance of computer hardware. Information on computer technology are publicized through various media and a software package on Devanagari has been developed and brought into use. Further, a Devanagari Word Processing Software package has also come into use. The National Council for Science and Technology has succeeded in carrying out various tasks during the Seventh Plan period. These included policy-based studies on Science and Technology publication of books and reports, studies on manpower development and organization of various seminars and workshops. The Ministry of General Administration conducted reviews of various development programmes and the regular activities of Ministries. The administrative reforms carried out during the Seventh Plan show the following progress. The organisation and management study of ten organizations was completed and recommendations were made for implementation. Manageme nt consultancy services have been provided to organizations on a regular basis. As regards group division and work description, the postal services and the Nepal statistical service have been formed under the Administrative service. A total of 126 gazetted officers and 5,305 non-gazetted employees were given administrative training under the Civil Servants Training and Research Programme. Fifteen issues of the periodical entitled \"Administration\" were published, and a policy on the training of civil servants was prepared and implemented in all government training centres. Besides, assessments were made on their effectiveness, and seminars relevant to office heads were conducted. Laws and regulations on Civil Service are being reformed as found necessary. A directive on the security of government. offices was prepared and implemented. Progress during the Fiscal Years 1990/91 and 1991/92 Planning During the two fiscal years of the interim period, the National Planning Commission Secretariat conducted various development works. These included monitoring and evaluation programme, natural and cultural resource conservation, preparation and publication of the Eighth Plan, a study on the impact of the Seventh Plan oil tire general life of the people decentralization programme, library development, preparation of annual programme, strengthening of the National Planning Commission Secretariat, and programmes for the National Council of Science and Technology. Among these programmes, the one on monitoring and evaluation was carried out during the fiscal year 1990/91 according to set target, but as the concept of priority projects was withdrawn during the fiscal year 1991/92, this plan was net implemented. The programme on natural and cultural resource conservation made progress as planned during the fiscal year 1990/91, cut failed to make satisfactory progress during 1991/92 duo to various reasons, the chief among which was the failure to establish the proposed National Land Resources and Environment Centre for formulating policies, conducting research and coordinating all conservation activities in the country. Approach to the Eighth Plan has been published and the main text of the Plan is being prepared for publication. The Report on the impact of the Seventh Plan on the general life of the people has been prepared. Village-level studies have been made in 6 districts with a view to bringing about necessary reform in the decentralization programme, and various training programmes have been conducted for gazetted and non-gazetted employees, Similarly, under the library development programme a wide range of books and periodicals have been obtained through contacts and publication-exchange agreements with international agencies and government libraries. The Secretariat has also published a periodical entitled \"Development\". Apart from this annual programme, reports have been published and distributed. HMC has provided logistic support as per agreement to the National Planning Commission Secretariat strengthening project. A policy based study was conducted on the programmes related to the National Council for Science and Technology and a report to this effect has been published. During the fiscal years in question, various programmes were undertaken. These included publication of statistics and information, library development, development of Social statistics, economic indexes, national agricultural census, national population census and national accounts development projects, Among these under the project of Data Publication and Library Development, the, library of Central Bureau of Statistics was equipped and various pubiications relating to data were brought out. Regarding economic indicators programme, indices of agricultural and industrial production were prepared; the results of the manufacturing census were published by editing and refining the data subsequent to the completion of the survey; and the preparatory work for the 1993-94 manufacturing census was completed. similarly, the regional census of agriculture 1991/92 and the preparatory work for National Agriculture Census were completed. The National Population Census was also conducted within the time specified, and its preliminary results have been published. During 1990/91 and 1991/92 periods, the statistics on national accounts were collected, the gross national product was estimated and the results of the Multi-purpose Production Survey were published. These included System development and software support, system transfer and implementation, training, maintenance and engineering support, development in research and consultation. The progress being made in these programmes is satisfactory. The newly elected government in giving the highest priority to administrative reforms, formed a high-level Administration Reform commission in 1991/92 under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. This Commission made exhaustive studies and has presented its suggestions and recommendations on administrative reforms. within this period, various activities were also carried out on a regular basis. These included studies on administrative organization and management, seminars of the heads of offices, the transfer and promotion of gazetted officers, preparation of a legal provisions for departmental action, scholarships and foreign training. Existing Problems The review of progress made in various development programmes implemented by the National Planning Commission Secretariat has revealed problems related to the lack of adequate funding or under-utilization of funds. These development programmes have also suffered from failure to apportion the amount of funds as demanded. On the other hand, the amount of funds invested cannot be spent as required due to financial regulations. Apart from these problems, the lack of skilled manpower in the National Planning commission Secretariat is another handicap. The National Statistics Council established to develop and coordinate all statistical activities has been less effective due to the lack of appropriate legal provisions to meet now demands and needs. The various programmes implemented by the Central Bureau of Statistics are being handicapped by various problems including the dependency an foreign aid and the failure to enter into agreements in time with donor agencies. The gross domestic product of the country is still being estimated on the basis of incomplete and unreliable data. The available economic statistics are not upto date and this hinders improvement in the computation of the national income. Further, the problem is compounded by a lack of permanently employed skilled and, professional manpower in statistics. The failure to achieve desired success in the implementation of programmes conducted by the National Computer Centre is due mainly to the unfavourable conditions prevailed in the country at that time. The programmes implemented by the National council for Science and Technology usually face many problems due to delays in the sanction of the budget, preparation of reports by research workers and evaluation by experts. The measures that have been taken to bring administrative reforms have so far proved ineffective. The present slackness in administration has, therefore, failed to provide essential services to the general public. More specifically, the existing problems include the failure to simplify the administrative system, the failure to assess the performance of officials effectively through a system of rewards and punishments, failure to promote or upgrade professional competence on the basis of long-term needs, the lack of delegation of authority and responsibility to lower level employees and the inability to identify delegated authority due to vague and non-transparent provisions. Background of the Eighth Plan An up-to-date knowledge and information of different sectors of the country is a prerequisite for the formulation and successful implementation of the present plan. The formulation of policies and preparation of programmes will depend essentially on the supporting activities such as research, studies, evaluation and other inputs. Besides the development of such infrastructures, it will be necessary to screen projects and to reform the organisational structure of the planning agency. It is essential to obtain up-to-date and reliable statistics while formulating the development plans and programmes in consonance with the policies and objectives of the national plan. The collection, analysis and publication of reliable statistics are also necessary for the preparation and successful implementation. of individual plans. The Eighth Plan has included a programme for the collection and analysis of statistical data in order to complete the programmes that were initiated during the Seventh Plan. It is also necessary to formulate a clear policy on the applications of computer technology in our development efforts. The Eighth Plan has for this purpose proposed various programmes to remove problems such as scarcity of funds for science and technology, indefinite plan of work, and the lack of institutional management in areas of science and technology. Objectives Planning The role of planning in the economy has undergone a constructive change subsequent to the formation of the elected government. In place of the previous practice of strict economic control, there is now an increased reliance on the initiative, efforts, entrepreneurship and creativity of the private and non-government sectors in their participation in productive development activities. The implementation of development works, therefore, being no longer the sole responsibility of the government, requires active involvement of the private and non-government sectors. The planning process will be further refined and made more scientific keeping in view the development needs of the country The aim will be to create favourable conditions for the implementation of the plan, and to undertake periodic monitoring and evaluation for its effective implementation, statistics It is essential that a plan and its requisite policies-are prepared on the basis of reliable and up to date statistics. The process of collection, verification and analysis of such data will be made as practical and scientific as poss ible. It will also be necessary to Maintain co-ordination between the collector of data and the users, and organize information exchange programme more effective in order to support policy-making decisions. computer The objective of the Plan will be to develop. the use of computer technology in areas where this is necessary by maintaining close co-ordination between the government and non-government sectors. science and Technology The main objectives in this area will be to increase investment in the science and technology sector, to increase physical facilities and create suitable conditions, to conduct training programmes, studies and research, and to increase the uses of science and technology through institutional development. Administrative Reform ain objectives will be to strengthen the development administration for efficient implementation of development programmes by making it more prestigious and reliable and to make the administration more production and development oriented by enhancing the capability and effectiveness of administrative units rather than their number. Similarly, it is also aimed at enhancing the management capabilities and augmenting the quality of services by mobilising the private sector and NGOs for better services and facilities to the general public. The revenue administration training will be conducted in order to increase the capability and skill of employees working in revenue and accounts services. Policies Planning Studies and research on various areas will be carried out as inputs to the preparation of the periodic plans. The results of such research will continue to be used. The methodology used to prepare the plan will be made more practical and scientific. A policy will be adopted to reform present practices related to classification of capital, current and other expenditures. The staff engaged in preparing the plan will be trained so that they are able to use new methods and techniques. Statistics The policies will involve making the National Council of Statistics more effective, establishing a scientific and efficient central data bank, developing statistical service (as a part of the Nepal Civil Service) bringing about reforms in the organizational structure of the Central Bureau of Statistics, and developing the important: agencies involved in economic and social statistics as focal points for maintaining coordination among various bodies/agencies involved in statistical activities. Several measures will be undertaken to develop science and technology in the country. These will include increase in physical facilities, manpower development, import and use of suitable technology from other countries, and development of traditional technology and skills. Computer A National Computer Training Centre will be established to develop computer-skilled manpower, along with development of software and research activities on various aspects of computer application. As computer technology is a national need, its services will be expanded gradually on a regional\\' basis so as to increase public awareness of its important potentials. A National Information Documentation and Network Services will be developed to collect important data and information from various computer centres operating in the country and to make them available on exchange basis. Administrative Reform Policies will be formulated to implement the recommendations proposed by the Administrative Reform commission for a more effective re-organization of the administrative system in the country. (The Policies on Administrative Reforms are included in the principal National Policies) By conducting studies and research on revenue and financial administration, the revenue service will be strengthened. Programmes Planning Mid-Term Evaluation of the Eight Plan: The mid-term review and evaluation of the Eighth Plan will be carried out to assess the progress made and to be familiar with the nature of the problems encountered in the implementation of the Plan. Studies for the Preparation of National-Level Policies and their Effective Implementation Long -term Plan A long-term public investment Plan will be prepared on the basis of studies and research related to financial And developmental aspects. Library The library and documentation facilities at the National Planning Commission Secretariat will be developed for planning and research purposes. Strengthening National Planning Commission Secretariat Certain necessary measures will be taken to strengthen of the Planning Commission Secretariat so that it can contribute more fully to the preparation, evaluation and. analysis of development plans. Project Screening An appropriate projects screening mechanism has not yet been developed at the National Planning Commission Secretariat and in line ministries owing to the lack of basic information such as the rate of return, sources of financing and so forth. The Secretariat and the Ministries for this reason need to be reorganized and developed so that they are able to select and implement projects that can have direct impact on economic growth. Such project selection methodology will be gradually designed and persued on an institutional basis. Monitoring and Evaluation Necessary programmes will be implemented to strengthen monitoring and evaluation system, which will ensure successful implementation of development programmes. Poverty Alleviation The various programmes to be undertaken for this purpose are outlined in the related section of the Plan. Long -term Plan During this Plan period, a long-term plan on agriculture, energy, transport and other areas will be prepared and implemented. The details of this plan are included under the relevant section. Natural and Cultural Resource Conservation A national policy will be prepared and various programmes will be conducted to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the country through effective control measures against environmental pollution. Council for science and Technology These measures will include increased investments on projects that create employment opportunities and higher productivity, research and technology transfer, increase in physical facilities, information dissemination, provision of support systems and division of work as required, a greater sense of responsibility, establishment of agencies for co-ordination purposes and selection of programmes most suited to local and national needs. Statistics The Central Bureau of Statistics will implement the following programmes: Publication of Statistics and Library Development The information on statistics will be disseminated to both domestic and foreign organizations as required, and relevant reforms will be introduced in library management. Improvement in Social Statistics Analytical studies on statistics relating to various social aspects will be published, and district-level social profiles as well as the indicators on the social status of women will be prepared. Economic Indices Various economic indices relating to production and market prices will be published. Improvement in National Accounts The estimates of national accounts and the methods of working out these estimates will be improved. These estimates are obviously necessary for the preparation and evaluation of the National Plan. National Population Census 1991/92, Population Analysis and Demographic Sample Survey The statistics obtained from the Population Census will be analyzed; major changes in the population will. be studied, population projections will be made, and surveys will be conducted to update vital statistics such as the birth and death rates and migration. Reliable statistics required for the formulation of agricultural plans will be made available, and the results of the agricultural census will be published. Industrial Census/Survey of Small and Large Industries The results of such analysis will be published. Plans have also been made to prepare industrial indicators and to carry out surveys of small and large industrial plants following the main census. Development of Household Survey The plan proposes to conduct regular household surveys to obtain up to date data on the social and economic field, as well as to improve on survey techniques. Vital Registration Programme The plan envisages a number of programmes to collect vital statistics on births and deaths, and migration pattern on a regular basis. Computer The following programmes on computer technology will be implemented during the Eighth Plan period. Teaching and Training A Computer Training Centre will be established to prepare skill manpower in computer technology. Such training will now be extended to the private sector. Necessary arrangements will be made during this plan period for the private sector and educational institutions to implement training programmes. Software Development and Research A suitable software programme will be developed with contributions from various computer agencies, and\\' marketing facilities will be set up for this purpose. Among the various aspects of computer technology, the use of the Devnagari script for processing of information will be given priority for special research. further, necessary action will be taken to export suitable software packages. Computer Repair and Maintenance The self-reliance achieved in certain aspects of computer repair work will be maintained, and programmes will also be implemented to prepare more specialists for the continuity of this achievement. The organisations under the private sector will also be encouraged to contribute tothe development of this service. Extension of computer Services The Eighth Plan proposes to establish branch offices of the National Computer Centre at suitable places or where necessary in order to provide essential computer services and to extend the use of computer technology in the country. Development of National Information Bank and Network System A National Information Centre will be established to develop proper systems of storage, processing and regular dissemination of important information on computer technology. In this task, the National Computer Centre will function as the chief coordinating agency with its computer system acting as the centre of the national computer network. Administrative Reform Administrative Reform and Reform in civil service This reform programme will be implemented during the Eighth Plan to impart greater sense of responsibility in civil servants and to enhance efficiency in the administrative system. Under this programme, the job descriptions of existing civil service posts will be prepared, professional groups will be set up on the basis of work specialisation, and standards of work and responsibility will be established according to the status and nature of duties. In addition to these, the recommendations made by the Administrative Reform Commission will be implemented with periodic assessments/and follow up. Organisation and Management Measures will be taken to reform the organisations and the management systems of HMG according to the recommendations of the Administrative Reform Commission. The Eighth Plan proposes to study the structure of 14 organisations, to conduct 23 monitoring studies, and to prepare office manuals and programmes. Training, Research, coordination and Evaluation This programme is being introduced to make administrative training more effective, During the Eighth Plan, it is proposed to train 25 groups of district-level officers, conduct seminars on training coordination for 5 groups, and publish 15 issues of the journal \"Administration\". Strengthening of the Public service Commission Appropriate reforms will be made in t he methods of assessing the candidates for selection and recruitment. Curriculum Reform The curriculum will be improved and updated according to changing needs. The documentation section of its library will also be strengthened. Building Construction: The Public Service commission proposes to construct its own examination building as it has been facing numerous problems in having to conduct examinations in various school buildings on rent. The Commission will also take necessary steps to have a Central Regional Directorate building constructed. Arrangements will be made to acquire land and other physical resources for constructing the Directorate building. Administrative Training It is self-evident that the employees will be able to increase their work effic iency if they can be given in-service and refresher trainings as required. The Administrative staff College was established to provide necessary training for the higher and mid-level employees. During the Eighth Plan, the Administrative Staff College will implement various training programmes including\\' in-service training; training for gazetted first and second class officers, employees of government as well as non-government organisations. The Plan aims to organize 10 seminars for HMG officials and the heads of government departments. Besides, studies an the current administrative problems, certain services such as consultancy and trainer-trainee interaction will be offered. The-Revenue Administrative Training Centre will conduct various training programmes to improve the revenue service by mobilising its internal resources, to upgrade the efficiency of staff and to provide other necessary services. Implementation Arrangements The secretariat of the National Planning Commission will prepare and implement various programmes outlined in the Eighth Plan. These will include programmes related to planning, statistics, and computers as specified in the procedures of implementation. The programmes relating to statistics will be implemented by the Central Bureau of Statistics and the various units under it. The programme related to vital statistics will be carried out by the Home Ministry. All programmes on Science and Technology will be implemented by the National Council for Science and Technology which functions as a government organization under the National Planning Commission Secretariat.\\' The administrative reform programmes will be implemented by the Ministry of General Administration, the Public service commission and the Administrative Staff College. The programmes on revenue administration training will be carried out by the Centre for Revenue Administrative Training. Details of Expenditure It is estimated that a total of 133 million rupees will be spent in 1991/92 at the constant price. This amount will be used to implement various programmes specified under the project heads of the Eighth Plan. Out of this total amount, the sum of 56 million rupees is expected to be spent for the National Planning Commission Secretariat and the National Council for Science and Technology. This amount includes the budgets assigned to various area off ices at the regional and district levels operating under the National Planning Commission Secretariat. The expenditures required by the National Computer Centre will be met from its own revenue sources. The government will also take necessary steps to obtain support and assistance from foreign countries to help develop programmes and projects on computer technology. During this Plan period, it is estimated that a sum of 170 million rupees will be spent in fulfilling the aims and policies of administrative reforms. Thus the total amount to be spent under the heading \"The Plan and Administrative Reform\" during the Eighth Plan is expected to be 303 million rupees. Poverty Alleviation Background Poverty is a widespread phenomenon in Nepal. Though there is a lack of dependable data as regards the magnitude of poverty it is estimated that 9 million people (i.e. 49 percent of Nepal\\'s total population) live in absolute poverty. The country\\'s development is obviously impossible without the participation of such a huge section of population in the development process. Hence, special efforts will, therefore, be made during the Eighth Plan for poverty alleviation. Since the attempts made in the past for poverty alleviation were faulty in principle and weak in implementation, the general public could not benefit from them as expected. Instead, different materials and services provided by the government as grants or at subsidized rates were utilized either by the relatively well off ones or by the comparatively better-off group among the poor. The situation was such that the households living in the condition of abject poverty and backwardness, both socially and economically, did not either know at all about the services delivered by the government or they were not able to utilize such services even if they knew about them. For this reason, the poverty alleviation programmes to be undertaken in the Eighth Plan will be so formulated and implemented that the relatively well-to-do families may not grab these benefits and the real poor ones will benefit directly or indirectly. Since, the poverty alleviation task is of multi-.. in nature; it is essential for the programmes of all sectors to make a concerted effort to alleviate poverty. Hence, all the sectoral programmes will be directed towards poverty alleviation. Identification of the Actual Poor It is essential to identify the backward rural areas and the people living below absolute poverty line before formulating and implementing poverty alleviation programme. The criteria used in the past under the rural development programme to identify poor families were faculty therefore, the target group could not benefit effectively from the programme. The poverty level of people living in rural community can be easily ascertained on the basis of their housing, food, cloths and other living conditions. However, such a procedure would be rather ad- hoc and inadequate to specify the level of poverty on the basis of specific parameters which can reflect the real situation explicitly. In the past, different organizations employed different parameters to assess the level of poverty; so there was no uniformity in them and no accurate assessment could b e made available regarding the extent of poverty in the country. In the Eighth Plan, simple parameters will be devised to ascertain the real situation of poverty. Accordingly, the poor people living in the areas where the poverty alleviation programme is to be introduced will be identified and effective programs will be launched for social and economic upliftment of. such families. Decision will also be made regarding the region where such \\'programmes ought to reach. Policy Arrangements The following polic ies will be adopted to alleviate poverty during the Eighth Plan period: (a) To develop a simple procedure for identification of undeveloped areas and poor families and use it uniformly across all sectoral programmes. (b) \\tTo carry out self-targeted and targeted programmes for poor people. (c) \\tTo increase the access of the poor to the means of production. (d) \\tTo make arrangements for awarding contracts of technically simple construction works to groups of poor people. (e) \\tTo make legal provisions for elimination of social evils and to create public awareness in this regard. (f) \\tTo make effective legal provisions against exploitation of the poor and the helpless. (g) \\tTo initiate dialogue for negotiations with foreign governments/ agencies for the employment of unskilled and skilled Nepalese manpower seeking employment in foreign countries. (h) \\tTo arrange for creating employment opportunities in non-agricultural sector through food security programmes. (i) \\tTo take environmental balance into consideration while designing a programme. (j) \\tTo make institutional arrangements for extending necessary support to the task of poverty alleviation. The people in general, irrespective of the region they live in, can be benefitted from the investment made by the government in building various social and physical infrastructures and in developing agriculture, industry and other economic activities. However, such investment may not reach those nooks and corners of the Kingdom  which are inhabited by the poorest of the poor. For the purpose, it is deemed necessary to envisage a special programme for the socio - economic upliftment of those places and the people living there. Programmes such as production credit, training, provision of employment, children\\'s education, nutrition for mothers and babies, etc. will be introduced for poor families on individual or collective basis. Emphasis will be laid on the construction of assets community like *road, bridge, school, drinking water, irrigation and health post which would, directly or indirectly, benefit poor households. The following programmes and targets have been set for the improving the socioeconomic condition of the poor during the Eighth Plan: To Develop Physical Infrastructure Since poverty is generally rampant in backward areas, arrangements will be made for the construction of physical infrastructures such as roads, irrigation projects etc. for the development of such areas. Such labour-intensive construction works will generate employments for the poor. Programmes such as food -for-work will be utilized for the creation of these physical infrastructures. Arrangements of labour-certificate will also be made under this programme. Infrastructure development projects will be executed by the government or non-government agencies and arrangements will be made to deposit some portion of the remuneration earned by the participating labourers into a nearby financial institutions in order to enable the workers to draw loans from financial institutions against the labour certificate issued to them. To Increase the Poor\\'s Access to Means of Production The community and natural resources and assets available in the various parts of Nepal but not yet adequately harnessed will be studied and evaluated and made available to the poor households free or on lease. These resources include forest land with thin crown cover, waste land, pond, lake and river bank etc. The surplus land above the land ceiling will also be acquired and used for settling the poor in a systematic manner on the basis of social justice. C. Education and Training Education and training will be another important component of poverty alleviation programme. Other sub-components under this will be functional nonformal education, adult literacy programmes, social awareness development training, skill development training for the successful implementation of income generating activities, entrepreneurship development training, excursion tours of successful programme sites etc. D. Social communication Programme These programmes will be launched in order to make the poor people fully aware of different activities such as those of social, economic or legal nature and appropriate technology that have direct impact on them and raise their level of awareness. Under this programme, expansion of programme -wise assistance to communication facilities, formation of mobile communications teams, establishment of community centres, use of video- technology and different other means and technologies of communications will be brought into practice. E. Population Programmes Since it has been observed that the number of poor grows at a faster rate under a higher rate of population growth, it has been imperative to adopt effective measures to check population growth for the success of poverty alleviation programmes. Activities under the population programme for the poor mainly include awareness raising programme about fa mily planning use of contraceptives, control of birth rate, maternal-child health care, child care and nutrition \\'and increased supply of means of birth control: As it is imperative to have a healthy body in order to qualify for employment, efforts for food and improved health  of the poor will be taken as a precondition. Employment for the poor will be generated through intensive farming programmes, increased construction activities, establishment of refinery and industrial districts and promotion of employment\\'opportunities in other nonagriculture based activities. Employment opportunities for the poor and landless families will increase to a marked extent due to their access to land and other public and community assets. The simplification of process of obtaining credit for employment generating activities and provision of increased  fund for the credit programme may also bring about an increase in the income generating employment opportunities. G. Food Security Programme Food security measures will be adopted in order to involve the poor in relatively more market-oriented activities for increasing their income. These measures include expansion of food-for-work programme, effort for increased integration of hill and Terai markets, arrangements- for regional food storage, developing awareness for change in food habits, diversification in food consumption, control of foodgrain leakage and improvement in the system of foodgrain procurement and distribution. H. Development of Technology for the Poor Efforts will be made for developing, testing and extending divisible and appropriate medium-scale technology suited to the capacity of the poor, in particular, with the allocation of larger research grants. I. Labour Export Labour may be exported in two ways: first through the increase in the export of the labour-based products and secondly by direct export of workers thus benefiting them from the higher rate of wages existing in the countries importing labour. Whe reas the above gender discriminatory programmes may benefit the women in different ways, other special programmes for women will also be launched. Activities under these programmes will include enactment of effective law against dowry system, development of time -saving technologies for women-run activities, health and nutrition programmes for lactatory mothers, income generating activities for the upliftment of women in the family as well as the society. Laws against the exploitation of child labour will be enacted and enforced. It has been found that various tribes and aborigines of the hills and the Terai have not been effectively benefitted from the general development programmes, Hence, appropriate programmes will be developed and implemented for their social and economic upliftment. The poverty alleviation programmes currently in operation will continue as they are and higher efficiency will be developed in their working style. Under this organizational structure of programmes such as Production Credit for Rural Women, Remote Area Development Programme, Integrated Rural Development projects etc., will be improved and focused towards the poor. The targets, of these programmes have already been mentioned in the chapter on Local Development. Organizational functions such as organizing the poor in groups so far being carried out by these programmes will gradually be handed over to the NGOs and individuals assigned to National Development Service (NDS) programme, thus confining the task of these programmes only to service delivery and enhancing their efficiency. Institutional Arrangement To carry out the aforesaid programmes for poverty alleviation effectively, necessary institutions would be set up. A. Establishment of a Trust-Fund in connection with the development of necessary institutional arrangements for the socio-economic upliftment of the backward areas and the identified poor, a feasibility study for the e stablishment of an autonomous Trust Fund will be carried out during the Eighth Plan and the Fund will be established accordingly. The Fund from within its resources will make available grants and loans for the institutional development of NGOs, private sector, consumers\\'/users\\' committees and farmers\\' groups and for the package programmes of poverty alleviation to be executed by these organizations/agencies. Likewise, the Fund will provide grants and loans for initiating poverty alleviation programmes in place and areas where sectoral programmes to be implemented by different government agencies are felt inadequate. These groups may organize themselves as intergroup units, small-scale cooperatives, full scale cooperatives or further higher level institutions. These groups or organizations may include such units as specialized contractors\\'s groups, production units, marketing groups, commodity organizations, industrial units, services units and any other groups engaged in different activities. An atmosphere conducive to their becoming self-sufficient will be created and necessary unity among these groups will be ensured. Training has an important place in this regard. In course of the programme implementation, the Trust will develop necessary planning-related indices to be included in its future policies and programmes. Similarly, provisions will also be.made for the formulation, execution, monitoring and evaluation of the programme. Accordingly, model village programines will be conducted at 10 places one in the hills and one in the Terai of each development region. Under this programme, the poor farmers will be organized into groups and arrangements will be made so as to ensure retail services in the locality through the intergroup units; and service agencies in such areas will only deliver wholesale services. It is estimated that it will, at least, take 5 years to develop such institutional arrangements in a region. B. Poverty Alleviation Credit Programmes While making the Small Farmers\\' Development Programme being implemented by the Agricultural Development Bank for the socioeconomic upliftment of small farmers more effective by developing maximum number of self-motivated organizations thus improving the lot of member poor families through these organizations, the programme (SFDP) will also be extended to new poverty stricken backward areas. In the same vein, similar approach will be adopted with regard to \"Production Credit for Rural Womens\" programme. C. Revival of the National Development Service Programme A feasibility study will be undertaken to align the National Development Service Programme with poverty alleviation by bringing about necessary changes in the programme conducted by Tribhuvan University earlier. D. Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation of procedural details and implementation of programmes designed for poverty alleviation will be done at 3 different levels. At the first level, it will be carried out in accordance with the procedure fixed by the National Planning Commission for the monitoring and evaluation of sectoral programmes. Out by the Monitoring Unit within the Trust Fund in proper coordination with the district development boards. This unit will monitor and evaluate all programmes aided by the Fund. At the third level there will be a Poverty Monitoring Unit established under the Rural Development and Decentralization Division of the National Planning Commission. The functions of this unit will be as follows: 1. To conduct basic/baseline surveys and determine the magnitude and level of poverty. 2. To develop necessary planning indices relating to poverty alleviation policies and programmes. 3. To determine the number of those crossing the poverty line through various poverty alleviation programmes. 4. To identify disadvantaqed/backward areas having a high number of poor population. Targets and Programmes The magnitude of poverty will remain confined to conjecture unless the poor are really identified. Recently, the number of the poor in Nepal is estimated to be approximately 9 million, one-third of them being ultra-poor. Even more alarming is the future outlook of poverty which is to grow further in magnitude. According to recent estimation, the annual increase in the number of poor households has been 2.2 percent. If the present trend continues, the number of the poor will reach 10.2 million, i.e. an increase of 1.2 million by the end of Eighth Plan. Considerable efforts should be made even to maintain the absolute number of poor at the present level. Therefore, the, poverty alleviation programme will have to make a quantum leap as regards the process and quality of target activities. The Eighth Plan has a goal of promoting approximately 1.4 million poor people to non-poor status through different programmes. In the event of this goal being achieved, there will be about 8.7 million (42 percent of the population) poor people in the country after the conclusion of the plan period. Manpower and Employment As more than 49 percent of the nation\\'s total population live below poverty line, the Eighth Plan has envisaged the alleviation of poverty as one of its major objectives. To achieve this end, it is essential to create opportunities of productive employment for the existing as well as rapidly increasing labour force. owing to high population growth rate as well as women\\'s labour force participation, the number of employment seekers has gone up from 4,850,000 to 8,500,000 during 1971-91. In the last two decades labour force has increased by 183,000 annually i.e. 2.9 percent per annum. However,- the growth rate of labour force has not coincided with the rate of economic growth. As a result, productive employment has not increased, giving rise to the issue of unemployment and underemployment, which has further aggravated the problem of poverty. Despite the priority given to the generation of employment in the previous plans, there had been no substantial progress in this field owing to the lack of political commitment and weak implementation. The previous plans had surveyed the need for manpower of various levels, but, owing to slackness in implementation, even high-level manpower like engineers, medical doctors and agriculturists were unemployed. According to a recent estimation, labour force will go up at the rate of 200,000 individuals annually, i.e. 2.3 percent during the next plan period. The greatest challenge is to create opportunities of productive employment for them. About 650,000 persons are estimated now to have remained unemployed. To create employment opportunities for them is another big issue. The existin g underemployment poses another difficult problem. According to the present estimation, about 1,000,000 additional jobs will be required to resolve this problem of underemployment. All these issues cannot be sorted out within a single plan period. it will be the main objective of the manpower and employment policy to reduce the pressure of growing unemployment and underemployment gradually and to involve the maximum manpower in the task of national development in a dynamic and productive manner. Approximately 1,449,000 productive jobs are estimated through public and private investments in various sectors during the plan period. The estimated number of jobs to be created in the various sectors will be as follows: The following policies will be adopted to create the above estimated opportunities of employment and enable the nation\\'s manpower to exploit them. Policies 1. Despite the low growth rate of estimated employment in agricultural sector, it is the only sector which can provide the largest number of jobs in the country; it has the highest potential for absorbing labour force along with productivity within a short period. The agricultural sector will, therefore, receive priority as regards to the allocation of investment. in order to create additional employment opportunities in this sector, investment will be directed towards crop intensification and diversification in particular, as there is little probability of expanding the area of arable land. Accordingly, agricultural programmes like irrigation, development of cash crops and agroforestry will be emphasized. 2. As unemployment and underemployment are mostly found in rural areas, programmes for developing rural infrastructures will be accorded priority. In selecting these programmes, priority will be given to the programmers conducive to agriculture and other programmes. These rural programmes will be carried out by local agencies as far as possible. Emphasis will be laid on adopting labour-oriented technology in implementing them. 3. To resolve the problems related to rural unemployment and underemployment, small and cottage industries appropriate to rural areas will be provided with incentives. To achieve it, programmes will be carried out with additional provisions of technical assistance, skill training, loan facility, etc. In addition, necessary reforms will be brought in the legal provisions pertaining to industry, commerce, customs and taxation. 4. \\tit is not feasible to sort out employment-related issues in long-term perspective without promoting non- agricultural sectors. For this purpose, necessary policies and laws relating to industry, commerce, economy, customs and taxation will be formulated and implemented. The private sector will assume major role in non-agricultural fields. Foreign investments will also be encouraged for the promotion of this sector. 5. The traditional and non-traditional industries and professions which can rapidly add up to productive jobs will be identified and necessary provisions will be made to promote them. 6. The existing industries and enterprises are confined to a few places in the country. In this connection necessary policies and rules will be formulated and incentives will be provided for dispersing industries and enterprises in various parts of the country, especially in undeveloped areas. 7. Necessary policy measures will be adopted to encourage the use of labour-intensive technologies in agricultural as well as non-agricultural sector. At the same time, emphasis will be laid on the development and extension of technologies contributing to the growth in labour-productivity. 8. As most of the existing manpower in the country is illiterate and unskilled, opportunities for basic education and technical and vocational training will be extended to rural areas in particular. 9. The existing manpower will be made skilful and efficient to compete in labour market. Necessary steps will be taken to offer tax incentives and other facilities to industrialists to organise productivity enhancing training for their workers. 12. Provisions will be made on institutionalized basis to assist labourer for acquisition of jobs. 13. If the present growth rate of labour force continues, it will be difficult to\\' solve the problem of unemployment. 14. Necessary arrangements will be made for the agencies concerned to collect and update information and statistical details related to manpower and employment. 15. Attention will be given to women\\'s maximum participation while formulating various policies and imparting training regarding employment and as far as possible, targets will be explicitly stated. The statistical details pertaining to employment and manpower will be collected in such a way as to specify the status of male and female separately Environment and Resource Conservation Nepal is well-known all over the World because of the beauty of its natural and cultural heritages. However, for  the last few decades, the natural resources have been facing depletion owing to poverty, slow economic development, higher population growth, unplanned urbanization and establishment of industrial sectors, lack of renovation and preservation of the sites of cultural value, lack of environmental education and lack of attention towards the environmental aspects in the formulation and implementation of development plans. The major problems concerning nature and its flora and fauna have res ulted from rapid forest depletion, land erosion, loss of bio-diversity, desertification and the deterioration of the soil fertility and so on. In addition, the soil quality has been affected at places due to irrational use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in soil and water-related environmental problems. In Nepal, forests are under tremendous pressure, they are the only source for 90 percent of fuel, timber, fodder and other forest products required for domestic purposes. This pressure is further aggravated by the slow economic growth and increasing population, and with deforestation there has been a decline in productivity in agricultural sector, while the ecology of hills has been badly affected by soil erosion and land slide. Land surface has also been adversely affected by, unscientific cultivation of marginal and steep slope land on hills. A similar situation prevails in Chure region, where an extensive deterioration of the vegetation and living creatures is noticed. Similarly the Soil erosion and flood resulting from the gradual degeneration of this vulnerable region has reduced the fertility of land in the Terai. The soil erosion in Chure hills, which occupies 13 percent of the country\\'s total area, has posed itself as a major nationalproblem. Land erosion, landslide, decline in the soil fertility of land and lack of suitable employment opportunities have acted as the main contributing factors to migration from high hills to the Terai plain land and urban areas. This situation has aggra vated pressure on the limited resources available in urban and plain regions and is disturbing the equilibrium between the hills and the Terai. Several of the erstwhile towns and trade centres in the hills are being deserted now. Some Past Efforts As an effort to prevent environmental degradation, the environment and land use policy was incorporated for the first time as a national policy in the Sixth Plan (1980-85). Subsequently, environment was recognized in the Seventh Plan (1985-1990) as an important aspect to be integrated into every development project. However, the related programmes could not be implemented effectively. Political commitment as well as adequate number of efficient agencies to direct, supervise, coordinate and provide consultancy services to these programmes were seriously lacking then. Besides, legal provisions were inadequate and ineffective to protect and promote national natural resources. Towards the end of the Seventh Plan and later, some important measures have been undertaken for the environmental protection and management. In 1988, the National Conservation Strategy was formulated and approved to preserve national heritages and endowments and in 1990 the Council for the conservation of Natural & Cultural Resources was set up. Similarly, environmental preservation and management was accommodated in the Constitution of Nepal, 1991, and Nepal became a signatory to the treaty on biological diversity and climatic change at the Earth Summit held in 1992. Policies 1. Environmental management and economic progress are related and complementary processes; hence, the  need to develop a system will take environment into account while designing and implementing development projects at central and local levels. 3. Natural and cultural assets, traditional preservation technology and skill, etc. will be documented; the materials available in this sector will be scientifically analyzed and upgraded and bio-diversity, traditional know-how and skill will be broadened in their horizon. 4. Extensive legal provisions will be made and implemented for environmental management. While sustainability will be taken as the top most objectiv e in formulating such legal provisions, emphasis will be laid on adopting an integrated approach in all environmental policies. 5. In addition to the existing condition of natural environment, air, water, noise and land-related pollution will be investigated and analyzed to prepare indicators, scales and action-oriented guidelines for their utilization. Hence, the protection and promotion of environmental resources is not feasible without people\\'s participation. That is why emphasis will be laid on disseminating awareness and information among the masses through various communication media, political agencies, elites of society and government and non-government organizations. To widen environmental education, it will be incorporated formally in primary-and secondary-level curricula and informally for other people. 7. Necessary financial and procedural incentives will be provided for promoting voluntary initiative from the industrial sector in achieving continuity in environmental protection and utilization. 8. A high-level Environment Protection Council will be set up to formulate policies, give directives and establish inter-ministry coordination & monitoring related to environmental management. 10. Causes for air, water, noise and land-related pollution will be investigated through on-the-spot observation and mitigating management plans will be formulated to control pollution. In this regard, emphasis will be laid on adopting technology required for minimizing solid waste and reutilizing it. 11. Special care will be taken for proper use and protection of natural and cultural resources in course of carrying out feasibility study for promoting tourism or setting up tourist spots. Environmental management plan will be developed and implemented to gradually check ecological loss at the existing tourist spots. Like, the policies related to environment and resource preservation, its programmes are multi-purpose and multi-f aceted. As such, these policies will be implemented through various agencies concerned with the environment and resource protection. In this connection, the following will be the main programmes to be carried out. by the various agencies related to environment. Institutional Development Programmes 1. As the management of environment is multi-faceted and requires the involvement of various organizations, it is essential to establish a balanced approach and coordination among human beings; natural resources, environment and development which will be brought into operation through the establishment of a hig h-level environment council under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The secretariat of the council will be located at the National Planning Commission. 2. Under the guidelines of this council, the planning sections of various environment-related agencies will be strengthened so as to incorporate environmental aspect within their plans for formulating various sectoral plans and their implementation. 3. The manpower existing in the environmental sector will be mobilized and, if necessary, provisions will be made for additional manpower. 5. Scientific laboratories relating to environment as well as data bank will be set up to install various data bases required in environmental management. Some of the laboratories set up under different agencies will be upgraded to the national level. Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) Programme Prior to carrying out large-scale development projects (esp. road, hydro- electricity, industry, irrigation, housing, drinking water, sewerage, etc. ), priority will be given to the obligatory assessment of the environmental impact at the time of conducting their feasibility studies. On the basis of these studies adequate fund will be allocated in the project budget to minimise adverse effects on the environment. Provisions will also be made to monitor whether such environmental impact assessment has been made or not. Programme for Identifying and Preserving Sensitive Areas Surveys and studies will be undertaken to diagnose the areas sensitive to desertification. Environment-related projects will be designed and carried out for preserving and promoting the areas important from the viewpoint of  environment through the, identification of ecologically fragile areas and desert land and these projects will be implemented stagewise. Conservation Programmes for Natural and Cultural Resources 1. Activities like collection, genetic analysis and documentation of important vegetation, endemic species and many other natural living resources will be carried out on a regular basis . A report of genetic resources with future uses will be maintained and provisions will be made for in -site conservation and ex-site conservation in different parks, reserves and laboratories. 2. Appropriate national and sectoral guidelines will be formulated for devising environmental plans of natural and cultural spots. 3. Environmental plans will be envisaged for different natural and cultural sites to enhance the development of tourism and gradually implemented for their conservation and promotion. 4. Necessary research activities will be undertaken with a view to preserving and promoting useful traditional technology, skill and efficiency existing in different regions. Pollution Control Programme 1. Studies on assessment of existing situation will be undertaken in terms of water, air, noise and soil pollution in order to control them, for which basic indices will be prepared. Action programmes involving appropriate technology will also be carried out to control pollution from various sources. 2. Appropriate management work plans will be made and implemented to control pollution. For the purpose, appropriate manpower will be developed and trained. 1. Environmental knowledge and practical awareness will be promoted on the basis of people\\'s participation by carrying out publicity activities. Various conferences, seminars etc. will be organized for improving efficiency in promoting this awareness. In addition, a report will be published on the existing situation of national resources. 2. Programmes like the incorporation of environmental education in school curricula, dissemination of environmental awareness through communication media and other programmes with NGOs\\' participation, e.g. environmental education, environmental health, afforestation land use, water conservation, etc.will be introduced environmental education programmes. Land Utilisation Agriculture, forest, pasture and other sectors occupy 26.5%, 42.4%, 18.8% and 19.1% of land respectively in the  recent land utilization situation in Nepal (See Appendix 1). owing to its geographical diversity ranging in altitude from less than 100 meters in the Terai to 8848 meter comprising plains, valleys, rivers and river basins, glens, alpine. upward, high hills and the Himalayas, there exist different climates and different types of farming within the same district and the same region. In this perspective of land-use, it appears that the concept of dividing Nepal into the Terai Hills and Mountains on the basis of the assumptions made in the earlier plan, needs to be changed. There is indeed a great variation in the amount of rainfall even within the dif f erent parts of the Terai and also of the Hills. Likewise, temperature has more than 80% relation with attitude; however, there exists no such relation between rainfall and altitude; that is to say, rainfall varies at the same altitude (See Appendix 2) . Bhawar, hills, high hills and Himalayan region. There appear diverse pockets in terns of rainfall, temperature, altitude and rivers in terms of irrigation. feasibility, which is the reality for Nepal\\'s land utilization plan. When we consider land\\'s altitude, steepness, temperature, forest and arable land as a whole, we find that 27.5% of the country\\'s total land is more than 3,000 meters above the sea-level and has limited population density and agricultural production owing to its cold climate. Similarly, 13.6 percent of land is estimated to have steepness of one or a lesser degree and 58.8% land with 20 degree steepness. Owing to extreme steep surface and fragile hill land, there exist problems in Nepal like landslide and erosion resulting in the decline of productivity on the one hand, while, on the other, the process of deforestation causing adverse impact on environment is continuing in the Terai whose forested la nd is considered suitable for cultivation from the viewpoint of productivity. In this context, the government\\'s past efforts have not been successful to a great extent. Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems essential to formulate an extensive master plan for developing pasture, arable land, forest, settlements, urban areas, parks, and forest. This study needs to be conducted from social, political, economical, ecological and other practical perspectives. Such a plan will ensure increase in productivity of limited resources and accelerate the pace of achievement and development of physical resources in rural community and eventually make substantial contribution to qualitative improvement in the living standard of most of the rural people. There is unanimity about land utilization that it would be more beneficial to give priority to the maximum utilization  of agro-ecological potentials in the formulation of the plans in the near future, as there continues the predominance of agriculture in the ru ral development of Nepal. Taking this into perspective, the Eighth Plan has formulated policies in consonance with the sustainable utilization of land available in the country. Policies 1. In utilizing land resources, priority will be given to more economically profitable activities based on employment growth, as one of the alternatives of various land uses. 2. In accordance with agro -ecological zone to make maximum utilization of regionwise resources on the basis of the diversity of land size and climate, production of food grains, fruit farming and livestock farming will be gradually expanded. In this activity the formulation of district-level plan will have a significant role; hence, a system will be developed to formulate district development plan by preparing districtwise maps compatible with the agro ecological zone. 3. Regional and national agricultural research will be gradually aligned with land-ecology. In order to promote as well as enforce this process, regional and national level monitoring task forces will be created by drawing land-ecology subject specialists from government as well as non-governmental agencies. 4. Non-agricultural land use will be discouraged within the command area of an irrigation project. S. \\tMeasures will be undertaken to preserve the forest in Chure range and Bhawar region for controlling ecological conservation, and controlling land slide and river cuttings. Incentives will be provided for promoting community or lease hold forests in marginal land of all zones. 6. Priority will be given to the extension of the industry, urbanization and commercial farmings within the impact zone of roads. 9. Initiatives will be undertaken towards designing a master plan in a long-term perspective to utilise the available land in the country from the view point of appropriate economic use by establishing coordination among forest, agriculture, environment and development. 10. Details about land utilization and other relevant information will be made available at both district and central levels and coordinated under the National Planning Commission. In this connection, steps will be taken to update the land-use statistics of LRMP by conducting a model survey, set up computerized Geographical Information System (GIS) and strengthen Nepal Remote Sensing Centre. In order to make landutilization and ecological information effective, an appropriate institutionalized system will be evolved under the National Planning Commission by means of integrating scattered units into a single whole. 11. Necessary amendments will be made in the existing laws relating to land utilization and additional laws and rules will be framed and implemented. Regional Development Background Planned development efforts in Nepal were initiated since last three decades or more. Despite some material achievements observed in some socio-economic sectors due to planned development efforts in the last few decades, it will not be an exaggeration to say that there is still a long way to sort out the inconsistencies and problems existing between resourceful and resourceless regions, rich and poor segments of the population and urban and rural communities, in a meaningful way. Failure to mobilise the ever growing population outside of agriculture has compelled large number of people to extend farming even in marginal land for making a living. Population growth has had adverse impact on land utilization in both hill and Terai regions. Growing population, insignificant development of non-agricultural occupations and population pressure on agriculture have given rise to national problems like migration, land erosion, deforestation and unorganized settlement on the one hand, while, on the other, the Investment policy, while selecting bases for national income growth, has been confined to the development of only a few places with resources and development potential. As a result, the benefits of development have not been proportionately to different regions and the country has to face problems of sorts. There is a great diversity in the status of different geographical and development regions of the country. The Terai occupies 23.11% of the country\\'s total area, whereas the hills and the mountains cover 35.21% and 41.68% of the area respectively. In terms of land distribution by development regions, the largest area (22.8%) is covered by the Mid -Western Region, while the smallest area (13.3%) belongs to the Far Western Region. The Western Eastern and the Central Region account for 20\\' , 19. 3% and 18.6% of the total area respectively. The Far Western Region, geographically smallest as it is, also has lesser areas of all physiographic regions namely Tarai. hills and mountain. In terms of population distribution, the Terai has the largest population, followed by the hills and then the mountains. Among all regions, the Central Region is the most populated area. According to the preliminary 1991 Census report, the country\\'s population is 18.462 million of which 6.174 million (33.44%) is in the Central Region. The Eastern Region, the western Region, the Mid-Western Region and the Far Western Region have 4.448 million (24.11%) , 3.752 million (20.32%), 2.406 million (13.03%) and 1.681 million (9.11%) people respectively. Terai has the highest population density with lowest density in the the Mountain. In terms of the development regions, the Central and the Far Western Regions have the highest and lowest population density, respectively. Of the total population (18.462 million), 1.682 million people (9.11%) live -in urban areas. In the census year 1991, there were 33 municipalities in the country. Of them, 9 municipalities were n the Eastern Region, 13 were in the Central Region, 5 were in the Western Region and 3 each were in the Mid-Western and Far Western Region. In terms of sub-regions, the hills in the Central Region and the Terai in the Eastern Region have the highest number of municipalities and the mountains of none o f the development regions have any Municipality. Thus, from the perspective of urbanization, the Central Region is the most highly urbanized of all the regions. As regards land utilization, 18% of Nepal\\'s total area has had no utility at all. Such land includes barren land, land-slide affected areas, pasture land, snow-covered land, etc. The land utilized for different purposes constit utes 82% of the total land, of which the area utilised by human beings is 20%, and the remaining 62% of the area is left to the natural own use. Agricultural land has been regarded as the land utilized by human beings. Similarly, urban areas, plantation areas are also treated in the same category. As Nepal lags behind in urbanization, the area used for this purpose is estimated to be only 0.08% of the total area of the country. The percentages of the total land used for agriculture are 9.3% in the mountains, 43. Development regionwise, the Mid-Western Region has the largest forest area (27.39%) followed by 21.04% in the Central Region, 18.09% in the Eastern Region, 16.83% in the Western Region and 16.65% in the Far Western Region. It is estimated that about 986,898 ha of land (6.5% of the country\\'s total area) is still available for agricultural purposes. Looking at the numerical distribution of industries in Nepa7l, the central Region stands at the lead position with 47.4% of the total industries. Mid and the Far-Western Region each has less than 7% of the industries. As regards physical infrastructure, the Central Region again occupies a lead position in the regionwise distribution of road transport facilities. The length of roads in the Mid and Far-Western Regions is considerably less. 43, the Eastern Region has 11 followed by 8 in the Central Region, 7 in the western Region, 9 in the Mid-Western Region and 8 in the Far Western Region. As regards regionwise distribution of the postal service under the communication sector, there are 598 post offices in the Eastern Region, 614 in the Central Region, 486 in the Western Region, 305 in the Mid -Western Region and 258 in the Far Western Region. There are variations as well in the regionwise aistribution of social service facilities like education, health and drinking water. It has been found that these services are mostly confined within the Central Region. There are 22 hospitals in the Eastern Region, 40 in the Central Region, 23 in the Western Region,.and 13 each in the Mid and Far-Western Regions with 725, 2663, 724, 303 and 353 beds respectively. Similarly, the distribution of health posts from the Eastern Region to the Far Western Region is 171, 216, 178, 151 and 100, respectively. moreover, Ayurvedic hospitals have also been extending health services. Their regionwise distribution in the same order is 26, 42, 39, 19 and 19, respectively. As of 1990, there were 5,272 schools, 876,002 students and 22,180 teachers in the Eastern Region; 6,926 schools, 10,78,732 students and 29,301 teachers in the Central Region; 5,960 schools 880,824 students and 23,847 teachers in the Western Region; 3,458 schools, 406,436 students and 11,391 teachers in the Mid-Western Region; and 2,143 schools, 255,313 students and 7,314 teachers in the Far Western Region. These figures reveal that the Central Region outnumbers other regions in terms of number of schools, students and teachers. One of the major factors responsible for such a regional imbalance is the inefficiency in implementing several programmes in consonance with the regional development policies envisaged in the previous plans. Ir addition, the atmosphere conducive to implement necessary programmes and projects was also lacking in the past. Objectives The objectives for the regional development policy in the Eighth Plan are as follows: 1. To increase regional and national production and reduce regional imbalance by Mobilizing resources and assets scattered in different parts of the country; and 2. To integrate rural development process with the national mainstream by improving the prevailing economic condition of I less developed rural and backward areas. Policies To achieve these objectives the regional development policies envisaged in the Eighth Plan are as given below: 1. To gradually reduce the imbalance existing in interregional and sub regional socio-economic development; to develop the existing resources and means scattered in various regions and sub-regions on tire basis of regional analysis; and thereby strengthen the base of regional development. 2. To gear tire regional investment towards minimizing the existing regional and sub-regional Socio-economic imbalance. 3. To establish closest link and coordination among the existing or evolving infrastructure and facilities and production-oriented economic activities, in the context of formulating development programmes for different regions, sub-regions and districts. 4. To develop functional interrelationships between different regions and sub-regions and rural. and urban areas. Attention will be given to the development of hierarchical settlement system. 5. To prepare site-profiles of regional development in order to establish appropriate functional interrelations and coordination among national, regional, sub-regional and district levels. 6. To take necessary steps to institutionalise the planning which determines national priority on the basis of regional and sub-regional plans. 7. To implement regional development plans in line with the decentralization policy. 8. To lay special emphasis on the development of internal, transport system appropriate from transit perspective. 9. To pay attention to environmental conservation and promotion while utilizing arid mobilizing regional resources and endowments. 10. To precisely determine the means and resources required to devise the model of regional investment for accelerated pace of development. 11. To take necessary steps towards developing urban areas on a planned basis at suitable locations along the Mahendra Highway and North-South link roads in the context of growing pressure of urbanization and to promote small town developments in other suitable areas with a view to support the rural development. 12. To determine appropriate distance to service centres or units in terms of command area with a view to provide necessary services to the rural communities and to carry out welfare programmes for underdeveloped areas and backward communities. 13. To formulate and implement land utilization plan by adopting appropriate strategy to be adopted at regional, sub-regional and local levels so as to make proper utilization of local means and resources including the maintenance of ecological balance. 14. To enable the offices of development-related ministries and departments in each development region to formulate, implement, coordinate, monitor and evaluate development programmes. 15. To seek greater and direct involvement of NGOs and national-level organizations and agencies with due consideration to their scope of activities in regional development programmes. Decentralisation Definition Decentralisation implies a transfer of authority and responsibility from a higher level of a hierarchy to a lower level. Since the majority of the Nepalese people live in the rural areas, it is but natural for development works to begin from the village level. The policy of decentralisation, therefore, implies the process for transferring authority and responsibility to local bodies in the formulation, implementation and effective management of development plans and projects with active participation of the local people. The process of decentralisation in this way attempts to integrate development plans with a more supportive role of the local organisations. Major Theoretical Aspects of Decentralisation The effective involvement of the people in development activities will depend largely on clear and simple guidelines, together with the institutional development of local organizations based on motivation, honesty and democratic principles. The general public need to be mobilized for participation in local development so that they can learn and benefit from their own experiences. Towards this end, His Majesty\\'s Government will allow the people to implement programmes at their own pace. The system of decentralisation that the parliamentary government seeks to establish is based on such close collaboration between the people and the government. Background The people\\'s movement in 1989 that led to political change has. created a favourable climate for implementing the process of decentralisation in the country. The decentralisation system will provided opportunities to the people to make their own decisions on the development needs of their areas. The new Constitution of Nepal has also made legal provisions for basic human rights and democratic freedom. The laws enacted in 1991 have specified the organisation and functions of local bodies at the district, municipal and village levels. However, the relationship between the central government and the local bodies is yet to be defined clearly. They are, (1) a highly centralized system of administration where higher level decisions are imposed on the lower level, and (2) the lack of commitment and responsibility in carrying out official tasks. These weaknesses have been reinforced by political leaders, carried out by bureaucrats and encouraged by foreign aid. Political decentralization has now been recognized as the best means for removing these two obstacles to development. In implementing this process of decentralisation, public participation will be sought in various development programmes including poverty alleviation, reduction in environmental degradation and rapid economic development. Decentralization in this way goes beyond the concept of formal government and involves the freeing of local non-governmental and private organisations as well. The role of government therefore is not to dictate but to support the development activities of non governmental organizations. Objectives of the Decentralization Policy 1. All citizens of the country should have the freedom to organise themselves to implement development plans. The main aim of the decentralization policy is to support and assist all development activities implemented by the people at their own initiative and to seek to develop the local government as well as non -government organizations involved in such activities. 2. The economically viable development activities need to be directly beneficial to the people, and as for as possible such activities should be initiated by the people themselves. The second aim of this policy is, therefore, to make the government officials and decision makers (local politicians) responsible for providing essential support and services to public organizations engaged in development activities directly accountable and answerable to the people themselves. 3. All transactions relating to development must be carried out with honesty and fairness. The third aim of the policy is thus, to increase public trust in local political institutions by maintaining accuracy and transparency of their financial records relating to development works. Basic Policy As indicated above, the most effective way of increasing development activities and cost efficiency is to encourage local organizations to set priorities and implement projects prepared to fulfill local needs. However, the issue of local autonomy versus central control has been raised on different occasions. These aspects are not always taken into account when preparing programmes for development. . \\'This policy will focus mainly on the rights and responsibilities of local government agencies and matters relating to direct involvement of the local people. 1. Plan Formulation and Implementation The local autonomous bodies, established under the laws governing local development (such as Village Development Committee Act, Municipality Act, District Development Committee Act) , will be given complete freedom of operation. The elected representatives of the District Development Committee will be responsible for all activities related to the social and economic development of the District. Similarly, the elected representatives of the municipality will co-ordinate the programmes implemented within the municipal area and maintain contact with the District Development Committee for all district-level programmes. The elected representatives of the Village Development Committee will also be responsible for implementing and co-ordinating the programmes within the village area. In matters of local development, HMG will only have a supportive role of monitoring, supervision and co-ordination. In this context, the non-government organizations and the private sector will be encouraged to provide their services for productive purposes. The central government will accordingly assist and inspire the local people to make decisions that can be effective in implementing local development programmes. This will be the basis for the central government assistance to local development. A local-level project that is implemented either with foreign assistance or with HMG funds will be classified as a local level project if this can be implemented by local agencies or is not of national importance. Any district-level project that is implemented within one or more districts will also be classified as a local level project. HMG will provide necessary assistance to promote district-level co-operative efforts in development. If a local development project requires an international tender for its implementation, the tender will be issued at the central level but the project will still be recognized as a local level project. The local-level government offices involved in implementing the district or municipal-level projects will be accountable to the District Development Committee or the municipality. All local development activities run by these offices will be under the supervision of the District Development Committee and the municipality. In case the District Development Committee, the Municipality or the Village Development Committee requires technical assistance for development works, they can arrange this through direct contract systems. 2. Control of Local and Central Investments through Local Budgets It is possible to increase implementation capacity, encourage leadership and increase productivity through greater public participation if the local political leadership is directly and fully responsible to people. The right to make decisions on local-level development expenditure is a basic factor of local autonomy in a decentralized system. All the authority relating to local budgeting, accounting and personnel will be entrusted to the District Development Committee, Village Development Committee and the Municipality within the next two years. Necessary amendments will be made in the pre sent laws to implement these provisions. The central government will continue to provide grants and loans to support local development projects. The development grants will be made available in the following ways. A Local Development Fund will be established to provide block grants to local agencies for the development of districts, towns or villages. Apart from the provision that no part of the grant may be spent for administrative purposes, HMG will not specify any other condition on how the money is to b e used. This fund will be operated by the Ministry of Finance and the money will be transferred directly to local bodies without government intermediary agencies. The funds set up for specific purposes will be used to implement only the specific projects. The guidelines for the use of money by the local bodies will be issued by the concerned central body with the advice of the National Planning commission and the Ministry of Finance. The use of such funds may not be limited only to local government agencies. This fund can also be made available to non-governmental organizations operating at the local level. 3. Use of Revenue Realised from Local Tax or Duty The people living in towns and villages need to have sources of revenue in order to be independent of the central government. The municipalities and the Village Development Committees will be allowed to retain revenue raised by them to meet local needs, and to carry out local development projects. The taxes raised from the local people for services and use of resources will be used to operate expand and maintain local facilities. The statement of accounts will be open to public inspection, and a provision will be made for a central agency to audit the accounts at any time. 4. Conditions on Sanction of Grants The grants provided to the local agencies by the centre need to be related to the increment of revenue at the efforts made for the local level. The central grant will, thus, need to be regulated according to the local capacity to raise revenue. This is known as matching grant concept.. An appropriate policy will be formulated to ensure that the remote rural areas with less population and resources will receive the necessary grants. HMG will also make regular monitoring on how the central grant and the lo cal revenue are being used. The local agencies which make proper use of local resources and management will be provided with higher grant amounts. Besides the auditing of accounts, arrangements will be made for on-the-spot inspection of projects, and the facts obtained from such inspection will be made available to the general public. The foreign donor agencies that provide aid for local development purposes will be encouraged to contribute grants directly to local agencies rather than through ministries or other government departments. This arrangement will provide further incentive to local agencies including the non-government and private agencies to prepare and implement development programmes more effectively. 5. Implementation of Central Government Programmes in Local Areas The Central Government must cease to control the implementation of local development programmes. The Ministries and Departments at the central level have enough work of their own. A programme implemented at the national level is, however, the sole responsibility of the concerned Ministry. such national projects may include national level roads such as, East-West Highway, large-scale hydroelectric projects, central telecommunication network, etc. The majority of the sectoral programmes included in the Eighth Plan are national-level projects. Before implementing these projects, the Ministries concerned are expected to formulate implementation plans and provide guidelines and necessary support to local agencies at the District, Municipal and Village levels. A local development project, however, cannot be confined to local needs and aspirations. The planning for such a project should take into account the need for coordination between central policy and local needs. The use and management of material resources provided by the Centre will not be in the form of centrally managed project but will be the responsibility of the local agencies. The centre will also provide technical assistance for a more effective use of these materials. Integrated development needs to be viewed as an essential working principle of the decentralization process. The national-level projects as well as the local development programmes will be regarded as mutual ly-supportive in the overall development of the districts, towns and villages. The agency which prepares and implements a central-level project will maintain close contact with the local agencies during the course of its implementation. In case a local programme is contrary to the aims of the central project, the problem will be resolved through evaluation and mutual discussions. 6. The Organization and Functions of the users, Committee The locally elected representatives will encourage the local people to organize users committees, co-operative societies and othe r such organizations to fulfil the local development objectives. In this way the elected representatives and the political leaders can focus attention on how such organizations can contribute to local development. the practice of controlling these organizations by influential persons by taking the leadership or employing their own people or by any other means will be discouraged. If the users\\' committees are able to formulate and implement development programmes on their own without external financial assis tance, they will be allowed to do so. These committees or other agencies will be free to seek technical assistance from government organizations or other sources. The users\\' committees should concentrate on such development works that require only a little or no external assistance. Any external assistance, if required or available, will not require to be channelized to them through the centre. Organization of Users Committee representing the interest of the local people will be encouraged so that everyone can benefit from services such as good education, community health services, social and cultural activities, local roads, bridges, drinkingwater and other physical infrastructure for development. All users of the particular service will have to contribute for the operation and maintenance of the service. This Users\\' Committee will be given the authority and the responsibility to implement relevant programmes. The District Officers will provide necessary support to the Committees and be accountable to them, but they will not in any way control or interfere their programme activities. The Users\\' Committees will not be politicized. The membership to the Committee will not be based on the political alliance of the members. No person can be a Chairman of more than one Users\\' Committee at the same time, and a member of the Committee must be a resident of the area and one who enjoys the services provided by the said Committee. 7. Decentralisation and the Role of Non-governmental Organizations and the Private Sector The local agencies and Users\\' Committees need to be provided organizational and technical assistance for implementing development activities. They would also need the services of wholesalers, retailers, private firms and other financial institutions for the procurement of essential commodities and the sale of their products. If the local-level or -regional-level line Ministry offices are unable to provide the required services, the local bodies will advise the Users\\' Committee to seek assistance from nongovernmental organizations. Arrangements will be made for a nongovernmental organization or the private sector and the Users\\' Committee to enter into contracts system, the use of volunteer service and other management services. The local bodies also need to maintain close contacts with the private sector by exchange of necessary information. In addition to this, the private firms will be encouraged to implement essential economic programmes that would promote balanced economic development of the country. 8. Programme to Increase Efficiency of Local Bodies The main thrust of decentralisation is to upgrade the working capacity of local bodies under the leadership of local representatives. If the local bodies can develop a greater sense of responsibility through training of their members, the trust of the people and their participation can increase. The commitment to local development can be developed only through necessary reforms in the administrative and management systems. It is necessary to provide training to the locally elected representatives, the officials of the Users\\' Committee and the local people on how development programmes are to be implemented under a decentralised system. Various conferences, seminars and training programs will be organized in the districts to improve efficiency and work skills. Seminars and workshops of elected representatives of districts, to \\' wns and villages will be made more effective and compatible with decentralization policy. While formulating the training programmes for the local bodies, attempts will be made to have maximum participation of the concerned bodies in the choice of subjects and methods. In the past, the normal practice was to rely more on unproductive development speeches rather than on teaching of practical skills. While organizing training programmes for the local people associated with users groups, attention will be paid to their needs and reasonable financial and other incentives will also be provided. In the remote areas where most members of the Users\\' Committee may not be aware of the new concepts, preliminary seminars and workshops will I initially deal with known and simple work systems and then gradually cover higher level subject matters. Prices Background As the majority of the Nepalese people have low levels of income, it is essential to raise their living standards by controlling undue increase in prices. Toward this end, the national saving rate should increase so as to channelise it in the production sector. This has increased the net foreign assets and the money supply on the one hand and on the other hand, the high rate of increase in the loans to the government and the private sectors from the banking sector has also helped to increase the monetary expansion. Moreover, the rate of inflation has been increasing continuously due to slow increase in the production of the essential commodities in relation to increase in the money supply. In order to address this situation, the Eighth Plan has adopted policies to maintain a balance between demand and supply by increasing production and productivity. Nepal being a small land-locked country and as it has to depend on foreign trade for its economic development, the international and particularly, the Indian inflation rate has direct or indirect impact on its inflation rate. Nepal\\'s price situation needs to be observed in this context. Progress during the Seventh Plan During the Seventh Plan (fiscal year 1985/86 to 1989/90), there was a great pressure on the price level. In the first year of this plan, the national urban consumer price index was increased by 15.8 percent. During the entire plan period, the average annual price index increment rate remained at 11.9 percent. The internal causes for this high rate of price increment was due to the devaluation of the Nepalese currency by 14.7 percent, the high rate of increase in the money supply, gradual increase in the prices of goods and services produced by the government enterprises and private sectors; and an increase in tariffs, sales taxes and excise duties, etc. In the same way, the increase in the price level in the international market and particularly in India put a great pressure on the price level in the Seventh Plan period. Price Situation during the Interim Year After the completion of the Seventh Plan in 1989/90, the following two fiscal years; 1990/91 and 1991/92 were the years of plan holidays. After the collapse of Panchayat System and the establishment of a democratic government in the month of April,1990, the improvement in the relation between Nepal and India made a favourable impact on the price situation which made the country able to maintain the inflation rate at 9.8 percent in the fiscal year 1990/91. The causes of this high rate of inflation was due to the devaluation of the Nepalese currency against other convertible currencies by 20.9 percent during the last week of June 1991, the increase in the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods imported from the third countries following the adoption of partial convertibility of Nepalese currency with other convertible foreign currencies in the month of February,1992, decrease in agriculture production due to unfavourable monsoon, and price increases in goods and services produced by government and private sectors industries, etc. Policies An increase of small percentage in the price level is warranted in the course of the country\\'s economic development. However, an undue rise in the price level will have an adverse effect on the country\\'s economic development. Considering the possible negative effects on the economic development of the country in either condition, the rise and fall in prices must be limited to a certain extent. Price policies in the Eighth Plan will be as follows: 1. In keeping with liberal policies designed to encourage development in the economic sector, pressure on prices will be minimised by involving the private sector in production and distribution system. 2. Line ministries will ma ke a listing of daily consumer essentials in order to facilitate regularity in the supply of domestic produce and imported items (such as rice, pulses, spices, sugar, milk, salt and kerosene, etc.). Line ministries will also develop reliable statistics relating to domestic production, demand, surplus/deficit of the listed items and partial or full import requirements. On the basis of such statistics, policies will be adopted to maintain prices at desired levels by ensuring regularity in the supply management of necessary goods. But these items were smuggled out of the country due to the lack of a control mechanism along the border. When large scale smuggling led to a deficit in supplies within the country, these same goods were then imported at higher prices, leading to increased pressure on domestic prices. The government will observe tight controls in border areas to discourage unauthorised trade. 4. Stock ceilings will be enforced among mill owners, wholesale and retail traders to break the present monopoly of large traders in the foodgrain trade. To roster a liberal economy, a competitive atmosphere will be created where cooperatives and the private sector will be involved to the maximum possible extent in the trade of essential commodities. The role of Nepal Food Corporation in the supply of essential commodities to remote areas will be further intensified in light of\\' the small number of private sector entrepreneurs willing to undertake the job, 6. The practice of giving subsidies by the government to recover losses incurred while fixing the prices of goods by the government such as foodgrains, chemical fertilizers and petroleum products will be gradually eliminated In order to roster favourable effects on prices through the healthy and competitive involvement of\\' the private sector and cooperatives, the monopoly of public enterprises in the import and distribution of these goods will be discontinued. 7. As the expansion in money supply has also contributed to price rises in the past, the rate of expansion in money supply will be kept within limits, in consideration of economic stability. 8. As recurring government budget deficits were among the main reasons behind the rapid expansion of money supply, attempts will be made in the coming years to keep budgetary deficits within stipulated limits. 9. While efforts will be made to ensure regularity in supply management to increase internal production, policies will be adopted to import deficit items from cheapest possible sources. Measures will also be introduced to eliminate differences in import prices arising from varied rates if) customs tariff. 10. The price level will not be allowed to increase beyond 9.0 percent on an average during the plan period. Financial Resource Mobilisation The policy of financial resource mobilisation has an important role in achieving the objectives envisaged by the Eighth Plan. To achieve these objectives, the increase in share of investment in Gross Domestic Product of the economy is needed. In addition, it is equally necessary that the investment structure also takes a directional change favourable to the economic and social development efforts of the country. Furthermore, in the context of the liberal economic policy adopted by the nation, the formulation of a policy on financial resource mobilisation has become necessary to orient the available government and non-government sector\\'s economic resources towards right direction. The mobilisation of financial resources with due attention to the interrelationships among various macro-economic policies for the maximum utilisation of\\' the opportunities of development generated by the liberal economic policy and an increase in the Gross Domestic Saving rate in the economy have become necessary for development. This policy has been formulated taking these facts into consideration. Existing Challenges Although the Seventh Plan (1984/85 - 1989/90) had stressed on resource mobilisation for increasing investment, it failed to achieve the targeted progress. This led to the emergence of the following problems in the mobilisation of the resources. Nepal joined the rank of those countries which mobilises low total revenue in the share of\\' the Gross Domestic Product. In the fiscal year 1984/85 the tax revenue constituted 7.1 percent and the non-tax revenue 1.7 percent and thus, the total revenue comprised 8.8 percent of the GDP In the fiscal year 1989/90, the share of total revenue in the GDP reached 10.2 percent with the tax revenue contributing 8.0 percent. and the non-tax revenue 2.2 percent. In the same way the revised estimate for 1991/92 shows the total revenue will stand at 10.2 percent with tax revenue contributing 7.7 percent and non-tax revenue 2.5 percent. This situation evidently vindicates the need for increasing the quantity of the mobilisation of the revenue. In 1984/85, the share of the regular expenditure in the GDP was 6.5 percent, which increased to 7.3 percent in 1989/90. In the fiscal year 1991/92, the revised estimate of this expenditure is 7.4 percent, This increase in regular expenditure stalled any possible positive impact on revenue savings. The revenue savings stood at 2.3 percent of GDP in 1984/85, which remained at 2.9 percent in 1989/90. In the fiscal year 1991/92, the revised estimate for this savings is 2.8 percent of the GDP. Thus, without changing the present revenue savings ratio, there exist few possibilities to bring about any favourable changes in the government financial position. Because of the absence of desirable changes in the revenue savings, the deficit finance mobilisation has emerged as a permanent mechanism of resource mobilisation to general resources for the growing development expenditure. The share of deficit finance in GDP was 4.1 percent in 1984/85 and it remained at 2.7 percent in 1989/90. The revised estimate of this share in 1991/92 is 1.0 percent. However, if enough resources are not mobilized through revenue and foreign assistance, the government\\'s dependence on deficit finance will remain a characteristic feature. Thus, it appears that the deficit finance had exerted lower pressure on the non -banking sector than on the banking sector in the past, which clearly indicates the prevalence of a situation of an undesirable competition between the government and private sectors. Increased Reliance on External Resources: Because of the insufficiency of internal resource mobilisation, the reliance on external resources for financing the development expenditures grew heavily. In 1984/85, while the foreign assistance contributed 48.8 percent to the total development expenditure, this contribution increased to 61.1 percent in 1989/90. The share of foreign assistance it development expenditure decreased to 52.7 percent in 1990/91, but it will be salutary to further decrease its share in the years to come. It is certainly not desirable to depend excessively on foreign assistance for our development efforts. In the foreign esources front, the disparity between foreign assistance commitments and its actual utilisation has become a matter of concern. The actual utilisation of foreign assistance in 1984/85 stood at 44.7 percent of the commitments, which decreased to 40.7 percent in 1989/901. Thus, the deficiency in the absorptive capacity has emerged as a problem than the insufficiency in the external resource mobilisation. Predominance of Loans in Total Foreign Assistance: During the Seventh Plan period, the loans had a predominant share in the total foreign assistance. The share of loans in foreign assistance in 1984/85 stood at 65.5 percent, which further increased to 72.0 percent in 1989/90. In the fiscal year 1990/91, this share went upto 77.8 percent. The main problems include the lack of timely and procedural reforms in the prevailing revenue regime, revenue pilferage allegedly occurring in large amounts, Darrow revenue bases lack of training and skills anion.- employee.,;, low flexibility in revenue regime failure to use the external resources fully,etc. These problems will be gradually removed and ill order to generate revenue for maintaining a high and sustainable rate of investment the following additional resource mobilisation policies will be adopted during file Eighth Plan period. Objectives: The main objectives of the resource mobilization policy it) the Eighth Plan will he the followings: 1 . To assist in increasing the Gross Dome stic Saving Rate by changing the unnecessary and inappropriate consumption patterns 2. To create a conducive atmosphere for channelling the investment to productive sectors by raising the total investment growth rate by 3.0 percentage points during the plan period. 3. To avail regular Supply of financial resources ill required quantity in order to carry oil with development activities in kit) uninterrupted and sustainable manner 4. TO Make efforts for efficient mobilization of internal resources and to make appropriate and optimum utilisation of foreign assistance. 5. To utilise the internal and external resources in a complementary perspective taking their interrelationships into consideration. These objectives have been taken into account In tile formulation Of the policy of fanancial resouree mobilisation, Which encompasses the mobilisation of both internal and external resources. Policy Based Programmes 1 \\tInternal Re-source Mobilisation: The mobilisation of internal resources will be emphasized for meeting the need of\\' increased investment for development works and for gradually replacing the foreign assistance. The following special efforts will be made to bring about a structural change in the internal resource mobilization. (a) In the tax revenue front, the tax system will be made simple and extensive by making appropriate changes in the structure ol the tax system. The local and central level taxes will be clearly defined in the plan period. (b) \\tBy reviewing the purposes of various taxes, any vague and multi faceted purposes will be replaced by one purpose for one specific tax. (c) \\tIn the context of the agriculture sector not having been brought within the domain of the tax regime, an appropriate tax system will be developed and implemented with the objective of commercialising the agriculture sector. (e) \\tWhile excise duty will be limited to some specific items the excise system will be modified in keeping wit h the liberal economic policies adopted by the government. (I) \\tExtensive reforms will he made in customs to bring about uniformity in tariff\\' rat\" and necessary arrangements will be made to bring the tariff system in line with international conventions. (g) \\tThe prevailing income tax rates will be reformed, simplified and extended. (h) \\tLand revenue will be reviewed and gradually developed as a local resource. (i) \\tWealth tax will be further refined and made more practical in line with social justice. (j) \\tReforms will be made in revenue administration. Organizing a separate administrative set-up in the revenue sector, it will be made more scientific, efficient and effective. Simplification, clarity, transparency and efficacy will be infused into the tax and non-tax administration. At the same time, necessary measures will be adopted to minimize revenue pilferage. Training programmes will be conducted to strengthen the revenue administration and make it more efficient. At the same time, the organisational structures of administrative agencies will be further strengthened and necessary studies and reviews will be conducted. These changes will impart more flexibility to the revenue structure and especially to the taxation system and augment revenue collection. At the same time, these measures will contribute to production growth by encouraging the private sector savings and investments. These arrangements will increase the share of direct taxes in the total tax revenue collection, which is expected to bring about sustainability in the mobilisation of internal resources by reorienting revenue collection presently based heavily on external trade towards internal production. The non-tax revenue includes the income from the selling of government goods and services, profit, principal and interest. Prices of such goods and services will be fixed in accordance with the cost of production and by maintaining quality standards of these goods and services. Such services will be extended on the basis of their investment cost and their rates will be reviewed periodically. 2. External Resource Mobilisation 2.1 \\tEmphasis will be laid on maximum increase in the utilization or productivity of resources obtained from external sources. 2.2 \\tSpecial efforts will be made to utilise the available resources as the inability to utilise them has been a bigger problem than the mobilisation of additional external resources. 2.3 \\tForeign loan assistance will be drawn only for areas accorded priority by government and the role of government will remain dominant in the formulation and execution of such projects. 2.4 \\tThe selection of projects for external assistance will be made in specific areas identified by the plan in terms of priority. 2.5 \\tForeign loans will be approved only for productive programmes and for other programmes external grants will be mobilised as far as possible. 2.6 \\tCommercial loans will not be accepted in normal circumstances. they may be accepted only in exceptional situations depending on the nature of the project. 2.7 \\tNecessary arrangements will be made for the private sector, if it seeks to mobilise foreign loan investment at its own liability. 2.8 \\tProvisions will be made to avoid duplication and to increase the utility of assistance received from international organisations by allowing its use with the participation of the private sector or through other organisations only in areas specified by the plan. 2.9 \\tSpecial attention will be paid to subjectwise and countrywise reconciliation of the foreign assistance in order to ensure the initiation and completion of the foreign aided projects according to the programmes fixed in advance. The existing system of aid consortium will be utilised to the maximum to mobilise the aid commitments from international agencies and foreign countries in a coordinated fashion. 2.10 \\tAn estimation of the internal and external resources will be made for three years for the main projects being operated under foreign assistance to eliminate the disparity between the available external resources and their utilization. The above mentioned policy based programmes will contribute substantially to achieve a sustainable growth rate in economy during the Eighth Plan by facilitating the effective utilisation of external resources. Money, Banking and Credit Monetary and credit management aspects have their own peculiar significance in the macro-economic management. In monetary management system , on the one hand, there is a need to orient the quantity of money supply in accordance with the actual demand of the economy on regular basis. On the other hand, the flow of financial resources in credit management system cannot be left to the discretion of commercial banks and financial institutions, it is also necessary to direct the flow of these resources in greater quantities to the socially debilitated but productive and priority-accorded sectors. In the context of Nepal having adopted an open economy, an excessive level of liquidity will initially exert pressure on the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserve and subsequently cause adverse effects on the domestic price situation. The sustainable economic growth can only be achieved if the monetary balance is maintained. Another important objective of monetary management is to achieve maximum mobilisation of internal resources. The monetary policy needs to be oriented towards encouraging the people to save through the creation of a competitive environment among banks and financial institutions and motivating the desirous entrepreneurs to mobilise the available resources through the collection of\\' the scattered savings in production and employment generating programme in the country. In this perspective, it is necessary along with a planned process of economic development to initiate programmes that can create new financial bases for the economy, consolidate the existing ones and encourage healthy competition. A review of the requirements and availability of resources reveals that there is a tremendous resource gap between resource requirements arid its availability in the country; this is indeed indicative of the fact that a large share of private savings is still lying outside the domain of institutional systems, In this context, an efficient mobilisation of internal resources can further enhance the participation of the private sector in the economic development of the nation. Current Challenges in the Monetary Sector It is necessary to Control the rate of monetary expansion in harmony with the development of\\' the real sector in order to maintain internal and external balance in the economy but. this has not, been achieved as yet The main factors contributing to the Prevalence Of this Situation are (a) failure to minimize the role of\\' the government, (b) continued increase in net, foreign assets leading to increase in liquidity, (c) failure to enhance resource mobilization by banks and institution it) a warranyed manner, (d) the position of the money market and the scarcity of alternative monetary tools, (e) lack of dynamism in the capital market, and (f) the absence of a competitive environment. Over the recent years, there were some efforts made to prevent the government sector from becoming a cause for monetary expansion by gradually limiting its role but there has not been any significant decline in the government role except in a very few instances. The present government has adopted the policy of limiting the role of the government gradually to prevent it from causing monetary expansion and developing the private sector as the backbone of the economy. In this context, it is incumbent upon HMG to observe strict monetary discipline. The continued growth in net foreign exchange assets and the subsequent liquidity generated by this have become the main factors causing monetary expansion. There have not developed any effective measures to counteract the adverse impact of the above mentioned growth on monetary liquidity. The central bank can issue or sell government treasury bills or Nepal Rastra Bank bonds under its ownership in order to control the monetary expansion created by the increased foreign exchange reserve. It is the repayment of long term external loans and the adoption of a flexible import policy that can possibly remedy this adverse effect of increased reserve. However, this requires the identification of an appropriate level of foreign exchange reserve. One of the main reasons behind the failure to achieve monetary stability is the lack of warranted increase in mobilisation of internal resources by banks and financial institutions. With the objective of enhancing the efficiency of capital through healthy competition among financial institutions and thus achieving maximum utilization of internal resources, the Nepal Rastra Bank gradually liberalised the bank\\'s interest rates and allowed full autonomy in this respect in August, 1989. This policy of independent interest rates was expected to reduce the disparity between deposits and credit through an increased rate of interest on the deposits but this, too, did not materialise. Consequently, the Nepal Rastra Bank adopted an increment of 2 percentage points in the bank rate for the commercial banks to adopt an expensive monetary policy. The implementation of this policy also could not raise the interest rates as expected. The existing banks and financial institutions in the country have not been able to undertake the functions of mobilising the deposits, increasing the flow of credit disbursement by identifying potential sectors for investments, developing new saving schemes, and creating a favourable environment to win the confidence of the general public in the banking system. Consequently, the banking sector has not been able to develop a profound financial intensity. A greater proportion of financial assets in Gross National Income alone can ensure the efficacy of monetary policies, and in this context, it is essential for the banks and financial institutions to create an atmosphere conducive to financial development. Other factors preventing the monetary development and stability are the preliminary stage of the money market and the lack of proper monetary tools. The money market even after having traversed through a long stretch of planned economic development has remained in its rudimentary stage. There exist severely limited alternative monetary instruments in the money market to facilitate the investors to make use of their savings. The government treasury bills and the central bank securities are only short term investment expedients to the institutional investors. The market for call money has not shown a favourable development either. In this situation it has become imperative to make appropriate arrangements to develop new alternative instruments to infuse dynamism into the money market. It requires a dynamic capital market to mobilise the internal resources and attain a favourable economic growth rate. Our capital market, however, is still in a preliminary stage. The Security Exchange Centre has not been able to arrange any institutional brokers, nor has it been able to manage swiftly the issuance and sale of\\' shares and bonds of\\' industrial units. It is primarily concentrated in operating a second market for especially government securities. Consequently, the capital market has not been able to mobilise the internal resources in expected quantities. The absence of requisite financial development even after a long period of planned economic development efforts can be attributed to the lack of a competitive spirit among banks and financial institutions. It is necessary to develop new financial institutions, leasing companies, banks in the private sector or with joint foreign investment and other specialized agencies for the creation of a competitive environment. These arrangements can develop the prerequisite infrastructure for the creation of a healthy competitive atmosphere and only then can a systematic utlisation of the savings scattered among the general public be assured. The rural branches of commercial banks opened in the rural areas of Nepal do not seem to have activated their role effectively in deposit mobilisation and loan distribution. In view of the contradictory situation where the ratio of a banking office and population points towards the lack of adequate number of branches of commercial banks on one hand, and the existing branches have failed to deliver results, on the other, the banking sector and credit system of ours appear to be fraught with challenges. The unorganised market appears to be playing a role greater than that of the institutional market in meeting the credit needs; this situation seems to have minimised the contextual importance of interest rates and credit policies. The great disparities between the interest rates of institutional and unorganised market have evidently created the existence of a dual credit system. As long as this dual system continues, the efficacy of the credit system and monetary policy naturally becomes reduced. To solve the above problems, it is necessary to further extend the banking system. Along with establishing new branches of banks and financial institutions, the existing branches need to be properly developed and expanded. By developing new monetary and fiscal tools and providing returns to these savings the financial saving should , thus, be made more attractive in comparison to investment in other unproductive assets. This also requires arrangements for appropriate interest rate structure and grades, otherwise the financial savings may not grow as expected. Increased financial savings alone will not be sufficient, it will be necessary to channel them to productive employment oriented sectors. This again calls for proper identification of viable projects and fulfillment of an adequate loan demand of the entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs will be obliged to resort to borrowings from the unorganised market to fulfil their needs, if they have to encounter various cumbersome procedures and hindrances in obtaining loans and also if the loans are not available in time in sufficient amounts. As regards credit utilisation, the commercial banks have not been able to make available credit facilities in the priorities sectors as targeted. The commercial banks have failed, in particular, to identify viable agricultural, cottage and small scale projects and attract entrepreneurs towards them. However, without the promotion of such activities, the development of one of the poorest agricultural nations like Nepal does not seem to be an eventual possibility at all. A healthy development of the financial sector and an additional increase in the income of the common people can create a stronger base for additional investment in development activities through the enhanced financial savings accumulated in the banks. It is necessary to further motivate the commercial banks towards this end. The disparity between the rate of interest offered on deposits and the one charged on loans reflects the efficiency of the financial sector. This disparity is of a higher degree in Nepal. This has given rise to a situation where on the one hand, the deposit mobilisation has not occurred as expected and, on the other, there looms in the horizon the fear of credit facilities becoming more expensive. To remedy this situation, the banks need to control their overhead costs, lighten the burden of redundant staff and render the banking activities more efficient and cost effective through the utilization of new, innovative tools and technologies. It is equally important in this context to observe strict financial discipline and avoid red-tapism and procrastination in making policy decisions and in working procedures. Monetary and Credit Programme in the Eighth Plan In view of the significant role of the banks and financial institutions in resource mobilisation, it is absolutely a prerequisite condition to enhance the efficiency and Soundness of the banking and financial sectors. The banking promotion and credit programmes of the Eighth Plan have been formulated with a view to increasing the employment opportunities the productive base of the economy- through the mobilisation of resources and consolidation of their proper utifisation. 1. Utilisation of Indirect Monetary Instruments Nepal has now adopted a liberal economic system. The banking and monetary policies also have been so trained that they reconcile with this liberal policy. Accordingly the desirable standards of monetary and banking resources will be determined wit h the help of indirect instruments without, any direct interference. With the objective of assisting ill the refinement of excessive liquidity observed in the economy, a liquidity proportion of 36 percent was fixed with arrangements for cash balance to be compulsorily available to the tune of 12 percent of the deposits and 24 percent of total deposits to be invested in government treasury bills or bonds issued by the central bank. The monetary sector will instead accord preference to open market techniques in order to assist in the macro economic management. In the event of an excessive demand for financial resources in the economy, the Nepal Rastra Bank will reduce the liquidity through the sale of treasury bills or bonds issued by His Majesty\\'s Government or the bank itself. The Nepal Rastra bank when bringing about changes in the bank rates as an indirect monetary instruments will inform the banks, financial institution and the general public about the nature of\\' the monetary policy, whether it is expansionary or concretionary. 2. \\tCredit Extension to Priority-Sectors The present provision for a bank to extend a specified proportion of total credit outlay to priority sectors calls for a review in the present context of the liberal economic and monetary policies. The banks are allowed to use their own discretion whether to extend credit facility to such sectors to the tune of\\' 12 percent of the total credit in the present system. However, in spite of adopting the liberal policy, the concept of priority sectors and a directed flow of financial resources to them cannot be totally forsaken in view of the great need of capital among the skilled and enthusiastic entrepreneurs with meager income and, above all, the government\\'s commitment to development of the rural sector. Therefore, it is targeted to establish separate rural development banks on a regional basis solely for the development of the rural sector. These banks will function as specialized agencies to channelize the flow of credit to the priority sectors. A detailed programme in this regard will be put forth for implementation within the initial years of the Eighth Plan. 3. Formulation of Monetary Programme An efficient utilisation of resources is equally as important as the arrangement of resources for economic management. Therefore, internal and external stability in using financial resources needs to be specially emphasized. In the Nepalese context, if there is a monetary or credit expansion beyond a sustainable limit, there will be an increase in the prices of goods and services on the domestic front, which will lead to increased import to meet the growing demand. This will adversely affect the balance of payments situation, deplete foreign exchange reserves and on the whole create imbalances in the external sector as a whole. To avoid the emergence of such situation in the economy, a monetary programme will be formulated on the basis of an extensive analysis of the economy at the beginning of every fiscal year by reconciling the physical sector and monetary or credit sector with each other for maintaining a balanced situation. Therefore, the growth rate of mo ney supply and credit structure will be determined in a manner compatible with the changes in different variables such as sustainable economic growth rate, inflation, and external situation etc. As stated above in the same context, monetary and credit management will be conducted by utilising indirect instruments. 4. Policy of Positive Rates of Interest Therefore, it is necessary for a policy on interest rates to be able to solve this problem, and efforts will be made to the fullest possible extent to make positive interest rates. Hence, the monetary and financial policies will be put into use in keeping with the same objective. 5. Government Role and Interference in Credit Management In one of the poorest nations like Nepal where there live a large section of population below the absolute poverty line it is necessary to enhance their productivity and increase employment opportunities for them. And, in the context of the changed economic policies, it becomes a national duty to make available some returns of development efforts to these people, too. The credit extension under various programmes to be conducted in the priority sector, in particular, needs to be directed mainly to these people alone. Our past experiences have demonstrated that a simple and convenient procurement of a loan is of greater significance than its rate of interest. This section of the population also should not be treated as an exception in the application of the technique of determining an interest rate on the basis of demand and supply situation. However, the creation of an environment in which there is an assurance of the credit facility is a prerequisite condition. The confidence of being able to obtain loans can infuse dynamism into the economic activities of these people, too. At the very initial stage of the implementation of the credit programmes in the Eighth Plan, special attention will be paid to the needs of the targeted groups and the utility of credit. 6. Total Bank Credit Structure In the past, a considerable share of the limited bank credit outlay was procured by the government. In consequence, the private sector was often deprived of the opportunity of any credit facility. Now, in the context of HMG pursuing a policy of fiscal discipline, the budget deficit has declined and the monetization of the deficit has been considerably minimized too. This trend will be continued during the Eighth Plan. Similarly, as the credit extension to public enterprises on government guarantee adversely affects the soundness of the financial institution and of the commercial banks in their finances, a policy will be adopted to follow the usual market techniques for providing loans to government undertakings. The banking sector will assist through credit extension in the efficiency and productivity enhancing activities of the private sector in domestic or foreign trade. 7. Expansion of Branch Offices The expansion of branches entails an unnecessary increased burden of expenditure on the commercial banks and financial institutions causing an adverse impact on their profits. In view of this experience, the branches will be extended on a commercial basis only to economically viable and appropriate places. Expanding the activities of the branches running in loss,\\' efforts will be made to operate them in profit. The branches which fail to show any profit, even after functional adjustments will either be merged with the nearest banking office or dissolved. However, appropriate programmes may be introduced to provide some banking services even in the areas without banking offices or without any feasibility of any economic activities expanding within a short period. These programmes may include the introduction of Post-Office Saving Bank, Mobile Savings Bank, Mobile Credit Bank and Cooperative programmes, etc. 8. Strengthening of Banking and Financial Institutions Necessary steps aimed at appropriate allocation of\\' Financial resources will be taken in the following subjects on the basis of the position of the economy. These steps will strengthen the financial position of the banks. Transparent rules on directed loans, b. \\tSufficiency of the deposits of banks and financial institutions, c. \\tSimplification and transparency of laws and regulations relating to banks and financial institutions, d. \\tA congenial situation for an entry of new financial institutions and the exit of existing ones, 0. Development of the second market, F. \\tDiversification in financial instruments, g. \\tNon interference in the activities of banks and financial institutions from the government. 9. Finance Company The establishment and development of finance companies will be emphasized for (fie creation and extension of a Competitive financial environment, Appropriate programmes will be formulated for a convenient supply of financial resources from banks to such financial institutions to meet their short term needs. In this context, the commercial banks should come to the aid of these institutions so that they may be able to mobilise their own medium and long-term resources in the future. The structure of a finance company determines the extent of its activities. Smaller companies of this nature will confine themselves to discounting the commercial bills, bills of exchange and cheques whereas the financing of long term projects will require the assistance of large companies. The Eighth Plan will launch programmes to establish and extend as far as possible such finance companies which may be capable of making arrangements for long term financial resources. 10. Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions In the present context of the commercial banks being the only prominent institutions in the Nepalese economy to mobilise the collection of scattered monetary savings among the common people, the establishment of financial institutions may provide further assistance in the monetary collection work. These financial institutions will, at the same time, be both competitive with and complementary to commercial banks. In urban sectors with sound financial bases the finance companies will compete with banks, but in areas with relatively scarce financial bases, these companies will play a role complementary to banking activities. These finance companies classified as non-banking agencies can engage in various activities including providing loans to clients for personal use and are thus provisioned under the Company Act. However, the Nepal Rastra Bank in the capacity of a monetary authority will inspect and supervise their activities in a subtle manner. Special provisions will be made in the early years of the Eighth Plan with regard to the framework of their sources and utilisation of resources in large urban areas and the rural sector. 11. \\tCredit Policy of Commercial Banks Improving upon the traditional collateral-oriented credit policy the commercial banks have now begun extending loans in accordance with the merit of the project or programme. This policy of programme oriented credit extension will be further encouraged. However, it is equally important to make this kind of credit extension risk-free for the commercial banks. Therefore, an efficient monitoring unit will be formed to supervise whether the extended credit is utilised productively and meaningfully in keeping with the purpose or not. A health report of the project will be prepared and made available. 12. Collateral Arrangements The practice of extending loan against collateral cannot be stopped immediately. Although the share of such loans in total bank credit extension can be lowered comparatively, providing loans on the collateral of gold and silver or food products has their significance in the economy. Therefore, the system of accepting the stock of products as collateral for loans needs to be encouraged. However, such loans will be extended only upon ascertaining the quality and quantity of products in the stock and making proper warehousing arrangements for them. 13. Computerization of Commercial Banks In the initial stage, computerization will entail additional expenditure and training in computer technology will be equally necessary. The replacement of traditional accounting system, auditing and supervision by a new technology may create a psychological impact among employees of their relative significance having been decreased. Therefore, the banks should proceed with computerization on a phased basis by emphasizing on the positive aspects of the computers that they do not make employees redundant but instead enhance the work quality, lighten the employees\\' operational burden and even create more personnel requirements through the expansion of the banking operation. The Eighth Plan will accordingly orient the banking business towards modern technology. 14. Strengthening of Institutional Intermediaries The availability of financial resources is a prerequisite for exploiting the possibilities of economic development. To expand the activities of the existing banks and financial institutions, it is necessary to augment the use of new instruments, to introduce new technology in their operation and to develop a new management system in their organisation. Moreover, it is also equally important to establish additional institutions in keeping with the demand of the economy. Therefore, these aspects will be given special emphasis in the Eighth Plan in order to achieve extensive financial soundness of the economy. Similarly, due attention will be paid to savings and credit management through the development and expansion of financial institutions. This will extend support to the efforts of controlling the rate of inflation. The organisational structures of various institutions will be reconciled with the emergent changes in the economic structure. 15. Establishment of a Rural Bank The activities of these banks will definitely support the programmes aimed at raising the standard of living of the people living in abject poverty below the absolute poverty line and reduce the regional disparities. These banks will operate in the rural sector and extend credit facilities to small and cottage industries, income generating and productive agricultural activities and small scale business and trade. Upon the establishment of these banks, various rural sector programmes such as priority sector credit and small farmer\\'s credit and those of the commercial banks, too, will be conducted through them. Capital Market In order to assist in the economic development of the country, it is very essential to develop a healthy capital market. The capital market provides an important base for the development of industry, commerce and the economy. The recent adoptions of liberal economic policies and privatisation programmes by His Majesty\\'s Government with the objective of involving extensive private sector participation in the Eighth Plan is expected to provide ample investment opportunities in the country and will help maximise the demand for capital. In this context, it will be necessary to develop and expand a healthy capital market. Hence, to set up the necessary infra -structure to achieve the aims of the Eighth Plan and to attain speedy economic development, capital market should be considered seriously and given priority. At present the expansion of capital market in Nepal is severely limited. On the one hand, there is a very limited growth of primary and secondary markets for shares, on the other, special institutions such as merchant banking which help in the execution of the capital market are still in their infancy. In the same manner, well established financial institutions like the provident fund and insurance corporations in the dearth of legal provisions have not been able to participate in the activities of the capital market arena. Investors also do not seem inclined to establish and manage their businesses in the form of public companies. These factors limit the capital market activities to the transaction of limited shares and government treasury bills and securities. Because of these reasons a proper infrastructure development for industrial occupations in the country has not taken place. To reform the existing situation in order to develop the capital market and to establish it as an institution it has become necessary to activate the role of financial institutions in the capital market. The establishment and development of a stock exchange centre and legal provisions to ensure its smooth functioning are also necessary. Condition of Capital Market during The Seventh Plan Period* Even though the national plans of the past did not contain comprehensive plans with regard to the security market, the working policies and programmes of the Security Exchange Centre were fixed for the Seventh Plan period (1985-90). The Centre\\'s strategies and programmes relating to the mobilization of Internal resources necessary in the process of industrialization, together with the institutional development of the private sector were formulated and implemented. The Seventh Plan aimed to mobilize capital through security market, involve public participation in the ownership of industrial and commercial enterprises, facilitate capital transactions by establishing a security exchange market and promoting professional brokers in the private sector. As per the stipulated programme for the Seventh Plan period, seventeen companies were targeted to be enlisted in the Centre and made eligible for security transactions. At the end of the plan, paid-up shares worth Rs 750 million were enlisted and their market value reached 1,620 million approximately. But the annual transaction of shares could not exceed RS. 30 million and remained minimum in relation to market value. Bonds issued by His Majesty\\'s Government were expected to record transactions worth Rs 1,600 million but government bond transaction exceeded Rs 3,000 million. In the process of collecting the necessary capital for the establishment and expansion of the industrial enterprises, and in giving the ordinary people the opportunity to participate, the Centre was involved in advising on the issuance of capital, its management, sales and warranty assurances. Eighteen companies were enlisted during the plan period. During this period, share capital worth over Rs 210 million was attracted towards organized investment through the market. It is estimated that by the end of the plan period the number of people investing in shares reached 37,000. Legal infrastructures were prepared to appoint brokers, conduct transactions, carry out monitoring and control of the development of the security market. In this plan period, the broker\\'s code of conduct and rules of transactions were formulated and presented to His Majesty\\'s Government for approval. During the Seventh Plan period the Centre made special efforts to inform investors, and the general public about the various aspects of the security market, the state of enlisted companies and the market and transaction values etc. Progress during Fiscal Year 1990/91 and 1991/92 In the first year of the planning holiday period five additional organized institutions were enlisted and during the first six months of the second year four more companies were enlisted. This raised the total number of companies eligible for transactions in the market to 50. Similarly, the market value of enlisted shares went up to Rs2,102.8 million. In the fiscal year 1990/91, government treasury bills worth Rs 910 million were transacted. In first half of fiscal year 1991/92 transactions worth Rs 142.5 million were made. In the primary issue market three institutions were provided consultancy services and one institution was assisted in issuing shares worth Rs8.9 million in the fiscal year 1990/91. During the first half of fiscal year 1991/92 three companies were provided consultancy services and the share s of one company were floated to acquire capital. Though the draft regulations pertaining to the appointment of professional brokers and rules of transactions in the security market were being refined by the concerned authorities, they could not be enforced due to the failure to obtain approval. Existing Problems in the Capital Market In the existing financial set-up, in addition to the Security Exchange Centre various Development Banks, Employees\\' Provident Fund, National Insurance Corporation function asinseparable units in the capital market. But the vacuum in the present financial structure needs to be filled by institutionally developing capital market institutions like investment companies, finance companies, leasing and housing finance in order to create a healthy, competitive financial structure. Despite past efforts, the capital market is still in its infancy due to the lack of coordination between planning, policy formulation and its implementation. The economy has not been able to derive synergistic benefits due to the division in the activities of units related to the capital market. Although the number and resources of commercial banks, development banks and other financial units have increased and developed, the acquired resources are not directed towards the capital market. The present financial institutions have been unable to carry out capital market activities such as merchant banking, the award of risk capital and professional brokerage in the security market, on a priority basis. Hire-purchase and other activities are fully lacking. Because of the inability of the established financial sector to the consumer needs, the \\'Upahaarl programmes, the \\'Dhukuti\\' programmes are being run unofficially. In this way, by the emergence of this sector, the resource mobilization and investment of the established sector have been directly affected resulting in a set-back in the financial structure. The industrialization of the country can be made possible only by timely checking the distortions arising out of the situation by the consolidation of the financial aspects together with the well planned development of the capital market. It is essential to pay attention to the consolidation and development of the capital market in order to fulfil the objectives of the Eighth Plan. Firstly, to realise the aims of the plan; the private sector must fulfil their responsibilities, necessary capital must be supplied to expedite industrial development and it is imperative that the capital market take up an active role supporting economic liberalization. The capital market is also a must for the privatization of public enterprises as well as for the development of the industrial occupation. Keeping in mind the present state of the capital market and the additional responsibilities entrusted by the plan, capital market planning needs to be formulated in such a manner that it solves the existing problems and challenges given below. 1. The organised financial sector in the country is oriented towards commercial banking. Its five commercial banks occupy more than three fourths of the financial sector\\'s total resources. The capital market being comparatively new and small, the balanced development of the financial sector has not occurred. 2. The present structure of the capital market is also mainly lending oriented. The security market is dominated by bonds and securities issued by His Majesty\\'s Government. Though the practice of floating shares by the organized sector is growing; the dearth of feasible projects and the lack of incentives to enter the capital market have prevented the security market from taking on a more active role. The only industrial bank has not been able to expand its operations due to limitations of resources. organizations, capable of mobilising resources such as the Employees\\' Provident Fund and Insurance companies limit their resources to government securities, bank deposits and loan extension and hence have not been able to influence institutional securities. The organized sector has not been able to become marketoriented and competitive because of the practice of meeting the financial requirements of the government institutions (which account for a major portion of the organized sector) from the budget. 3. The economy is significantly lacking in a number of institutions and activities which should be playing an active role in the capital market. Because of the insufficiency of institutions such as finance companies, leasing, housing finance, pension fund, hire purchase, merchant banking and investment banking; underwriting, lease, risk capital, dealer, market maker, brokering service and the like are also lacking. 4. The collection of capital by the issue of shares is not yet an established method of fund raising, nor has it been possible to bring out the differentiations in the nature of shares. The practice of speculating with investors\\' risk-bearing capacity and the expected returns; and issuing government bonds and shares on the basis of the speculations has not yet developed. Similarly, the practice of fulfilling the demand for capital by issuing accumulative, non-accumulative or convertible preference shares, debentures, floating rate bonds, etc. has not been developed. Government and non -government units do not issue shares in market. The tradition of companies accepting public deposits has not developed. In the same way, there is a lack of a unit with requisite policy programme to fix and coordinate the return rates of the capital market. 5. Keeping the well-being of investors in mind, it has become necessary to ensure the effective functioning of services rendered by the Security Exchange Centre; services like the new issues and their sales management, the establishment of secondary market and brokering services. There is the lack of a full- fledged powerful unit to conduct the capital market services on the basis of priority; there is concomitantly the lack of a mechanism which keeps a close watch in order to ensure a healthy controlled development, which declares disclosure standards, which gives policy directives and monitors to ensure a healthy market, and which safeguards the interests of investors and recommends necessary measures and gives right directions for their implementation. Because the environment in the secondary market is not conducive to the active participation of brokers, the scope of such markets is severely limited. This situation has not inspired the growth of even the primary market. Thus, the capital market, specially the stock market has remained small. 7. At present, there seems to be no unity and coordination among the units related to the capital market. Because the informal exchange of capital takes place in a bigger scale, capital is unavailable for larger projects. Similarly, because the capital market is not open to foreign investors and the circulation of capital and there is a lack of modernization in capital market activities, it has not been possible to direct the capital to come up. In view of the above-mentioned problems and challenges, the following objectives and programmes have been formulated for the capital market in the Eighth Plan. Objectives 1. An appropriate capital market will be developed in order to facilitate the accelerated growth of industry, trade, agriculture and other occupations. 2. To develop an effective and efficient institutional structure so that the capital market plays an enhanced and significant role in order to achieve a balanced development in the financial sector. 3. Creating an environment for the maximization of public investment, a significant portion of the private sector investment and the investment amount required by HMG in the form of internal loans within the plan period are to be raised through the issue of shares in the capital market. 4. To encourage the mobilization of financial resources through the official sector by developing a healthy capital market. Policies To attain the above mentioned objectives of the Eight Plan, the following policies will be adopted. 1. To issue securities such as shares, bonds and debentures fo r the mobilisation of funds, to protect and safeguard the rights and well-being of investors in shares, to issue license to centres involved in shares transactions; to follow up and supervise; to bring to public notice statistics related to organised econo mic and financial institutions; to state the responsibilities of these companies, organisations, the attached legal experts, accountants, etc, and all other activities concerned with capital are to be managed in an efficient manner by setting up a Securities Exchange Board in order to control the stock market. And in long term, the ownership and the functioning of the stock exchange will be transferred to the brokers of the private sector. An appropriate unit will be formed to generate the necessary additional capital for the expansion of market \\tfacilities. 3. In order to encourage the participation of Employees\\' Provident Fund, Insurance Companies, banks and financial institutions in the capital market, the required amendments to their acts and regulations will be made. Similarly, the dependence of private and public sector institutions, local units and development banks for medium and long term capital on His Majesty\\'s government will be reduced by issuing different types of shares to collect capital. Thus the development banks will be encouraged to raise capital from the general public. 4. To develop and extend the intermediary system of capital market, the involvement of financial institution will be encouraged in such activities as management of share issuance, guarantees, brokerage and the creation of market as well as in assisting the promotion of established institutions in such activities in the private sector so as to further consolidate primary and secondary markets. 5. Provision will be made to conduct regular training and seminars on various aspects of the security market such as project, company, and share evaluations, transaction of securities and management of the information system for financial entrepreneurs involved in various activities of the capital market. 6. The savings of those not willing to invest in ordinary shares or wishing only minimum risk in investments can be mobilized through many other specialized schemes under the various savings and investment plans by financial institutions. 7. Necessary ame ndments will be made in the existing act and rules pertaining to the capital market in accordance with the liberal policies mentioned in the objectives so as to develop the security market. In carrying out these amendments, necessary legal basis will be prepared to regulate unofficial financial programmes and to enable companies to easily issue debentures, acquire deposits and issue negotiable certificates of deposits. Appropriate amendments will also be made in the Company Act as well as other acts in order to protect the well being of small investors. 8. Necessary legal amendments will be made and programmes prepared and implemented so as to gradually pave the way for foreign investors to enter the security market. Similarly, efforts will be made to enhance public interest and faith in companies or institutions by developing a system of credit rating. This will assist companies to mobilize resources on the basis of public trust. The investments to be made in shares and information about the capital market will be widely disseminated and educational programmes will be conducted to promote interest in this field among the general public. 9. Increased capital shares of the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation will be issued in order to make investment possible in large projects. For this the collection of capital from the market will be encouraged. 10. The organizational and legal structures of the existing banks and financial institutions will be reviewed and the capital in the financial sector will be made to flow effectively towards productive projects through the medium of securities. 11. In the course of industrial development, the legal and administrative provisions relating to activities such as the liquidation of professional institutions, their dissolution, buy outs, mergers, fair trade practice, bankruptcy, property rights and transfer of rights will be improved and developed. Programmes 1. Necessary legal draft and organizational model will be prepared to establish the Security Exchange Board by developing legal and organizational basis to conduct and control the security market. Legal and organizational arrangement will be made to ensure that enlisted companies publish and specify the status of disclosures to the general public and to follow up on the same while issuing shares. 2. The present Security Exchange Centre will be established as a non-profit self regulatory stock exchange institution. The participation of the private sector will be gradually increased so as to develop the physical facilities necessary for stock exchange transactions. 3. The Employees\\' Provident Fund, insurance companies and other financial institutions will be encouraged to invest in shares, debentures and security bonds in order to attract the organized financial sector resources towards the security market. 4. To develop and expand the intermediary institutions and services of the capital market, the Citizens Investment Fund and other financial institutions will arrange primary issue guarantees and be involved in building up the brokerage market and other activities. There must also be provisions for reforms in the company acts and rules in order to encourage the establishment of financial companies. 5. Provisions will be made to train manpower in order to develop the security market. For this various saving programmes will be conducted by the Citizens\\' Investment Fund or institutions authorized to conduct such schemes so that these savings can be mobilized and invested in the organized sector and financial services will also be provided and profits distributed among the participants. After the relevant Trust Act is developed the institution that controls the security market will permit various trust companies to function. 7. The security market will be utilized for raising medium and long term capital. The policy of providing grants, loans and share capital to the institutions of His Majesty\\'s Government will be reviewed and the practice of issuing shares at competitive values will be encouraged. The tradition of issuing shares in order to acquire necessary means of investment will be further developed in organizations like the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and the Agriculture Development Bank. The possibilities of adopting the issuance of shares by 1 ocal urban units in their construction and development works will also be examined. 8. To regularize the financial activities in the informal sector and to channelize them towards the formal sector, the necessary legal basis and :institutional set-up will be provided. The necessary unit will be set up to make legal and administrative provisions related to activities like the liquidation of business enterprises, buy outs, mergers, fair trade practices, bankruptcies, property rights and the transfer of these rights. 9. The practice of raising public funds by companies will be promoted and effective legal and institutional provisions will be made to carry out proper mo nitoring of this activity. 10. The establishment and functioning of companies which involve extensive public participation will be encouraged. The existing system of registering companies separately in the industry and commerce departments will be reformed and a single registration unit established. In the process of these reforms, activities like the conversion of private companies into public ones, the merger of companies and the entry and exit of companies will be made clear, simple and effective. In companies that aim to establish themselves by mobilizing extensive public participation, the financial institutions can, by functioning as founders, adopt the policy of providing share capital and guarantee facilities. To impart dynamism to share transactions in the organized sector, the stock exchange will be operated exploring the feasibility of a Share Depository and Registration Unit. Public Enterprises and Privatisation Background Public enterprises were established as a strong means of development after the Second World War in developing countries. such enterprises were established in developed countries from the Eighteenth century. However, in the developing countries, constrained with the scarcity of capital and professional skills, the significance of such enterprises was evidently even greater; so in these countries, right from the infrastructural and service areas to the production and even distribution sectors, public enterprises were established. It was believed that the government should play a predominant role in national economic development especially in those developed and developing countries cast in the socialistic pattern. with this view, public enterprises were established in production, distribution and even in business sectors. Public enterprises were established in order to prepare infrastructure services, to produce the required goods in the country and to export, to help in controlling the price situation, to create opportunities for employment, to increase government revenues and to contribute significantly in the national development as well as to assist in the country\\'s economic advancement. In Nepal, the public enterprises were established in public services, industry, trade, finance and other sectors to create the infrastructure for basic services; and also because the private sector was seen as inefficient in important areas; the capital investment capability was low, and because technical know-how development was still in a very primary stage. After Nepal Bank Limited was established in 1954 as a public enterprise, other such enterprises like Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation also came into being. In the industrial sector also, industries like the Janakpur Cigarette Factory, Birgunj sugar Mill, and Bansbari Leather Shoe Factory were established in 1961. Subsequently, banks, business sector, telecommunication, electricity and water supply in the services sector; cement, bricks, medicines and textiles in the industrial sectors came into existence. In this way, at present sixty two different public enterprises are established in Nepal. Although the development of public enterprises has achieved the above mentioned aims by creating employment opportunities, increasing production in the country and providing the important basic services; the enterprises have not been functioning in an efficient manner. Despite the long term protection given to these public enterprises they have not been able to achieve financial capability and work efficiency and are still dependent upon government grants. So in order to enhance their efficiency, it has become necessary to think seriously about them. Upto the fiscal year 1990/91 His Majesty\\'s Government had invested a capital of Rs 6,303.2 million and loan investment worth Rs 15,584.2 million on the existing public enterprises. The enterprises which were audited in the fiscal year 1989/90 showed a loss of Rs 240 million, which increased upto Rs 1,870 million in the fiscal year 1990/91. From this, it has been evident that public enterprises have become a perpetual financial burden. As the average capacity utilization of these enterprises was only 52 percent and had mostly gone into loss, the capital grants to be given by HMG for functional and transportation expenses gradually increased to Rs 76,720 million in the fiscal year 1990/91. Since it has become necessary to enhance the working efficiency, to effect managerial reforms and to run these enterprises from the commercial point of view, it is necessary to analyze the nature of these enterprises and to privatize them. Where privatization is not possible, efficiency enhancement programmes must be introduced immediately. Past Efforts Keeping in mind the condition of public enterprises, His Majesty\\'s Government has initiated privatization efforts from this decade onwards. Privatization efforts had started even before this. For example, frequent efforts were made to sell the Balaju Textile Industry. However, besides the then lack of political commitment necessary for privatization, the faculty preparatory programme caused the privatization efforts end in a fiasco. Similarly, in the year 1985, His Majesty\\'s Government had made the decision to privatize one company every one month but implementation in this direction was not made. In the year 1988, HMG had taken the decision to sell 49 percent shares of the Birgunj Sugar Mill. in the same period, efforts to privatize the Himal cement Company also failed. , The of forts made by the National Industrial Development Corporation to hand over the shares under its ownership to the private sector could not succeed due to the lack of farsightedness. In 1989, His Majesty\\'s Government decided to privatize 50 percent shares of 30 public enterprises and a privatization committee was also formed. The said committees prepared a draft white paper and programme relating to privatization and submitted them to His Majesty\\'s Government after which no action was taken in the direction of privatization. Thus, due to incomplete and faulty preparations and the lack of necessary determination, the many efforts at privatization made in the past were unsuccessful. After the formation of the elected government, HMG decided to privatize three public enterprises in the fiscal year 1991/92. For the formulation of necessary policies relating to privatisation, a privatisation committee was set up under the Ministry of Finance, the Corporation Coordination Division with a special unit for privatization was formed and policies relating to privatization were also brought to public notice. Together with this, the decision to privatise the Harisiddhi Bricks and Tile Factory, the Bansbari Leather Shoe Factory and Bhrikuti Paper Mills was also made public. The above mentioned enterprises were put on sale by calling on open tenders, large scale negotiations were carried on with institutions interested in purchasing and the final eligible purchasers were awarded the deals. Thus, on the basis of the experience gained through the privatisation of these three corporations and keeping with the plan of pursuing the privatisation programme systematically, HMG has started to select other new corporations for privatisation. Although the establishment of public enterprises had greatly assisted in the country\\'s industrial and professional development, and helped to prepare the necessary institutional base, the enterprises themselves could not succeed. To accelerate the pace of national development it has become necessary to increase efficiency in all areas through proper and efficient management. Together with this it has become necessary to bring about changes in the structural framework of the corporations in order to enhance the standard of services rendered by them. Mainly, the following reasons make the privatisation of public enterprises a necessity; 1. By now HMG has made a credit extension of over Rs 15 billion and capital investments worth Rs6 billion on various public enterprises, yet the returns from these enterprises are negligible. Even to keep them functioning, the government has had to provide additional annual grants. 2. Because the corporations are tied up by various rules and regulations they lack necessary flexibility and, hence, the competitiveness. 3. Because most of the corporations are overstaffed, the expenditures are unduly high and their productivity and competitive capabilities are adversely affected. Therefore, they are not being able to provide expected services. 4. There is a lack of skilled professionals and responsible management in the corporations. 5. It has become necessary to direct the government resources more towards social welfare and other areas than to these enterprises and commercial sectors. Because or these reasons HMG has adopted the aim of privatising public enterprises. The objectives of privatisation are mainly concerned with the development of industry and business sectors, increment in productivity and efficiency, the mobilisation. of savings and increase in public participation in the commercial field. Objectives 1 \\tBy enhancing the efficiency and competitive ability of corporations, production and productivity will be increased along with the promotion of co-operatives. 2. Programmes to increase efficiency in both types of corporations which are not to be privatised and which are to be privatised in future are to be initiated and reorganization works for better management are to be conducted. Policies 1. A long-term strategy on privatisation will be devised. Corporations of industrial and business nature will be gradually privatised. All policies and. programmes relating to privatization will be made transparent. 2. The private sector will be allowed to operate projects related to public utility sector like hydroelectricity, drinking water and other public utility services but for the present, public enterprises set up in those areas will continue to operate in the government sector. 4. To privatise and to increase the efficiency in corporations, a central unit will be formed. This unit will conduct ail the works relating to privatisation with the support of concerned ministries. 5. The privatisation of public enterprises will be undertaken in groups such as those being privatised immediately, those to be privatised after a certain period of time, or those to be privatised after restructuring in the long-term. Necessary improvement programmes will be launched for corporations to be privatised later and not to be privatised at all. 6. In the process of privatisation, the evaluation will be made together with other necessary preparatory arrangements. Efforts will be made to increase public participation in the ownership as far as possible. In future it will be clearly stated whether a reduction in employees/labourers is possible or not, and in the case of having to reduce them, how much compensation they will be given. 7. Legal basis will be prepared for the privatisation of corporations, considering their structure. Those corporations, established through special legal provisions will be handed over through the company laws and privatised. 8. Public awareness programmes on privatization will also be launched. In the process of privatization, arrangements will also be made to involve the participation of employees and labourers. 9. In order to increase the efficiency of public enterprises which are not going to be privatised or which are going to be privatised in future; programmes related to organizational changes, financial and managerial reforms and top level managerial appointments will be conducted in order to create a responsible management. Programme Relating to Privatisation 1. On the basis of long term strategies relating to privatisation, the public enterprises to be privatised will be selected. In selecting the corporations to be privatised, priority will be given to the factors such as the public importance of the corporation, financial capacity, the need to increase the market guarantee factor, the need of special corporation and the future potential. Thus, corporations will be categorized into groups like those to be immediately privatised, those to be privatized on a medium term basis and those to be privatized on a long term basis or after restructuring. 2. As per the long term policy in the Eighth Plan; the corporations to be privatized will be selected and the necessary preparations and annual programmes will be formulated. At the same time, necessary reform programmes will be conducted for other corporations that are not going to be privatised. Those corporations, difficult to be reformed and where privatisation is not feasible, and which lack sufficient ground to function as corporations will be closed down. 3. While privatising, the nature and problems of corporations will be studied extensively and it will be decided whether they are to be fully sold, the government role is to be minimized by selling shares, or only the management is to be handed over. Along with this, appropriate evaluation and necessary preparatory arrangements will be completed. Such evaluation will be used as a basis for the corporations to be privatised. 4. Policy and programmes relating to the replacement, retraining and necessary compensation to be g iven to employees and labourers will be clarified and while privatizing these provisions will be implemented. Whether employees and labourers have to be reduced in future, and in the case of having to reduce them how much compensation can be given will be clearly specified. 5. The method of privatisation will be decided upon the needs of each corporations. While making decisions  in this manner, the economic condition of the corporation, the market factor, employment number and investment potential will be considered. 6. If a corporation is not possible to privatize in its present state, then the assets of such corporation may be sold or given on lease. And if it is not possible, then it will be closed down. 7. A legal basis will be prepared for the privatization according to the needs and structure of the corporations. Corporations set up through special legal provision will be handed over under the company law and privatized. 8. Public awareness programmes related to privatisation will be conducted in a massive scale and their utility will be brought to public notice. The main aim of privatization is to enhance the efficiency of corporations  for the speedy economic development of the country and to bring the public property under the management of the public, which will be properly publicized and broadcasted. Such funds will be used for future privatization purposes as well as to provide necessary compensations to employees and labourers. 10. In order to enable the employees and labourers to participate in the process of privatisation a certain share may be allocated for them. In case the employees and labourers do not accept the share, it will be publicly, or by other means sold and distributed. Provisions will be made for selling such share of the property to employees/labourers in installments or against deferred payment. 11. Large public enterprises can also be privatised on the basis of deferred payment. In such cases, the form of instalments and the initial instalment should also be clearly specified initially. 12. To successfully implement privatisation programmes, a privatisation commission as well as a committee of experts on privatisation will be formed and under. them privatisation works will be completed. In relation to Improvement of Efficiency in Public Enterprises which will not be Privatised or those which will be Privatised in the Future: 1. As the important service sectors such as electricity, water and communications can provide more services  in the form of public enterprises functioning under HMG, for the time being, efficiency enhancement programmes will be conducted in these types of corporations. 2. Public enterprises to be run by HMG will conduct programmes to increase efficiency in productivity, to make maximum use of available capabilities, to bring about reforms in management, to reduce expenditure and investment in unproductive and less beneficial sectors, and to organise the personnel systems. While conducting such programmes the professional management will also be involved. Reformistic action will be taken after a diagnostic studies of the present state of these enterprises. 31 \\tTo increase the efficiency of the corporations, expenditures will be deducted and to increase productivity by adoption of the cost-benefit approach, etc. will be implemented. 4. In order to increase productivity, programmes will be conducted to fully mobilize capacity utilization, to gradually use the appropriate technology, to bring about reforms in training and management, and to establish an appropriate pattern of working style. Management committees will be formed comprising mainly efficient and skilled persons representing the private sector or professional groups. A conducive environment will also be created to run the corporations in a well organised manner by appointing the chairman and the general manager on professional merit basis. 5. To create a competitive environment in areas where public enterprises enjoying monopoly, private sector will be given to operate similar units gradually. 6. Unnecessary and unproductive expenditures and investments will be cut down and expenditure control measures will be put into practice. The management will be provided with greater autonomy to run public enterprises. Government intervention in fixing prices will cease gradually. 7. An appropriace system of reward and punishment on the basis of efficiency enhancement works and their results will be introduced in the corporations. To make such a system function, its proper implementation will be encouraged. The management will be made responsible to ensure that work is carried out properly. 8. If necessary, public enterprises will be reorganized in the following manner: a. By floating the necessary capital. b. By reevaluating assets and loans. c By writing off the accumulated losses and creating new capital structure. d. By capitalizing the loans of the HMG e. By selling or leasing out unnecessary and useless property. L. By dividing the larger corporations in proper size and reorganizing them. By merging two or more corporations to function in a more successful manner, if deemed proper. h. By providing management contracts or memorandum of understanding to increase the efficiency of the selected corporations. i. By removing unnecessary manpower providing them with appropriate compensation upon  conducting necessary studies while reorganizing the corporations. j. By making efforts to improve the efficiency of corporations with the involvement of efficient and capable managers, besides the general manager, in other top management posts as required. k. By making this kind of appointment also through the lateral entry system. 1. Reorganising the Working committees by appointing professional and efficient directors in smaller corporations working committees. Institutional Arrangements The implementation and monitoring works relating to the strengthening of corporations, competence enhancement, new investment and the policy of privatization will be carried out by the Corporations Coordination Division of the Ministry of Finance, HMG, concerned ministries and corporations as per the guidelines of the Privatization Commission or the Experts committee on privatization. Development Administration Background An efficient administrative machinery is necessary for the timely completion of the nation\\'s development and construction works in order to respond to the growing desire for development and to avail the fruits of deve lopment to every household of the people. In order to incorporate and coordinate the technological advances in development and construction activities in this fast shrinking world, the administrative machinery must be strengthened in order to make it capable, powerful, prompt efficient as well as effective in the execution of its functions. For this, the administrative and technological capabilities in the upper level should be enhanced. It is well known that it will be difficult to implement the development and construction works effectively as desired in the absence of coordination between the needs of the administrative machinery and development and construction works. In this context, it has become very essential to reform the administrative machinery in accordance with the time. Although the slogan of calling for the effectiveness and reforms in administration was given from the very beginning of the development plan, the complaint that desired and impressive progress in this direction was not achieved holds ground in its own place. It is clear that the implementation of the country\\'s development plan according to its target has not been possible because, from the economic point of view, the administrative machinery is burdensome and unproductive; in its organizational aspects, difficult to manage and control; and from the service view-point, more government - oriented rather than people -oriented. The policy of implementing the recommendations of the administration reform commission will be gradually adopted with timely reforms in order to effect immediate reforms in a sick administration and to make it service oriented. The image of public administration is to be made neutral, fearless, impartial and it is to be rendered small and active. Giving priority to make the development administration strong and achievement oriented in the Eighth Plan period, the existing government administration units will be reformed in their organizational set-up functions, duties and system of functioning, administrative procedures and acts and rules pertaining to them. It is necessary to reform the procedure of formulating plans and* programmes in order to bring dynamism in development administration. In this process, legal rights will be devolved to villages, municipalities and district development committees to undertake responsibilities such as the formulation, implementation and evaluation of local level plans which aim to mobilise and involve local means and resources and to enhance local participation for local development works. For this, the centre will provide the necessary technology and technical assistance as well as help to strengthen the management. This will help to bring an end to the practice of demanding and approving adhoc programmes and budgets. The formulation and implementation of central level plans will be exclusively based on a programme oriented budget system for which the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment, benefit/cost ratio, work schedule, manpower management, provision of review and coordination between the centre and local units or its absence will provide the basis. The monitoring and evaluation of central level plans will be done within a specified time on a regular basis by consolidating and increasing the efficiency of the central organization\\'s planning and monitoring unit. The decision making process will be revamped by clearly defining the rights and responsibilities of all levels required for conducting administration at various levels and for formulating and implementing development and construction works. The practice of irrational transfers of civil servants involved in the implementation of development planning will be brought to an end. Keeping in view the effect on the projects due to delays in hand-over, take -over and audit clearance works, the work performance of the concerned civil servants will be linked to the evaluation process in order to ensure the timely execution of such works. In this context, on the one hand, efforts will be made to embrace austerity measures by enhancing the morale of civil servants, and on the other, transparent rules and regulations with reference to reward and punishment will be made to ensure strict enforcement of financial discipline. Legal measures to curb corruption will be reinforced. Another important aspect of public administration is the simplification of the decision making process. Therefore special emphasis will be given-by the central level to handover the responsibility and to delegate authority at the implementing stage. The important aspects of development administration are to complete the construction and development works in a coordinated manner, to develop the necessary capabilities and to increase the productivity of the civil servants. In order to achieve these qualities, physical, psychological, economic, social and legal provisions have to be strengthened. Therefore, in the Eighth Plan period matters pertaining to the creation of posts, transfers, training, work performance, evaluation, promotions, salaries and allowances and other facilities as well as matters concerned with level, rank and service have been clearly stated in order to build prestigious ima ge of the public administration. According to the recommendations of the pay commission, periodic revisions will be made in salaries and allowances, and legal discrepancies in relation to civil service will be removed through democratic and liberal act and rules. In order to remove the delay and slackness, decisions motivated by vested interest, irregularities and corruptions from the administrative sector, clear legal provisions will be made and strictly enforced. Considering the compulsion to remain in a single post for years in the civil service due to the absence of career development opportunities, steps will be taken to provide these opportunities so that the competence and morale does not get reduced. Lower level civil servants managing their livelihood within their limited incomes will be provided service opportunities near their home districts. Special training will be provided to civil servants attached to local units in order to make them more service oriented, honest and dutiful. In order to make development administration efficient, the decision making process relating to financial matters such as contract deals, procurement and supply, giving priorities to national products, the process of acquisition of land and technical dealings will be simplified by entrusting the responsibility to the concerned responsible officials. Bookkeeping and accounting systems will be gradually improved. The management of accounting system will be strengthened. Keeping in view the problems of accumulating irregularities arising out of the failure to carry out timely audits, a system will be developed wherein civil servants accountable for expenditures, will be made responsible to ensure that timely audit are conducted. The practicalities of implementing foreign aided projects will be considered prior to agreement, and efforts will be made to discourage obstruction in matters relating to the release of funds and expenditures after the agreement has been reached. The constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990, has stipulated on matters relating to departmental punishments that the proposed punishment against any non-gazetted civil servants also needs prior approval of the Public Service Commission. Due to this, the responsibilities of the Public Service Commission have increased. The administration can be made competent only by selecting appropriate people by bringing about timely reforms in the process of assessing the suitability, the bases for promotions and the examination system and procedures concerning civil servants. The Public Service Commission will be provided necessary assistance in order to strengthen these aspects. A policy will be adopted to strengthen the managemen t of the Public Service Commission by improving its physical condition. The practice of the recruitment of employees on bases other than the principles stated by the public service commission will be made punishable. The most powerful means of rendering the administration efficient are the enhancement of knowledge and skill which can, only be attained through training. Reforms are equally needed in training policies as well as procedures. The training programmes will be made effective by establishing upon conducting a relevant study on umbrella organis ation, if necessary, to maintain the quality of and balance as well as coordination among training programmes. These training casetres will be encouraged to help increase the management capabilities of non government organizations. In the Eighth Plan the structure of the central organizations will be made more dynamic and a policy will be embraced wherein central units will be given active responsibilities in policy making, in reducing the levels of decision making in formulating perspective plans and in supervision and monitoring activities. The system of carrying out timely supervision and regular monitoring of programmes conducfed by individual organizations will be developed, the final responsibility for which will lie with the secretaries of miniseries. The concerned secretary will also bear the responsibilities; of co-ordinating the central level programmes to avoid repetition and maintaining inter-ministerial coordination. A system will also be established wherein regular supervisions and follow-ups will be used to identify adverse effects faced by the project due to incorrect technical studies and action will be taken against those responsible. The following policies will be adopted to fulfil the above objectives: 1. Necessary steps will be taken to develop an efficient and dynamic administration by gradually implementing the recommendations of Administrative Reforms Commission and by effecting the necessary restructuring at central, regional and district level administrative organization in order to ma ke the administration more capable and service-oriented. 2. The duties and responsibilities at various levels will be clearly defined and the decision, making process will be streamlined in keeping with HMG\\'s principles of decentralization. Special emphasis will be laid on the delegation of responsibility and authority from the centre to the level of implementation. 3. Necessary changes will be made in the conditions and requirements for postings, transfers, training and work evaluation, in order to enhance performance and to raise the productivity of employees. 4. The works to be carried out by government agencies in the various sectors will be fixed, and accordingly the organizational structure and employee numbers will be determined. 5. Areas of training in many aspects of public administration to be conducted by various agencies will be specified on the basis of objectives, targets and policies. The scope of training to be imparted by training institutes also will be defined, and their proto-types will be made from time to time, to avoid duplication and increase the efficiency of training programmes so as to coordinate all training organizations under a single umbrella as far as possible. As the new management will have to make use of increased scientific technology, the knowledge and skill needed for this will be imparted in the trainings which are to be conducted on a large scale. 6. Undemocratic anomalies in prevailing laws will be corrected and timely reforms introduced to make the civil service democratic and dynamic. The role of the administrative court will be made more effective. 7. The system of classification of services and employees will be reviewed and necessary amendments made. 8. Steps will be taken to make the system of reward and punishment more effective, to relate promotion to performance and ability and to link training to job responsibility and career development. 9. Necessary reforms will be made in the existing financial rules and regulations in order to make efficient use of resources available with development projects. The system of regular monitoring and evaluating development plans and programmes will be institutionalized. Emphasis will be given on improvement of the technical management aspect of the project. 10. In order to make funds readily available at the implementation site, provision will be made to ensure that the authority to spend will automatically be delegated to the concerned office as soon as the budget is passed by parliament. Steps will be taken to reduce irregularities and to make programme budget more effective. To increase revenue collection the revenue administration will undergo various reforms and related training programmes will be extended. In the case of development programmes being affected by the freeze of the released fund at the end of the fiscal year, alternative solution will be explored so that the programme is not affected. 11. Basic facilities will be provided in order to make the Public Service Commission and the Nepal A high level manpower coordination committee comprising the representatives of the ministries of General Administration, Education and Culture, the Public Service Commission and universities will be formed and put into action effectively. 12. The management skill will be raised at local level offices. Special attention will be paid to the quality of services received by the general public. 13. Special measures will be strictly enforced to control corruption. 14. With a view to gradually implementing the recommendations made by the high level Administrative Reform Commission and to make improvements in time an arrangement will be made for monitoring, supervision and evaluation through the high level administrative reform monitoring unit. Science and Technology Science and technology play a very important role in the allround development of the country. The economic development of the nation depends largely on the state of development of science and technology and their proper use. Past experience has made it clear that it will be difficult to increase the pace of development and raise the people\\'s standard of living without utilising appropriate technologies. Efforts seem to have been made in the past to ensure the development of science and technology, but not to the extent warranted by nation. It is only natural that in a predominantly rural nation, the development of the rural sector should play an important role in national development. The kind of science and technology required for expediting the rural upliftment still remains to be developed. In fact, it has become necessary to develop science and technology in a manner that facilitates the development of local skills and technology and allows the mobilisation of available natural resources. The National Science and Technology Council was established in 1975 with the aim of conducting various programmes in the field of science and technology in an organised way, linking it with the national development process. Likewise, the Royal Nepal Academy for Science and Technology was established in 1982 in order to further expedite the development of the science and technology sector. Government and educational institutions, especially Tribhuvan University, have been involved in the development and expansion of science and technology. Research studies are also being carried out in various government research laboratories mostly in the fields of agriculture, botany, mining, and pharmacy. The National Agriculture Research Council has been conducting research on various aspects of agriculture. similarly, the National Herbarium and Botanical Laboratory, Forestry Research Centre, the Royal Drugs Laboratories, The Central Food Research Laboratory and others have also been engaged in the research on technology development. In addition, basic research is also being carried out in the fields of forestry, horticulture, agriculture, engineering and medicine, in the various institutions of Tribhuvan University. The main field of work of the Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology of Tribhuvan University has been the development of science and technology. The centre has undertaken research mainly on various subjects like solar energy, construction materials and natural products. As scientists and tech nicians play a major role in the development of science and technology, efforts are being made to gradually produce such manpower within the country itself. High and mid-level scientific and technological education and training programmes are being conducted to produce technical manpower in Tribhuvan University\\'s various educational units such as the Institute of Engineering, Institute of Forestry, Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, Institute of Medicine and the Institute of Science and Technology . Low level professional manpower is likewise being produced by His Majesty\\'s Government\\'s vocational schools. But the manpower produced by these institutions are grossly inadequate to meet the country\\'s requirements. Moreover, this manpower still needs to be qualitatively standardised. An analysis of the achievements made in this field in the past two or three decades will clearly reveal the obstacles faced by science. and technology. There is an obvious lack of coordination in the activities of the various units that were existing or were created for the development of science and technology. In addition, another major concern has been the inability of scientific and technological development to be geared towards increasing production and productivity. Similarly, the results of research have not been able to be brought into practice in a sizeable scale. There is neither sufficient import of appropriate foreign technology nor is there any attention being paid towards the development of traditional indigenous technologies. Also, the economy has not been able to benefit from the available technology due to the lack of wide dissemination. Against this background, the Eighth Plan objectives and policies with regard to science and technology sector have been laid down. The objectives for the development of science and technology in the Eighth Plan are as follows: (a) To develop science and technology in a way that they could support the all round development of the nation. (b) \\tTo support rural development sectors such as agriculture, cottage and small scale industries by enhancing the scientific and technological capabilities available in the country. (c) \\tTo encourage the import of foreign technologies that have a direct bearing on the country\\'s economic development. Policies The policies that will be adopted to realise the above mentioned objectives are as follows: 1. To promote the use of appropriate technology for the develo pment of economic sectors such as agriculture, industry, power, transport and communications as well as for the rural development. 2. In the context of research works being carried out in various subjects and areas, priority will be given to research works geared soiving the country\\'s problems. Greater attention will be given to adaptive research in the development of cereal crops, horticulture, \\tlivestock as well as rural industries and energy. 3. Emphasis will be laid on scientific research and technological development that assist in the mobilisation of the country\\'s natural resources. Encouragement will also be given to the augmentation of environment and bio-diversity by conducting special research peculiar to Nepal such as snow-hydrology, drought and cold resistant crops, forest trees, etc. 4. The import of appropriate technologies from various developed and developing countries will be beneficial for the speedy development of the country. Hence, the transfer of such technologies will be encouraged thro ugh government, non-governmental. and private sectors. 5. Investment from the private sector is a prerequisite for the adoption and transfer of any technology. As the private sector can expedite the process of technology transfer, these activities will be intensified by involving private agencies. In this context, needed licenses and tariff arrangements will be made to attract foreign investments in viable areas. 6. Appropriate technology development process will be expanded through the promotion of adaptive research with the assistance of the sponsors of technology and capital investors. Arrangements will be made to institutionalise the system of issuing patents and copyright to encourage the private sector in the development and use of technologies in theNepalecse environment. 7. Necessary coordination will be maintained among various government, non-government and private agencies involved in the enhancement of science and technology. A government agency will be instituted to consolidate these different units and to coordinate educational and research work on development of science and technology in an effective manner. 8. Qualitative and quantitative improvements will be made in the production of scientific and technological manpower for the all-round national development. In this context, studies, research and training programmes will be promoted through universities, academies and non-government and private institutions, to develop science and technology in the country. Concrete steps will be taken to give needed authority to such research institutions. 9. The extent to which the accomplishments made in science and technology are availed to various agencies involved in development works is quite limited. Therefore, the achievements made in this field will be widely published and disseminated. This will help to make the general public aware of the benefits and uses of science and technology, and thus help increase their usage. Libraries and information centres will also be mobilised in this task. 10. Specia l attention will be given to the development of traditional indigenous technology. In this regard, the improvement, development and fine tuning of existing technologies in the rural areas will be encouraged. 11. Non-governmental and private institutions will be mobilised to the maximum in technology dissemination and its effective use. 12. In order to lend support to economic development through the utilisation of research results in the science and technology sector, many research establishments have already been set up. Some of these units have not been able to achieve their targets and make desired contribution to the country\\'s development in want of effective leadership and coordination. The work efficiency of such government and private units will be enhanced and the research programmes will be conducted as per the country\\'s needs. Necessary arrangements will be made to mobilise internal resources as well as the external assistance from international organisations and institutions in this endeavour. Programmes In line with the above mentioned objectives and policies, the following programmes will be launched during the Eighth Plan period: 1. \\tmanagement and expansion of the infrastructure necessary to enhance the potentials of scientific research and development. 2. \\tpromotion of the technology transfer and replication. 4. \\tpublicity and dissemination of technology 1. Management and expansion of the infrastructure necessary to enhance the potentials of scientific research and development. While Tribhuvan University, HMGN and other non-government agencies are involved in science and technology development, research and development works are carried out by Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology, Practical Science and Technology Research Centre, Nepal Agriculture Research Council, Institute of Engineering, Institute of Forestry, etc. Research and development works are also being carried out to some extent in the private sector. Arrangements will be made to create a conducive environment for executing the programmes by these institutions. Steps will also be taken for providing research equipment, materials and laboratories necessary for these agencies. The activities that help to increase the capability of the government, non-government and private agencies in developing suitable technology for activities like construction materials production, tunnel construction and other construction works will be carried out. 2. Promotion of Technology Transfer and Replication Technologies helpful in developing agriculture, industry, transport, communication and construction will be identified, and if necessary, permission will be given to import them. The concerned government, private and non-government organizations and institutions will be encouraged to undertake this task. The production of technical manpower required for scientific research and technological development, especially at the high and mid -levels, is insufficient in relation to the demand. To gradually rectify such an imbalance, high and mid-level technical manpower will be produced from the local educational, technical and research institutions. A review of the structure of the available technical manpower indicates that there are discrepancies in the ratio of high, middle and low level technicians in many areas. Hence, while formulating programmes, special attention will be given to minimise such discrepancies. Provision will be made to educate and train the manpower by sending them abroad in subjects which can not be taught locally. 4. Publicity and Dissemination of Science and Technology Science and technologies that have bearings an the social and economic sectors and that directly or indirectly assist development efforts will be extensively disseminated. In order to inculcate interest in science and technology from the lowest level of education relevant educational materials will be included with priority in the school curricula. Public communication media like television, radio, newspapers and the like will also be used to disseminate the effective uses of applied science and technology. Together with this, public and academic libraries will also be used for this purpose. Necessary resources for the above mentioned programmes will be arranged while formulating programmes for the related sectors. Implementation Arrangements Action will be taken to institute a departmental level unit in the government to implement the mentioned objectives, policies and programmes of the science and technology sector. Similarly, several local and foreign institutions at the public and private sector involved in scientific and technological research will be extensively mobilised to get concrete contributions from them. Women in Development Background According to the preliminary result of census of 1991, the population of women in the country was about 9,200,000., that is to say, more than fifty percent of the total population. Nepalese women have been unable to make, the expected contribution in development activities due to illiteracy, poor health, poverty and a traditionally conservative attitude towards them. Financial resources and opportunities like property and income-generating employment are far from the reach of the Nepali womenfolk. In comparison to men, the average life span of Nepali women is 53 years (for men-56 years) , the maternal mortality rate is 850 per 100,000 and the literacy rate for women is 25 percent (whereas for men- it is 55 percent) . As long as women, who constitute more than 50 percent of the total population are not fully involved in the upliftment activities of the nation, the economic development of the country will not be possible. Thus the government is committed to make possible the equal and meaningful participation of women in the development process by improving their economic and social conditions. special provisions have been made in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal - 1991 to make women equal from the legal point of view and to ensure their economic and social development. A national action plan was prepared for the development of Women in accordance with the declaration of the International Year of the women 1975 A.D. For the development of women, this action\\' plan has specified the areas of education, health, employment, agriculture, cooperatives and legal matters (where women can participate) and stated the basic objectives and policy measures for the development of women. Keeping in view the importance of women\\'s participation in national development for the first time in the Sixth Plan, policies to increase the participation of women in national development were laid down. Similarly, the Seventh Plan also adopted national level policy and working policy for women development to increase their participation by raising their social and economic status. In the efforts made for the development of women, certain distinct problems such as the inadequacy of the concerned programme, the lack of institutions for the effective implementation and coordination of areawise policies, and the absence of the analysis of Women\\'s participation in development process have been observed. To make women participate in the main stream of development, to increase their involvement in every sector of development, to improve their social, economic, academic, political and legal status, to provide productive employment opportunities by increasing their efficiency through appropriate knowledge and skills, to create the appropriate environment and infrastructures so that they are provided with the opportunity to play a decisive role from the local to the national level, the following policies are adopted: Policies 1. Special programmes will be conducted to increase the involvement of female students in primary, secondary and adult education. In such programmes, the policy of increasing the admissions of female students; of reducing drop-out before completion; of making it compulsory to appoint a female teacher in a primary school and gradually in the secondary level also in future will be adopted. In the field of adult and informal education, informal and job-oriented education like the \\'chelibeti\\' programme will be conducted. General and technical education will be made available to female students who are unable to acquire higher education or devoid of the opportunity to do SO. A fixed quota will be set aside in order to encourage female students to join higher technical education. Arrangements will be made to allocate a certain percentage of national and international scholarships for girl students and women. 2. In the context of high maternal and infant mortality rates, programmes targeted for women such as safe motherhood, extension of immunization, and services related to family planning which aim to improve the health standards of women, will be carried out. These programmes will be extended to the rural sectors through maternal and child workers and female community women health volunteers. Traditional birth attendants working at the local level will be provided appropriate training and mobilised. Emphasis will be given to the increased participation of women in the development of high level technical manpower in the health sector. Keeping in mind the important contributions made by non governmental agencies in providing health services to rural women, various programmes will be conducted through the active participation of organizations under the social Services National Coordination Council and women\\'s associations. Considering the role of women in controlling population growth, stress will be laid on family planning information, delivery of services and the use of semipermanent devices for birth spacing. Beds will be increased for maternity service in primary health centres district, zonal and regional hospitals. 3. More women farmers will be encouraged to participate in agriculture development programmes such as trainings on improved fertilizers, seeds, and dissemination trainings. The supporting services such as credit market and other facilities necessary for agricultural development will be targeted to women farmers, and arrangements will be made to provide them with the necessary training and physical and financial means. Provision will be made to guarantee trainings and jobs in order to increase mid and high level women agricultural technical work force. 4. Women will also be involved in greater numbers in the field of forest and soil conservation. Women will be encouraged to actively participate in community afforestation programmes in order to solve environmental problems by protecting and developing forest resources. Training and dissemination programmes will be conducted to increase awareness among women about the multiple benefits of proper management of forest resources. Women\\'s participation will also be increased in production and processing of herbs, fodder, etc. 5. As cooperative instit utions can play an important role in the development of rural women, agricultural, cottage and rural industry programmes as well as  cooperative consumer stores and saving programmes will be encouraged through cooperatives. Women participation will be increased in various cooperative trainings. 6. In order to improve the socio-economic status of women by increasing their participation in the industrial sector, provisions will be made to provide such facilities as skill-oriented trainings, raw materials and industrial management training, and easy and subsidized credit. Based on market feasibility and utilisation of local skills, arrangements will be made to establish and manage the market of cottage and rural industries. Such industries will be given a position in the industrial estates. Women\\'s participation will be increased in the implementation and management of industries. Trainings to enhance leadership, management, entrepreneurship and skill development, that increase women\\'s participation in industry, commerce and tourism sectors, will be provided. 7. Emphasis will be laid on the extension of the programmes such as Production Credit for Rural Women Programme and Small Women Farmers\\' Development Programmes in order to improve the economic condition of the rural women. 8. Encouraging provisions will be made in the policy and regulations in order to promote the involvement of the women working in the government and non-government Service sector in the policy making process to a greater extent. The welfare of minorities and backward classes will also be considered. 10. Women development activities which aim to increase awareness, organize public gatherings and mobilise necessary resources for assistance, launched by various women\\' s organizations and other institutions directly involved in the welfare and protection of women will be made effective. 11. Necessary measures will be taken to amend laws and acts that hinder women\\'s development. Legal services and training will be provided to provide legal information to rural women. 12. Women\\'s participation will be encouraged in the formulation and implementation of rural infrastructure programmes in irrigation, drinking water and road construction. For this, women\\'s participation will be made compulsory in users\\' committees. 13. Technologies that help to save time in the collection of firewood, fodder and water and other domestic activities will be extended to the rural sector. 14. In order to promote the meaningful participation of women in development programmes, appropriate organizational structure will be established for coordination and monitoring activities. The Planning Commission will issue guidelines to the ministries for formulating sector-wise programmes for women\\'s development. Child Development Children are the future citizens of the nation and it is the responsibility of the government to create an environment that will be conducive in making them active and capable citizens. According to the population census report of 1981, the population of children under the age of 14 was 6,211,972 whereas the preliminary report of the population census of 1991 indicates that the population of children has reached 7.9 million and constitutes 42.7 percent of the total population. Nepalese children suffer from malnutrition, disease and illiteracy. Because the majority of the rural population remains poor, children have become a part of the labour force in order to contribute to the family income. Together with this, the problems pertaining to the disabled, orphaned, addicted and begging children are equally serious. Though some improvements have been brought about in the fields of child education and health standards by the policy adopted upto the Seventh Plan; the expected results have not been achieved yet. In conducting programmes related to children, problems arise due to the lack of inter-sectoral coordination, reliable institution reliable statistics. Since 1990, there has been a general awakening at the international and national -levels for the protection, and development of children. Nepal is also committed to the resolutions passed by the SAARC Child Conference (1986 A.D.) and the World Child Summit Conference 1990 A.D. for the protection, security and development of children. As per this commitment, the targets upto 2000 A.D. in the various aspects of child development were decided and the National Child Development Action Plan was formulated. Together with this, necessary provision has also been made in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal (1991) to prevent the exploitation of children and to protect their rights and benefits. The integrated child act-1991 has also been passed. The policy adopted in the Eighth Plan for child development is based on the Children and Development Action Plan for the 1990s which was prepared as per the commitment to the World Summit for Children. With the objectives of making the necessary services and facilities available for the physical and mental development of children from the prenatal and nascent stage to their growing up period; preparing patriotic, disciplined, well-principled and capable citizens; cultivating good habits from the very childhood; protecting the rights and benefits of children and enabling parents to rear children by increasing their income level; the following Children and d evelopment policy has been included in the Eighth Plan: 1 Protected maternity programme for the care of children from the womb onwards will be extended to the village level. From the time of conception, periodic health check-ups, treatment and protective maternity services will be made available. 2. To reduce the infant and child mortality rate according to the target of the Eighth Plan, extended programmes will be launched to carry out immunisation and to control gastro-enteritis and respiratory diseases. Together with this, general awareness of child health will be enhanced through the medium of health education. 3. To improve the general and minimum status of nutrition programmes will be implemented maintaining inter-coordination among the food, healthand education sectors. Protein energy and the treatment of diseases related to micro-malnutrition will be made available from sub-health post level The knowledge pertaining to nutritional education will be imparted from the level of primary education onwards. 5. Keeping in mind the advantageous effects of a small family on the development of children, pogramme\\'s that encourage the concept of a small family will be conducted through the medium of family planning services. 6. With the participation of the private sector, non government institutions and local units, child -care centres and pre-primary schools will be established for children in the age group 0-5. 7. Free primary education will be provided to children of primary age. 8. For children of secondary age, secondary education and vocational secondary education opportunities will be made available. 9. Various programmes will be launched according to the needs of children in specially different circumstances employed, blind, disabled, helpless, discarded, orphaned, beggars, as well as children affected by drug abuse, in order to make them able citizens of the country. The child welfare home, orphanage, S.O.S. village etc. and orphan child homes will be developed and expanded. the acts and rules for the labourers will be reformed and arrangeme nts will be made to provide general and vocational education and primary health service facilities in the concerned factories. For the development of children affected by special circumstances, the government will give encouragement and provide facilities to involve national and international non-governmental organisations and institutions. 10. In order to protect the legal rights and benefits of children, the Children Act 1991 has already been published. As the role of non -governmental agencies is important in the effective implementation of laws regarding children, these organisations will be encouraged to disseminate information on laws relating to children and will be motivated to assist., the government in punishing those found violating such laws. 11. Various measures will be adopted to encourage and help the local agencies to fix targets relating to children and development while formulating local level plans, and programmes. 12. A high level National Cnild Development Council will be established to coordinate and monitor the process of implementing the plans. The government and nongovernment units involved in the children and development sector will be represented in the council. The National Planning commission will serve as the secretariat of the council. Non- Governmental Organization Introduction Private and non-governmental organizations play a vital role in national development. Public welfare activities based on the tradition of gaining religious merit and fame, promoting the welfare of others, and assisting the needy are being carried out privately and institutionally in the private sector\\'. As a result, donations from the private sector have contributed considerably to the formation of religious and social trusts. The objectives were to participate in the country\\'s development in order to supplement to government efforts, to arouse general awareness and to empower common people. Subsequently, Paropakar Organisation was established. After Nepal opened its doors to the outside world following the revolution of 1950, the Red cross, Family Planning Association, Lions and Rotary Clubs were established and run by national social worker\\'s and volunteers with the assistance- of international organizations. A wide range of non- governmental organizations concerned with child education, and services relating to fatal diseases like leprosy, tuberculosis and cancer were established through the efforts of social workers, With the increase in the number of such organizations, the insufficiency of government acts, rules, policies and plans to integrate and promote such organisations was felt. The non- governmental organizations also felt the need for a central organisation. At the government level also an organization was felt necessary to promote social welfare and to involve non-governmental organisations in government efforts. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was formed in 1981 with the aim of promoting nongovernmental organisations and social welfare activities through government efforts. At present, nongovernmental institutions have been classified on the basis of their functional nature as follows: These institutions are categorized into national, regional and local levels. Viewed on the regional basis, about 75 percent of these institutions are in the central region. Most of these institutions are required to register simultaneously with the district administration office in accordance with the Organisation Registration Act and Social Services National Coordination Council. Considering the organisations that have only registered with the District Administration Office and are yet to register with the Social Services National Coordination Council, the above mentioned number is very likely to increase. Currently there are 53 international non-governmental organisations working directly or indirectly in Nepal by signing agreements with the Social Services National Coordination Council. of these 36 are working in the central region. Although non -governmental organisations have developed and expanded to such an extent and government and non-governmental organizations have been formed at the central level, these nongovernmental organizations have not been able to become self re liant and to burgeon as expected, neither could the resources of the private sector be diverted to the development process as desired. Some problems have been noticed in this area, they are mainly as follows: 1. There remained a dearth of policies, acts and rules to protect, promote and encourage non-governmental organisations. 2. The Central organisation of the non-governmental organizations and the government mainly exerted greater control and interfered instead of allowing the non-governmental organisation to runindependently. 3. The investment of the private sector could not be attracted towards social and economic development. 4. The administrative procedures were not clear, simple and decentralized. The organizations lacked coordination. 5. Non-govern mental organisations were concentrated in Kathmandu and were not extended throughout the Kingdom as desired. A non-governmental organisation is naturally conceived voluntary by nature; not committed to profit making for distributing dividends among its own members; politically neutral; liberal in conducting programmes; oriented towards the upliftment of the poor, needy and helpless; and active in arousing social awareness. Non-governmental organisations should carry out works, of public importance, involve maximum people\\'s participation and follow democratic practice in selecting the board of directors from among the volunteers. Their policies, programmes and budget must be open and transparent. In view of the limitations of available means and resources, the concrete development of the country is only possible if the vast resources of the private sector are mobilised with effective skills, energy and service, and brought to the mainstream of development to the greatest possible extent through spontaneous mutual organisation of the people. Considering this reality, the Eighth Plan has laid down policies that underline the role and responsibilities of the private and non-governmental organisations. 1. The participation of private and non-government organisations will be expanded in the field of social and economic development as these organisations are more effective from the points of view cost, flexibility, motivation and dynamism in the implementation of development programmes. Policies will be adopted to activate the people through the medium of cooperatives, consumer committees, community development and social organisations and institutions. 2. Administrative processes will be simplified in order to prevent the stagnation of the efforts of the community and non-governmental organizations in social and economic development. Thus, an atmosphere congenial to their self-promotion will be created. 3. In keeping with the liberal policy, non-governmental organisations will be given full autonomy to work in the priority sector as specified by the national plan,. An environment will be created to make the role of non governmental organisations supplementary and complementary in the development efforts of the government and local agencies. The non-governmental organisations will be extended to remote and rural areas from privileged areas. 4. In order to increase the efficiency of national and international non-governmental organisations, they will be encouraged by the government to work in certain specific sectors where they can work more effectively, based on their experience, comparative advantages and efficiency. International non-, governmental organisations will be encouraged to work through Nepalese non-governmental organisations instead of implementing programmes by themselves. 5. As the responsibility of launching most of the social and economic programmes at the local level now fall within the purview of local agencies (district development committees, municipalities and village development committees), the practice of efficiently involving the non-governmental sector will be made to participate actively in social and economic activities with the assistance of, in coordination with and under the guidance of those agencies. It will be guaranteed that the government will not regain control of or interfere in the programmes conducted by the non governmental organisation. 6. A central unit will operate at the central level to assist non- governmental organisations and to act as a contact point between HMG and international agencies. International volunteer organisations will be made to register with this central unit while working in Nepal. A one window system will be adopted and this unit will function as a medium for making available necessary assistance, data and information from the government to the non-governmental organisations. 7. Apart from other development works, social organisations and institutions will be encouraged to focus their activities on empowering the weak and helpless people, classes and communities of the society to lead a life of befitting human standards; on ncreasing the participation of women in development; on developing the appropriate technology, its transfer and use; and on conserving the environment. 8. In areas where the management capacities of nongovernmental organisations located in rural and remote areas are weak, efforts will be made to strengthen the management capacity of such organisations through partnership with international organisations also, along with effective implementation of other social welfare activities. 9. A new system will be set up for effective monitoring and evaluation of the works of the non-governmental organisations. Food and Nutrition The nutritional status of the majority of Nepalese people is low. The main reasons for malnutrition and low nutrition are the scarcity of foodgrains, imbalance in distribution, poverty, illiteracy and the lack of health services. various nutrition related surveys indicate that the majority of Nepalese children are afflicted with, protein-energy malnutrition (P.E.M.). The national nutrition survey of 1975 A.D. estimates that 50 percent of Nepalese children are living under various conditions of malnutrition. Together with this, micro -nutritive problems like Vitamin-A and iodine deficiencies and the condition of anaemia have also assumed serious dimensions. As a result, the poor people, females and children are specially suffering from problems like low height and weight, anaemia, blindness, goitre and dumbness. In accordance with Nepal\\'s commitment to the World Summit for children 1990, a target has been fixed for improving nutritional conditions with regard to children and development by 2000 A.D. The government is equally determined to bring about improvements in the condition of malnutrition among women and the rural population. In this context, the following policies concerned with nutrition have been adopted in the Eighth Plan: 1. As P.E.M. related low nutrition is the major problem in the country, emphasis will be given on food production in the agricultural sector. Concomitantly, the production of nutritive foods such as fish, meat, milk and vegetables will be increased. 2. A supplementary food supply programme will be launched in order to arrange an effective food supply system in the geographically constrained areas and communities badly affected by the scarcity of food and distressing nutritional status. Opportunities to enhance the household food supply will be created by generating means for employment and income in order to improve the malnutrition condition among the poor families, women and children. 3. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to disseminate information about the appropriate baby food prepared at the community and village levels, and also to develop baby food locally. 4. Nutrition education will be included from the primary level education onwards with a view to increase general public awareness with regard to nutritive food, the type of food, the manner in which it is cooked, food storage and changes to be brought about in eating habits. Nutrition education programmes will be integrated with adult literacy, agriculture, and health target projects and conducted accordingly. 5. A programme will be conducted through the sub-health post in which, the measurement of arm, height and weight of children under three years will be checked. The nutrition level of children will be improved by encouraging breast-feeding and introducing supplementary food programmes. A regular weight measurement programme for women, especially pregnant and breast-feeding mothers, will be conducted in order to improve their nutrition level. On the basis of the weight measurement, programmes related to medication, information about nutritious food and the development of kitchen garden will be conducted for women at low nutrition level. 6. Areas with a high prevalence of micro-nutrient deficiencies such as Vitamin-A, iron and iodine will be identified and a programme will be launched to supply such micro-nutrients. 7. The nutrition level of the general public will be taken as an indicator for the evaluation of the effects of development plan on the lives of the people as this has a direct bearing on the socio-economic development of the country. Collection of statistics on nutrition will be institutionalized for the purpose. 8. The National Nutrition coordination Committee will be strengthened and a food and nutrition surveillance unit will be set up to maintain inter-regional coordination for the effective implementation of programmes. Further, the nutrition programmes under the agriculture, health, education and local development sector will be made effective. Monitoring and Evaluation Though a lot of investment had been made in the development projects in the past, an examination of development activities reveals that if, on the one hand, plans were not implemented according to the fixed schedule, on the other, satisfactory results were not obtained from the projects whose implementation was completed. In this context, it is essential to give attention to the economized use of means and resources to increase the preparedness and efficiency in implementing the plan and programme. For this, a mechanism to select the suitable projects, remove obstacles in implementation and complete projects within the stipulated time, is of great importance. This kind of mechanisms can be developed by strengthening the system of regular monitoring and evaluation of various activities of the projects. An analysis of the problems of on-going development projects indicates that most of the projects and programmes are unable to attain their targets because the selection process is not fixed and practical; projects are not completed in time; expenses exceed the allotted amount; loans and assistance funds are underutilized; completed projects are in need of proper repair maintenance and are unable to attain permanence. The institutional arrangement for monitoring and evaluation is very weak. Monitoring and evaluation sect ions/divisions have not been set up in the majority of ministries and departments concerned with development. Under the National Planning commis sion\\'s monitoring procedure, a progress report of the implementation of development projects is submitted every four months and on the basis of this review, implementation is carried out. The problems and obstacles faced during implementation are mentioned in the four monthly progress report but due to the lack of a system of regular monitoring and follow-up the problems are not solved in time. Keeping in mind the above problems, and to realize the targeted benefits from the projects it is necessary to greatly strengthen the current monitoring and evaluation system and make it effective. At the same time, it is equally important to develop definite procedural basis for selection of suitable projects during the selection phase. The information acquired from monitoring and evaluation plays an important role in selection process. These aspects have been kept in view for deciding the objectives, policies and programme of monitoring and evaluation in the Eighth Plan. The objectives of monitoring and evaluation in the Eighth Plan are as follows: 1. To identify and solve problems faced by the projects and complete them within the stipulated time. 2. To complete the projects according to the predetermined programme and cost. 3. To achieve the targeted economic and social benefits from the projects. 4. To update information on the project investments and achievements, and to make such information reliable and easily accessible. The monitoring and evaluation policies are as follows: 1. The monitoring and evaluation system will be provided with political commitment from the highest government executive body and it will be considered as the main strategy in effecting reforms in the development administrative machinery. 2. Institutional reform will be made to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system at the central level. 3. To develop effective monitoring and evaluation network, separate monitoring and evaluation units will be set up in ministries and departments, and these will be strongly linked with the central unit of monitoring and evaluation system. 4. An appropriate work procedure will be formulated to solve the problems faced in the implementation of the projects. 5. Monitoring and evaluation will be used to assess the work-efficiency and career developme nt of the government employees. 6. Separate service cadre will be created for the personnel working in planning, monitoring and evaluation as knowledge of planning, management, implementation, and data collection and analysis is essential for monitoring and evaluation works. 7. In order to make the project implementation more people-oriented and objective-oriented, political institutions and consumer groups will be made to participate in the monitoring and evaluation of projects at various levels. 8. Universities and other academic institutions will also be involved as required in carrying out on-going, midterm and final evaluations of projects and programmes to expedite implementation of the projects, to carry out impartial evaluation of programmes already implemented, to develop the concept for new projects and to draw lessons from the projects under implementation. Programmes 1. The National Development Action Committee will be formed under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister to coordinate inter-ministerial activities and to solve problems that require high level action. The concerned minister, the finance minister, general administration minister, the Vice-Chairman of the National Planning commission, the concerned members and the member concerning the monitoring and evaluation in the National Planning Commission and the chief secretary will be the members of this committee. The committee will meet regularly once in every four months. 2. The central monitoring and evaluation division of the National Planning Commission will be the central unit for the institutional development and operation of the monitoring and evaluation system. Appropriate skilled manpower and computer and other facilities will be made available at this division. 3. \\ton the basis of work load and number of types of projects, separate monitoring and evaluation division or separate monitoring and evaluation section in the Planning Divisions of the ministry will be formed as required in every ministry. 4. A separate service cadre related to economic planning, monitoring and evaluation will be formed to develop skilled manpower for monitoring and evaluation system. Under this cadre national and sectoral planning service sub-groups will be created and statistical service sub-group will also be merged with this cadre. Arrangements for professional development (promotion etc.) will be made under this cadre. 5. Suitable training institutions, among those functioning in the country will be strengthened for the provision of efficient training. 6. To provide continuity to the process of monitoring and evaluation and to solve the problems that arise in the process of operation and implementation of the projects, following steps will be taken: (a) Apart from the previously mentioned National Development Action Committee, a Ministerial Level Development Action Committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of the concerned minister. In this committee, the concerned secretary, the representatives of the finance ministry, general administration ministry, National Planning Commission, the concerned departmental chief and chiefs of the planning and the monitoring divisions of the ministry will be the members. (b) \\tReporting will be regularised by developing monitoring and evaluation reporting formats and appropriate indicators according to the nature of the projects. (c) \\tImpartial on-going, mid -term and impact evaluations of the projects will be done according to the needs. universities and academic institutions will also be involved in this task. (d) \\tThe monitoring and evaluation data will gradually be computerized and standardised after carrying out appropriate analysis. Audiovisual equipment will be utilised to make this system effective and efficient. (e) \\tAppropriate rules and regulations will be formulated to make provision for necessary administrative authority to enable the central monitoring and evaluation system to play effective and authoritative role. (f) \\tThe concepts of management by result and norms based on performance will be developed and utilized in every department in order to encourage the use of monitoring and evaluation process in career development, and reward and punishment of employees so as to increase their work efficiency. It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag; it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect. David said to him, \"Where do you come from?\" He said to him, \"I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.\" David said to him, \"How did it go? Please tell me.\" He answered, \"The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.\" David said to the young man who told him, \"How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?\" The young man who told him said, \"As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, \\'Here I am.\\' He said to me, \\'Who are you?\\' I answered him, \\'I am an Amalekite.\\' He said to me, \\'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.\\' So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.\" Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him. They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. David said to the young man who told him, \"Where are you from?\" He answered, \"I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.\" David said to him, \"How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh\\'s anointed?\" David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son (and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar): \"Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen! Don\\'t tell it in Gath. Don\\'t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan\\'s bow didn\\'t turn back. Saul\\'s sword didn\\'t return empty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions. You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!\" It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, \"Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?\" Yahweh said to him, \"Go up.\" David said, \"Where shall I go up?\" He said, \"To Hebron.\" So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron. The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, \"The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.\" David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, \"Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him. Now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing. Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.\" Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul\\'s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. Ishbosheth, Saul\\'s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. Abner said to Joab, \"Please let the young men arise and play before us!\" Joab said, \"Let them arise!\" Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow\\'s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle. Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn\\'t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. Then Abner looked behind him, and said, \"Is it you, Asahel?\" He answered, \"It is I.\" Abner said to him, \"Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.\" But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. Abner said again to Asahel, \"Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?\" However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. It happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. Then Abner called to Joab, and said, \"Shall the sword devour forever? Don\\'t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?\" Joab said, \"As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother.\" So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David\\'s servants nineteen men and Asahel. But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner\\'s men, so that three hundred sixty men died. They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron. Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David\\'s wife. These were born to David in Hebron. It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul. Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, \"Why have you gone in to my father\\'s concubine?\" Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, \"Am I a dog\\'s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman! He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him. Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, \"Whose is the land?\" and saying, \"Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Israel around to you.\" He said, \"Good; I will make a treaty with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul\\'s daughter, when you come to see my face.\" David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul\\'s son, saying, \"Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.\" Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, \"Go! Return!\" and he returned. Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, \"In times past, you sought for David to be king over you. Now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, \\'By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.\\'\" Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast. Abner said to David, \"I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.\" David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace. Then Joab came to the king, and said, \"What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone? You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.\" When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn\\'t know it. When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. Afterward, when David heard it, he said, \"I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father\\'s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.\" So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. The king lamented for Abner, and said, \"Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.\" All the people wept again over him. All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, \"God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.\" All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people. So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner. The king said to his servants, \"Don\\'t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.\" When Saul\\'s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. Saul\\'s son had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin: and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day). Now Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon. They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, \"Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.\" David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, \"As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity, when someone told me, \\'Behold, Saul is dead,\\' thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?\" David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron. Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, \"Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh said to you, \\'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.\\'\" So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, \"Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here\"; thinking, \"David can\\'t come in here.\" Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. David said on that day, \"Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David\\'s soul.\" Therefore they say, \"The blind and the lame can\\'t come into the house.\" David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward. David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him. Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel\\'s sake. David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet. When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold. Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. David inquired of Yahweh, saying, \"Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?\" Yahweh said to David, \"Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.\" David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, \"Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.\" Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim. They left their images there; and David and his men took them away. The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, \"You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them over against the mulberry trees. It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.\" David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer. David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim. They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals. When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled. The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day. David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, \"How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me?\" So David would not move the ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house. It was told king David, saying, \"Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God.\" David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy. It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart. They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh. When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies. He gave to all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house. Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, \"How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!\" David said to Michal, \"It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh. I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me.\" Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death. It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, \"See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.\" Nathan said to the king, \"Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.\" It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying, \"Go and tell my servant David, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in? For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle. In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, \\'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?\\'\"\\' Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, \\'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, \"I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel. I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.\"\\'\" According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, \"Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant\\'s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord Yahweh! What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh. For your word\\'s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it. Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods? You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God. Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken. Let your name be magnified forever, saying, \\'Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.\\' For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, \\'I will build you a house.\\' Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you. \"Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.\" After this it happened that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River. David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots. When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer, then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued; of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people. Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David\\'s sons were chief ministers. David said, \"Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan\\'s sake?\" There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, \"Are you Ziba?\" He said, \"Your servant is he.\" The king said, \"Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?\" Ziba said to the king, \"Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.\" The king said to him, \"Where is he?\" Ziba said to the king, \"Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.\" Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar. Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, \"Mephibosheth.\" He answered, \"Behold, your servant!\" David said to him, \"Don\\'t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father\\'s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually.\" He bowed down, and said, \"What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?\" You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master\\'s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master\\'s son shall eat bread always at my table.\" Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. Then Ziba said to the king, \"According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do.\" So Mephibosheth ate at the king\\'s table, like one of the king\\'s sons. Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king\\'s table. He was lame in both his feet. It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place. David said, \"I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.\" So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David\\'s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, \"Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn\\'t David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?\" So Hanun took David\\'s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, \"Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.\" When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men. The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. He said, \"If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him.\" So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head. It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there. When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more. It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king\\'s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on. David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, \"Isn\\'t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\" David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house. The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, \"I am with child.\" David sent to Joab, \"Send me Uriah the Hittite.\" Joab sent Uriah to David. When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. David said to Uriah, \"Go down to your house, and wash your feet.\" Uriah departed out of the king\\'s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him. But Uriah slept at the door of the king\\'s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn\\'t go down to his house. When they had told David, saying, \"Uriah didn\\'t go down to his house,\" David said to Uriah, \"Haven\\'t you come from a journey? Why didn\\'t you go down to your house?\" Uriah said to David, \"The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!\" David said to Uriah, \"Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.\" So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day. When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn\\'t go down to his house. It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. He wrote in the letter, saying, \"Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.\" It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were. The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; and he commanded the messenger, saying, \"When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king, it shall be that, if the king\\'s wrath arise, and he asks you, \\'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn\\'t you know that they would shoot from the wall? who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn\\'t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?\\' then you shall say, \\'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\\'\" So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for. The messenger said to David, \"The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate. The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king\\'s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\" Then David said to the messenger, \"Thus you shall tell Joab, \\'Don\\'t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.\\' Encourage him.\" When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh. Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, \"There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter. A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man\\'s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him.\" David\\'s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, \"As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die! He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!\" Nathan said to David, \"You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: \\'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. I gave you your master\\'s house, and your master\\'s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things. Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.\\' \"This is what Yahweh says: \\'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\\'\" David said to Nathan, \"I have sinned against Yahweh.\" Nathan said to David, \"Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die. However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh\\'s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.\" Nathan departed to his house. Yahweh struck the child that Uriah\\'s wife bore to David, and it was very sick. David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth. The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. It happened on the seventh day, that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, \"Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn\\'t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?\" But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, \"Is the child dead?\" They said, \"He is dead.\" Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate. Then his servants said to him, \"What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.\" He said, \"While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, \\'Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?\\' But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.\" David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him; and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh\\'s sake. Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. Joab sent messengers to David, and said, \"I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters. Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.\" David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David\\'s head. He brought out the spoil of the city, exceeding much. He brought out the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\\'s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. He said to him, \"Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won\\'t you tell me?\" Amnon said to him, \"I love Tamar, my brother Absalom\\'s sister.\" Jonadab said to him, \"Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, \\'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.\\'\" So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, \"Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.\" Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, \"Go now to your brother Amnon\\'s house, and prepare food for him.\" So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\\'s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, \"Have all men leave me.\" Every man went out from him. Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.\" Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother. When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, \"Come, lie with me, my sister!\" She answered him, \"No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don\\'t you do this folly. I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.\" However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her. Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, \"Arise, be gone!\" She said to him, \"Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!\" But he would not listen to her. Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, \"Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.\" She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king\\'s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went. Absalom her brother said to her, \"Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don\\'t take this thing to heart.\" So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom\\'s house. But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry. Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king\\'s sons. Absalom came to the king, and said, \"See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.\" The king said to Absalom, \"No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.\" He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him. Then Absalom said, \"If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.\" The king said to him, \"Why should he go with you?\" But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king\\'s sons go with him. Absalom commanded his servants, saying, \"Mark now, when Amnon\\'s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, \\'Strike Amnon,\\' then kill him. Don\\'t be afraid. Haven\\'t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!\" The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king\\'s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled. It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, \"Absalom has slain all the king\\'s sons, and there is not one of them left!\" Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\\'s brother, answered, \"Don\\'t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king\\'s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. Now therefore don\\'t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king\\'s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.\" But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him. Jonadab said to the king, \"Behold, the king\\'s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.\" It happened, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king\\'s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly. But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day. So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king\\'s heart was toward Absalom. Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, \"Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don\\'t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead. Go in to the king, and speak like this to him.\" So Joab put the words in her mouth. When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, \"Help, O king!\" The king said to her, \"What ails you?\" She answered, \"Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. Your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him. Behold, the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, \\'Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.\\' Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.\" The king said to the woman, \"Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.\" The woman of Tekoa said to the king, \"My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father\\'s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.\" The king said, \"Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.\" Then she said, \"Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.\" He said, \"As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth.\" Then the woman said, \"Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.\" He said, \"Say on.\" The woman said, \"Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one. For we must die, and are as water split on the ground, which can\\'t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him. Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, \\'I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.\\' For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. Then your handmaid said, \\'Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God, be with you.\\'\" Then the king answered the woman, \"Please don\\'t hide anything from me that I ask you.\" The woman said, \"Let my lord the king now speak.\" The king said, \"Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?\" The woman answered, \"As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid; to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.\" The king said to Joab, \"Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.\" Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, \"Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.\" So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. The king said, \"Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.\" So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn\\'t see the king\\'s face. Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year\\'s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king\\'s weight. To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face. Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn\\'t see the king\\'s face. Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. Therefore he said to his servants, \"Behold, Joab\\'s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.\" Absalom\\'s servants set the field on fire. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, \"Why have your servants set my field on fire?\" Absalom answered Joab, \"Behold, I sent to you, saying, \\'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, \"Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king\\'s face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.\"\\'\" So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, \"What city are you from?\" He said, \"Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.\" Absalom said to him, \"Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.\" Absalom said moreover, \"Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!\" It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, \"Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron. For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, \\'If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.\\'\" The king said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So he arose, and went to Hebron. But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, \"As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, \\'Absalom is king in Hebron!\\'\" Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn\\'t know anything. Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David\\'s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. A messenger came to David, saying, \"The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.\" David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, \"Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.\" The king\\'s servants said to the king, \"Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.\" The king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house. The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak. All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \"Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place. Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.\" Ittai answered the king, and said, \"As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall is, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.\" David said to Ittai, \"Go and pass over.\" Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him. All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city. The king said to Zadok, \"Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation; but if he say thus, \\'I have no delight in you;\\' behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him.\" The king said also to Zadok the priest, \"Aren\\'t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.\" Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they stayed there. David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. Someone told David, saying, \"Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\" David said, \"Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\" It happened that when David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head. David said to him, \"If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me; but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, \\'I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father\\'s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.\\' Don\\'t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king\\'s house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok\\'s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar\\'s son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.\" So Hushai, David\\'s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem. When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king\\'s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink. The king said, \"Where is your master\\'s son?\" Ziba said to the king, \"Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, \\'Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.\\'\" Then the king said to Ziba, \"Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours.\" Ziba said, \"I do obeisance. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.\" When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came. He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. Shimei said when he cursed, \"Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow! Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!\" Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.\" The king said, \"What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, \\'Curse David;\\' who then shall say, \\'Why have you done so?\\'\" David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, \"Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him. It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.\" So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust. The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David\\'s friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\" Absalom said to Hushai, \"Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn\\'t you go with your friend?\" Hushai said to Absalom, \"No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay. Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn\\'t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father\\'s presence, so will I be in your presence.\" Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, \"Give your counsel what we shall do.\" Ahithophel said to Absalom, \"Go in to your father\\'s concubines, that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.\" So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father\\'s concubines in the sight of all Israel. The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, \"Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight. I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him shall flee. I will strike the king only; and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.\" The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. Then Absalom said, \"Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.\" When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, \"Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.\" Hushai said to Absalom, \"The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.\" Hushai said moreover, \"You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, \\'There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!\\' Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men. But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person. So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one. Moreover, if he be gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn\\'t one small stone found there.\" Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \"The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.\" For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom. Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, \"Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way. Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, \\'Don\\'t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.\\'\" Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city. But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there. The woman took and spread the covering over the well\\'s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known. Absalom\\'s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" The woman said to them, \"They have gone over the brook of water.\" When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, \"Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.\" Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan. When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father. Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab\\'s mother. Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead. It happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab\\'s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, \"I will surely go forth with you myself also.\" But the people said, \"You shall not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.\" The king said to them, \"I will do what seems best to you.\" The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, \"Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.\" All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom. So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on. A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, \"Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.\" Joab said to the man who told him, \"Behold, you saw it, and why didn\\'t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.\" The man said to Joab, \"Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn\\'t put forth my hand against the king\\'s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, \\'Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.\\' Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.\" Then Joab said, \"I\\'m not going to wait like this with you.\" He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. Ten young men who bore Joab\\'s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him. Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people. They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent. Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king\\'s dale; for he said, \"I have no son to keep my name in memory.\" He called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom\\'s monument, to this day. Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, \"Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.\" Joab said to him, \"You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king\\'s son is dead.\" Then Joab said to the Cushite, \"Go, tell the king what you have seen!\" The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran. Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, \"But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.\" Joab said, \"Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?\" \"But come what may,\" he said, \"I will run.\" He said to him, \"Run!\" Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite. Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone. The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, \"If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.\" He came closer and closer. The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, \"Behold, a man running alone!\" The king said, \"He also brings news.\" The watchman said, \"I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.\" The king said, \"He is a good man, and comes with good news.\" Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, \"All is well.\" He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, \"Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!\" The king said, \"Is it well with the young man Absalom?\" Ahimaaz answered, \"When Joab sent the king\\'s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don\\'t know what it was.\" The king said, \"Turn aside, and stand here.\" He turned aside, and stood still. Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, \"News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.\" The king said to the Cushite, \"Is it well with the young man Absalom?\" The Cushite answered, \"May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.\" The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, \"My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!\" It was told Joab, \"Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.\" The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, \"The king grieves for his son.\" The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, \"My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!\" Joab came into the house to the king, and said, \"You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines; in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well. Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don\\'t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.\" Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, \"Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.\" All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, \"The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don\\'t you speak a word of bringing the king back?\" King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, \"Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, \\'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house. You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?\\' Say to Amasa, \\'Aren\\'t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren\\'t captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.\\'\" He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, \"Return, you and all your servants.\" So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king. A ferry boat went to bring over the king\\'s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan. He said to the king, \"Don\\'t let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.\" But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, \"Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh\\'s anointed?\" David said, \"What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For don\\'t I know that I am this day king over Israel?\" The king said to Shimei, \"You shall not die.\" The king swore to him. Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. It happened, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, \"Why didn\\'t you go with me, Mephibosheth?\" He answered, \"My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame. He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes. For all my father\\'s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?\" The king said to him, \"Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.\" Mephibosheth said to the king, \"Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.\" Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan. Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. The king said to Barzillai, \"Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.\" Barzillai said to the king, \"How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king? Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward? Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.\" The king answered, \"Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you.\" All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place. So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, \"Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David\\'s men with him?\" All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, \"Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king\\'s cost? Or has he given us any gift?\" The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, \"We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?\" The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, \"We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!\" So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem. David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn\\'t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood. Then the king said to Amasa, \"Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.\" So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him. David said to Abishai, \"Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord\\'s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.\" There went out after him Joab\\'s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out. Joab said to Amasa, \"Is it well with you, my brother?\" Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab\\'s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn\\'t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. There stood by him one of Joab\\'s young men, and said, \"He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!\" Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still. When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. Then a wise woman cried out of the city, \"Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, \\'Come near here, that I may speak with you.\\'\" He came near to her; and the woman said, \"Are you Joab?\" He answered, \"I am.\" Then she said to him, \"Hear the words of your handmaid.\" He answered, \"I do hear.\" Then she spoke, saying, \"They were used to say in old times, \\'They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;\\' and so they settled it. I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?\" Joab answered, \"Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.\" The woman said to Joab, \"Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.\" Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, \"It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.\" The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah); and David said to the Gibeonites, \"What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?\" The Gibeonites said to him, \"It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.\" He said, \"Whatever you say, that will I do for you.\" They said to the king, \"The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.\" The king said, \"I will give them.\" But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh\\'s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest. Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night. It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa; and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged. They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that God was entreated for the land. The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint; and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought to have slain David. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, \"You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you don\\'t quench the lamp of Israel.\" It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite\\'s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver\\'s beam. There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David\\'s brother, killed him. These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: and he said, \"Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence. I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies. For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me. In my distress I called on Yahweh. Yes, I called to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry came into his ears. Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry. Smoke went up out of his nostrils. Fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet. He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind. He made darkness pavilions around himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies. At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled. Yahweh thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered his voice. He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them. Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils. He sent from on high and he took me. He drew me out of many waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support. He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me. Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands. For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his ordinances were before me. As for his statutes, I did not depart from them. I was also perfect toward him. I kept myself from my iniquity. Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect. With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down. For you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh will light up my darkness. For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall. As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. For who is God, besides Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God? God is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect. He makes his feet like hinds\\' feet, and sets me on my high places. He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass. You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great. You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped. I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn\\'t turn again until they were consumed. I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can\\'t arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet. For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me. They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn\\'t answer them. Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad. You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me. The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me. The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places. Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation, even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me, who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man. Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. Will sing praises to your name. He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.\" Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse says, the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel: \"The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me. His word was on my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, \\'One who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God, shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, when the tender grass springs out of the earth, through clear shining after rain.\\' Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he doesn\\'t make it grow. But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they can\\'t be taken with the hand, But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.\" These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time. After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away. He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil. After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory. Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. David longed, and said, \"Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!\" The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh. He said, \"Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn\\'t it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?\" Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. Wasn\\'t he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn\\'t attain to the three. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian\\'s hand, and killed him with his own spear. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men. He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn\\'t attain to the three. David set him over his guard. Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash. Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah, Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, \"Go, number Israel and Judah.\" The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, \"Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the sum of the people.\" Joab said to the king, \"Now may Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?\" Notwithstanding, the king\\'s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer: then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon, and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba. So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. David\\'s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, \"I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.\" When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David\\'s seer, saying, \"Go and speak to David, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.\"\\'\" So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, \"Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days\\' pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.\" David said to Gad, \"I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.\" So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, \"It is enough. Now stay your hand.\" The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, \"Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father\\'s house.\" Gad came that day to David, and said to him, \"Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\" David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded. Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. Araunah said, \"Why has my lord the king come to his servant?\" David said, \"To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.\" Araunah said to David, \"Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood: all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.\" Araunah said to the king, \"May Yahweh your God accept you.\" The king said to Araunah, \"No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.\" So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn\\'t keep warm. Therefore his servants said to him, \"Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.\" So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn\\'t know her intimately. He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him. But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king\\'s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king\\'s servants: but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he didn\\'t call. Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, \"Haven\\'t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn\\'t know it? Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon. Go in to king David, and tell him, \\'Didn\\'t you, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?\\' Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.\" Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king. Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, \"What would you like?\" She said to him, \"My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid, \\'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.\\' Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don\\'t know it. He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn\\'t called Solomon your servant. You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.\" Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. They told the king, saying, \"Behold, Nathan the prophet!\" When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. Nathan said, \"My lord, king, have you said, \\'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?\\' For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king\\'s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, \\'Long live king Adonijah!\\' But he hasn\\'t called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon. Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven\\'t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\" Then king David answered, \"Call to me Bathsheba.\" She came into the king\\'s presence, and stood before the king. The king swore, and said, \"As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity, most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, \\'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;\\' most certainly so will I do this day.\" Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, \"Let my lord king David live forever!\" King David said, \"Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.\" They came before the king. The king said to them, \"Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, \\'Long live king Solomon!\\' Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.\" Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, \"Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so. As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.\" So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David\\'s mule, and brought him to Gihon. Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, \"Long live king Solomon!\" All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound. Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, \"Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?\" While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, \"Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.\" Jonathan answered Adonijah, \"Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king. The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king\\'s mule. Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard. Also thus said the king, \\'Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.\\'\" All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way. Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. It was told Solomon, saying, \"Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, \\'Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.\\'\" Solomon said, \"If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.\" So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, \"Go to your house.\" Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying, \"I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man; and keep the instruction of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself. That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, \\'If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,\\' he said, \\'a man on the throne of Israel.\\' \"Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his shoes that were on his feet. Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don\\'t let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother. \"Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, \\'I will not put you to death with the sword.\\' Now therefore don\\'t hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.\" David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, \"Do you come peaceably?\" He said, \"Peaceably. He said moreover, I have something to tell you.\" She said, \"Say on.\" He said, \"You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother\\'s; for it was his from Yahweh. Now I ask one petition of you. Don\\'t deny me.\" She said to him, \"Say on.\" He said, \"Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you \\'no\\'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.\" Bathsheba said, \"Alright. I will speak for you to the king.\" Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king\\'s mother; and she sat on his right hand. Then she said, \"I ask one small petition of you; don\\'t deny me.\" The king said to her, \"Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.\" She said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.\" King Solomon answered his mother, \"Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.\" Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, \"God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life. Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\" King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died. To Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.\" So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn\\'t turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. It was told king Solomon, \"Joab has fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the altar.\" Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, \"Go, fall on him.\" Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, \"Thus says the king, \\'Come forth!\\'\" He said, \"No; but I will die here.\" Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, \"Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.\" The king said to him, \"Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father\\'s house. Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn\\'t know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah. So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from Yahweh.\" Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar. The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don\\'t go out from there anywhere. For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.\" Shimei said to the king, \"The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.\" Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, \"Behold, your servants are in Gath.\" Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again. The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, \"Didn\\'t I adjure you by Yahweh, and warn you, saying, \\'Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die?\\' You said to me, \\'The saying that I have heard is good.\\' Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?\" The king said moreover to Shimei, \"You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father. Therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head. But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh forever.\" So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh\\'s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem all around. Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days. Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, \"Ask what I shall give you.\" Solomon said, \"You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am but a little child. I don\\'t know how to go out or come in. Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can\\'t be numbered nor counted for multitude. Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?\" The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. God said to him, \"Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice; behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you. I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days. If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.\" Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him. The one woman said, \"Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house. It happened the third day after I delivered, that this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house. This woman\\'s child died in the night, because she lay on it. She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.\" The other woman said, \"No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.\" This said, \"No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son.\" Thus they spoke before the king. Then the king said, \"The one says, \\'This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;\\' and the other says, \\'No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.\\'\" The king said, \"Get me a sword.\" They brought a sword before the king. The king said, \"Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.\" Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, \"Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it!\" But the other said, \"It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it.\" Then the king answered, \"Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She is its mother.\" All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice. King Solomon was king over all Israel. These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king\\'s friend; and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor. Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh, and all the land of Hepher); Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife); Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him belonged the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars); Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife); Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land. Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life. For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him. Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon\\'s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his duty. God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore. Solomon\\'s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around. He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were one thousand five. He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish. There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, \"You know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet. But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, \\'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for my name.\\' Now therefore command that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon. My servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you shall say. For you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.\" It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, \"Blessed is Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.\" Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, \"I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them. You shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.\" So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire. Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a treaty together. King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor. Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains; besides Solomon\\'s chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work. The king commanded, and they cut out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone. Solomon\\'s builders and Hiram\\'s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house. It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon\\'s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Yahweh. The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits. The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house. For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work. Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around. The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house. The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third. So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying, \"Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.\" So Solomon built the house, and finished it. He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir. He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place. In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits. There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Within the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar. So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold. In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high. He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. He overlaid the cherubim with gold. He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside. The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside. For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall. So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees. So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall; and two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. He carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work. He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams. In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month Ziv. In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it. Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars. It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row. There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks. All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks. He made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them. He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh\\'s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch. All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court. The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood. The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house. King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work. For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about. He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital. The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits. There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital. He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz. On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it. Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast. It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. It was a handbreadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths. He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height. The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges; and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each. The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round. The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten. There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself. In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same. On the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. In this way, he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin. He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers\\' households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion. All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these the priests and the Levites brought up. King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day. There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh. Then Solomon said, \"Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.\" The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood. He said, \"Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying, \\'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.\\' \"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. But Yahweh said to David my father, \\'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.\\' Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.\" Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; and he said, \"Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart; who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day. Now therefore, may Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, \\'There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.\\' \"Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father. But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can\\'t contain you; how much less this house that I have built! Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day; that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, \\'My name shall be there;\\' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place. Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive. \"If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swear before your altar in this house; then hear in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. \"When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house: then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers. \"When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them: then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance. \"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is; whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;) that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers. hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name. \"If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name; then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn\\'t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, \\'We have sinned, and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly;\\' if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name: then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause; and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them (for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron); that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you. For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.\" It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, \"Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant. May Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us, nor forsake us; that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require; that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God. There is none else. \"Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.\" The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh. Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh. The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings. So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people. It happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh, and the king\\'s house, and all Solomon\\'s desire which he was pleased to do, that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. Yahweh said to him, \"I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me. I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances; then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David your father, saying, \\'There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.\\' But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, \\'Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?\\' It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king\\'s house (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn\\'t please him. He said, \"What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?\" He called them the land of Cabul to this day. Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold. This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon\\'s wife. Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower, and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day. But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. These were the chief officers who were over Solomon\\'s work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work. But Pharaoh\\'s daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then he built Millo. Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh three times a year, burning incense with them, on the altar that was before Yahweh. So he finished the house. King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom. Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon. When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh, she came to prove him with hard questions. She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart. Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn\\'t tell her. When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her. She said to the king, \"It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom. However I didn\\'t believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it. Behold, the half was not told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom. Blessed is Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel. Because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.\" She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones. The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king\\'s house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day. King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold, besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country. King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler. he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays. Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom. All king Solomon\\'s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king\\'s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price. A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means. Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites; of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, \"You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.\" Solomon joined to these in love. He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn\\'t go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. So he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods. Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn\\'t keep that which Yahweh commanded. Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, \"Because this is done by you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant. Notwithstanding I will not do it in your days, for David your father\\'s sake; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant\\'s sake, and for Jerusalem\\'s sake which I have chosen.\" Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king\\'s seed in Edom. For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom); that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father\\'s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child. They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land. Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh\\'s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh\\'s house among the sons of Pharaoh. When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, \"Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.\" Then Pharaoh said to him, \"But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?\" He answered, \"Nothing, however only let me depart.\" God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus. He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother\\'s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father. The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph. It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces. He said to Jeroboam, \"Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, \\'Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David\\'s sake and for Jerusalem\\'s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did. \"\\'However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant\\'s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes; but I will take the kingdom out of his son\\'s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes. To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel. It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.\\'\" Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren\\'t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon? The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt, and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, \"Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.\" He said to them, \"Depart for three days, then come back to me.\" The people departed. King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, \"What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?\" They spoke to him, saying, \"If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.\" But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. He said to them, \"What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, \\'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?\\'\" The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, \"Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you, saying, \\'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us;\\' you shall say to them, \\'My little finger is thicker than my father\\'s waist. Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\\'\" So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, \"Come to me again the third day.\" The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, \"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\" So the king didn\\'t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. When all Israel saw that the king didn\\'t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, \"What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.\" So Israel departed to their tents. But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day. It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, \"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Everyone return to his house; for this thing is of me.\"\\'\" So they listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh. Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there, and built Penuel. Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, \"It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!\" He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. This thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan. He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi. Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense. Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said, \"Altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: \\'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name. On you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and they will burn men\\'s bones on you.\\'\" He gave a sign the same day, saying, \"This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.\" It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, \"Seize him!\" His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to himself. The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh. The king answered the man of God, \"Now entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.\" The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king\\'s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. The king said to the man of God, \"Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.\" The man of God said to the king, \"Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place; for so was it commanded me by the word of Yahweh, saying, \\'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that you came.\\'\" So he went another way, and didn\\'t return by the way that he came to Bethel. Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. Their father said to them, \"Which way did he go?\" Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah. He said to his sons, \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it. He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, \"Are you the man of God who came from Judah?\" He said, \"I am.\" Then he said to him, \"Come home with me, and eat bread.\" He said, \"I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. For it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, \\'You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.\\'\" He said to him, \"I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, \\'Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.\\'\" He lied to him. So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water. It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back; and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you, but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, \"Eat no bread, and drink no water\"; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.\\'\" It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. When he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him. His body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body. Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived. When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, \"It is the man of God who was disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion, which has mauled him and slain him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.\" He spoke to his sons, saying, \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" They saddled it. He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey. The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him. He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, \"Alas, my brother!\" It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, \"When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones. For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely happen.\" After this thing Jeroboam didn\\'t return from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places. This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth. At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. Jeroboam said to his wife, \"Please get up and disguise yourself, that you won\\'t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people. Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.\" Jeroboam\\'s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. Yahweh said to Ahijah, \"Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall tell her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.\" It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, \"Come in, you wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news. Go, tell Jeroboam, \\'Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: \"Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel, and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes, but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back: therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone. He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.\"\\' Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child shall die. All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is day! What? Even now. For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger. He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.\" Jeroboam\\'s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet. The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place. Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother\\'s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree; and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel. It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king\\'s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king\\'s house. It was so, that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room. Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother\\'s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place. Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah. He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father. Nevertheless for David\\'s sake, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem; because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn\\'t turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his place. In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did David his father. He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days. He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king\\'s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, \"There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\" Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah. Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin. Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place. It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he didn\\'t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite; for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger. Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin. The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, \"Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. The dogs will eat Baasha\\'s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat.\" Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place. Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him. In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years. His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah: and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha: he didn\\'t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall, neither of his relatives, nor of his friends. Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities. Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king\\'s house, and burnt the king\\'s house over him with fire, and died, for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah. He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria. Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him. For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities. Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place. In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him. It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun. Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, \"As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.\" The word of Yahweh came to him, saying, \"Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.\" So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land. The word of Yahweh came to him, saying, \"Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.\" So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, \"Please get me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\" As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, \"Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.\" She said, \"As Yahweh your God lives, I don\\'t have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar. Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\" Elijah said to her, \"Don\\'t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son. For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, \\'The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.\\'\" She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate many days. The jar of meal didn\\'t empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah. It happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him. She said to Elijah, \"What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!\" He said to her, \"Give me your son.\" He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed. He cried to Yahweh, and said, \"Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I stay, by killing her son?\" He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, \"Yahweh my God, please let this child\\'s soul come into him again.\" Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, \"Behold, your son lives.\" The woman said to Elijah, \"Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.\" It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, \"Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.\" Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly: for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) Ahab said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.\" So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, \"Is it you, my lord Elijah?\" He answered him, \"It is I. Go, tell your lord, \\'Behold, Elijah is here!\\'\" He said, \"Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, \\'He is not here,\\' he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn\\'t find you. Now you say, \\'Go, tell your lord, \"Behold, Elijah is here.\"\\' It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don\\'t know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can\\'t find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared Yahweh from my youth. Wasn\\'t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh\\'s prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? Now you say, \\'Go, tell your lord, \"Behold, Elijah is here\";\\' and he will kill me.\" Elijah said, \"As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\" So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" He answered, \"I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father\\'s house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals. Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel\\'s table.\" So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel. Elijah came near to all the people, and said, \"How long will you waver between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\" The people answered him not a word. Then Elijah said to the people, \"I, even I only, am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal\\'s prophets are four hundred fifty men. Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh. The God who answers by fire, let him be God.\" All the people answered, \"It is well said.\" Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.\" They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made. It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, \"Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.\" They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded. Elijah said to all the people, \"Come near to me\"; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down. Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying, \"Israel shall be your name.\" With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh. He made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, \"Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.\" He said, \"Do it a second time\"; and they did it the second time. He said, \"Do it a third time\"; and they did it the third time. The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water. It happened at the time of the offering of the offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, \"Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.\" Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, \"Yahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he is God!\" Elijah said to them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal! Don\\'t let one of them escape!\" They seized them. Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there. Elijah said to Ahab, \"Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.\" So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees. He said to his servant, \"Go up now, look toward the sea.\" He went up, and looked, and said, \"There is nothing.\" He said, \"Go again\" seven times. It happened at the seventh time, that he said, \"Behold, a small cloud, like a man\\'s hand, is rising out of the sea.\" He said, \"Go up, tell Ahab, \\'Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn\\'t stop you.\\'\" It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. The hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, \"So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don\\'t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!\" When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself went a day\\'s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, \"It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.\" He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, \"Arise and eat!\" He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel of Yahweh came again the second time, and touched him, and said, \"Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.\" He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God. He came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, and he said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" He said, \"I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\" He said, \"Go out, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.\" Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake a fire passed; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" He said, \"I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\" Yahweh said to him, \"Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. You shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place. It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.\" So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him. He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, \"Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.\" He said to him, \"Go back again; for what have I done to you?\" He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him. Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, \"Thus says Ben Hadad, \\'Your silver and your gold is mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.\\'\" The king of Israel answered, \"It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I have.\" The messengers came again, and said, \"Ben Hadad says, \\'I sent indeed to you, saying, \"You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children; but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.\"\\'\" Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, \"Please notice how this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn\\'t deny him.\" All the elders and all the people said to him, \"Don\\'t listen, neither consent.\" Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, \"Tell my lord the king, \\'All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do.\\'\" The messengers departed, and brought him back the message. Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, \"The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.\" The king of Israel answered, \"Tell him, \\'Don\\'t let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off.\\'\" It happened, when Ben Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, \"Prepare to attack!\" They prepared to attack the city. Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.\\'\" Ahab said, \"By whom?\" He said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'By the young men of the princes of the provinces.\\'\" Then he said, \"Who shall begin the battle?\" He answered, \"You.\" Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him. The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, \"Men are coming out from Samaria.\" He said, \"If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.\" So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter. The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, \"Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.\" The servants of the king of Syria said to him, \"Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place. Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than them.\" He listened to their voice, and did so. It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country. A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Because the Syrians have said, \"Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys\"; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.\\'\" They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day. But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room. His servants said to him, \"See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.\" So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, \"Your servant Ben Hadad says, \\'Please let me live.\\'\" He said, \"Is he still alive? He is my brother.\" Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, \"Your brother Ben Hadad.\" Then he said, \"Go, bring him.\" Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. Ben Hadad said to him, \"The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.\" \"I,\" said Ahab, \"will let you go with this covenant.\" So he made a covenant with him, and let him go. A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, \"Please strike me!\" The man refused to strike him. Then he said to him, \"Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you.\" As soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him. Then he found another man, and said, \"Please strike me.\" The man struck him, smiting and wounding him. So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, \"Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, \\'Guard this man! If by any means he be missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.\\' As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.\" The king of Israel said to him, \"So your judgment shall be; you yourself have decided it.\" He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets. He said to him, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.\\'\" The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria. It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, \"Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.\" Naboth said to Ahab, \"May Yahweh forbid me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!\" Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, \"I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.\" He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, \"Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?\" He said to her, \"Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, \\'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.\\' He answered, \\'I will not give you my vineyard.\\'\" Jezebel his wife said to him, \"Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\" So she wrote letters in Ahab\\'s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth. She wrote in the letters, saying, \"Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. Set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, \\'You cursed God and the king!\\' Then carry him out, and stone him to death.\" The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them. They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. The base fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, \"Naboth cursed God and the king!\" Then they carried him out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, \"Naboth has been stoned, and is dead.\" It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, \"Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\" It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, \"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. You shall speak to him, saying, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"Have you killed and also taken possession?\"\\' You shall speak to him, saying, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even yours.\"\\'\" Ahab said to Elijah, \"Have you found me, my enemy?\" He answered, \"I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh. Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.\" Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel, saying, \"The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel. The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field.\" But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel. It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, \"See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son\\'s days will I bring the evil on his house.\" They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. The king of Israel said to his servants, \"You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don\\'t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?\" He said to Jehoshaphat, \"Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?\" Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\" Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.\" Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, \"Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?\" They said, \"Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.\" But Jehoshaphat said, \"Isn\\'t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of him?\" The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.\" Jehoshaphat said, \"Don\\'t let the king say so.\" Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, \"Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.\" Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.\\'\" All the prophets prophesied so, saying, \"Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.\" The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, \"See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.\" Micaiah said, \"As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.\" When he had come to the king, the king said to him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?\" He answered him, \"Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.\" The king said to him, \"How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?\" He said, \"I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, \\'These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.\\'\" The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"Didn\\'t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?\" Micaiah said, \"Therefore hear the word of Yahweh. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. Yahweh said, \\'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?\\' One said one thing; and another said another. A spirit came out and stood before Yahweh, and said, \\'I will entice him.\\' Yahweh said to him, \\'How?\\' He said, \\'I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.\\' He said, \\'You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.\\' Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.\" Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, \"Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you?\" Micaiah said, \"Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.\" The king of Israel said, \"Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king\\'s son. Say, \\'Thus says the king, \"Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.\"\\'\" Micaiah said, \"If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.\" He said, \"Listen, all you people!\" So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.\" The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel. It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, \"Surely that is the king of Israel!\" and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out. It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, \"Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded.\" The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, \"Every man to his city, and every man to his country!\" So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke. Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother\\'s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn\\'t turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn\\'t go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber. Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \"Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.\" But Jehoshaphat would not. Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place. Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin. He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done. Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, \"Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.\" But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, \"Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, \\'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Now therefore thus says Yahweh, \"You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.\"\\'\" Elijah departed. The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, \"Why is it that you have returned?\" They said to him, \"A man came up to meet us, and said to us, \\'Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.\\'\"\\'\" He said to them, \"What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?\" They answered him, \"He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.\" He said, \"It is Elijah the Tishbite.\" Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, \"Man of God, the king has said, \\'Come down!\\'\" Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, \"If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!\" Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, \"Man of God, the king has said, \\'Come down quickly!\\'\" Elijah answered them, \"If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!\" The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, \"Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight. Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.\" The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, \"Go down with him. Don\\'t be afraid of him.\" He arose, and went down with him to the king. He said to him, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.\\'\" So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, \"Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.\" Elisha said, \"As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\" So they went down to Bethel. The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, \"Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?\" He said, \"Yes, I know it; hold your peace.\" Elijah said to him, \"Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.\" He said, \"As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\" So they came to Jericho. The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, \"Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?\" He answered, \"Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.\" Elijah said to him, \"Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.\" He said, \"As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\" They both went on. Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan. Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground. It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, \"Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.\" Elisha said, \"Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.\" He said, \"You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.\" It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha saw it, and he cried, \"My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!\" He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, \"Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?\" When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over. When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, \"The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.\" They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. They said to him, \"See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley. He said, \"You shall not send them.\" When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, \"Send them.\" They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn\\'t find him. They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, \"Didn\\'t I tell you, \\'Don\\'t go?\\'\" The men of the city said to Elisha, \"Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.\" He said, \"Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.\" They brought it to him. He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.\\'\" So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, \"Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldhead!\" He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths. He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made. Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn\\'t depart from it. Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams. But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, \"The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?\" He said, \"I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\" He said, \"Which way shall we go up?\" He answered, \"The way of the wilderness of Edom.\" So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days\\' journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them. The king of Israel said, \"Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\" But Jehoshaphat said, \"Isn\\'t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?\" One of the king of Israel\\'s servants answered, \"Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.\" Jehoshaphat said, \"The word of Yahweh is with him.\" So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. Elisha said to the king of Israel, \"What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.\" The king of Israel said to him, \"No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\" Elisha said, \"As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you. But now bring me a minstrel.\" It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came on him. He said, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Make this valley full of trenches.\\' For thus says Yahweh, \\'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals. This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.\\'\" It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border. They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood. They said, \"This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!\" When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites. They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it. When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, \"Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.\" Elisha said to her, \"What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?\" She said, \"Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.\" Then he said, \"Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Don\\'t borrow just a few. You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full.\" So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out. It happened, when the containers were full, that she said to her son, \"Bring me another container.\" He said to her, \"There isn\\'t another container.\" The oil stopped flowing. Then she came and told the man of God. He said, \"Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.\" It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. She said to her husband, \"See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually. Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.\" One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there. He said to Gehazi his servant, \"Call this Shunammite.\" When he had called her, she stood before him. He said to him, \"Say now to her, \\'Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?\\'\" She answered, \"I dwell among my own people.\" He said, \"What then is to be done for her?\" Gehazi answered, \"Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.\" He said, \"Call her.\" When he had called her, she stood in the door. He said, \"At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.\" She said, \"No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.\" The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her. When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers. He said to his father, \"My head! My head!\" He said to his servant, \"Carry him to his mother.\" When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died. She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out. She called to her husband, and said, \"Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.\" He said, \"Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.\" She said, \"It\\'s alright.\" Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, \"Drive, and go forward! Don\\'t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.\" So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, \"Behold, there is the Shunammite. Please run now to meet her, and ask her, \\'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?\\'\" She answered, \"It is well.\" When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, \"Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.\" Then she said, \"Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn\\'t I say, Do not deceive me?\" Then he said to Gehazi, \"Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don\\'t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don\\'t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child.\" The mother of the child said, \"As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\" He arose, and followed her. Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, \"The child has not awakened.\" When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed. He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh. He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm. Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. He called Gehazi, and said, \"Call this Shunammite!\" So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said, \"Take up your son.\" Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out. Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, \"Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\" One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn\\'t recognize them. So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, \"Man of God, there is death in the pot!\" They could not eat of it. But he said, \"Then bring meal.\" He cast it into the pot; and he said, \"Pour out for the people, that they may eat.\" There was no harm in the pot. A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, \"Give to the people, that they may eat.\" His servant said, \"What, should I set this before a hundred men?\" But he said, \"Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, \\'They will eat, and will have some left over.\\'\" So he set it before them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman\\'s wife. She said to her mistress, \"I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.\" Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, \"The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.\" The king of Syria said, \"Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\" He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing. He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, \"Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.\" It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, \"Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.\" It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, \"Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.\" So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, \"Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.\" But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, \"Behold, I thought, \\'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.\\' Aren\\'t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn\\'t I wash in them, and be clean?\" So he turned and went away in a rage. His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, \"My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn\\'t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, \\'Wash, and be clean?\\'\" Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, \"See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.\" But he said, \"As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.\" He urged him to take it; but he refused. Naaman said, \"If not, then, please let two mules\\' burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh. In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.\" He said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So he departed from him a little way. But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, \"Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.\" So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, \"Is all well?\" He said, \"All is well. My master has sent me, saying, \\'Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.\\'\" Naaman said, \"Be pleased to take two talents.\" He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him. When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed. But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, \"Where did you come from, Gehazi?\" He said, \"Your servant went nowhere.\" He said to him, \"Didn\\'t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants? Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever.\" He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow. The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, \"See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us. Please let us go to the Jordan, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.\" He answered, \"Go!\" One said, \"Please be pleased to go with your servants.\" He answered, \"I will go.\" So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood. But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, \"Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.\" The man of God asked, \"Where did it fall?\" He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float. He said, \"Take it.\" So he put out his hand and took it. Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, \"My camp will be in such and such a place.\" The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, \"Beware that you not pass such a place; for the Syrians are coming down there.\" The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice. The heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, \"Won\\'t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?\" One of his servants said, \"No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\" He said, \"Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.\" It was told him, saying, \"Behold, he is in Dothan.\" Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city. When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, \"Alas, my master! What shall we do?\" He answered, \"Don\\'t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\" Elisha prayed, and said, \"Yahweh, please open his eyes, that he may see.\" Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha. When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, \"Please strike this people with blindness.\" He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. Elisha said to them, \"This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.\" He led them to Samaria. It happened, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, \"Yahweh, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.\" Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, \"My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?\" He answered, \"You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.\" He prepared great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel. It happened after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria. There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey\\'s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove\\'s dung for five pieces of silver. As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, \"Help, my lord, O king!\" He said, \"If Yahweh doesn\\'t help you, from where could I help you? From of the threshing floor, or from the winepress?\" The king said to her, \"What ails you?\" She answered, \"This woman said to me, \\'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.\\' So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, \\'Give your son, that we may eat him;\\' and she has hidden her son.\" It happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh. Then he said, \"God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day.\" But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, \"Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn\\'t the sound of his master\\'s feet behind him?\" While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, \"Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?\" Elisha said, \"Hear the word of Yahweh. Thus says Yahweh, \\'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.\\'\" Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, \"Behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?\" He said, \"Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.\" Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, \"Why do we sit here until we die? If we say, \\'We will enter into the city,\\' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.\" They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there. For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us. Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it. Then they said one to another, \"We aren\\'t doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king\\'s household.\" So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, \"We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.\" He called the porters; and they told it to the king\\'s household within. The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, \"I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, \\'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.\\'\" One of his servants answered, \"Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see.\" They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, \"Go and see.\" They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king. The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh. The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, \"Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria\"; and that captain answered the man of God, and said, \"Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?\" and he said, \"Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.\" It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died. Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, \"Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh has called for a famine. It shall also come on the land seven years.\" The woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years. It happened at the seven years\\' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land. Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, \"Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.\" It happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, \"My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.\" When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, \"Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.\" Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. It was told him, saying, \"The man of God has come here.\" The king said to Hazael, \"Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, \\'Will I recover from this sickness?\\'\" So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels\\' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, \"Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, \\'Will I recover from this sickness?\\'\" Elisha said to him, \"Go, tell him, \\'You shall surely recover;\\' however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die.\" He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept. Hazael said, \"Why do you weep, my lord?\" He answered, \"Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.\" Hazael said, \"But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?\" Elisha answered, \"Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.\" Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, \"What did Elisha say to you?\" He answered, \"He told me that you would surely recover.\" It happened on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place. In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem. He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his servant\\'s sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents. So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother\\'s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. He walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, \"Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead. When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room. Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"I have anointed you king over Israel.\"\\' Then open the door, flee, and don\\'t wait.\" So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, \"I have a message for you, captain.\" Jehu said, \"To which of us all?\" He said, \"To you, O captain.\" He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, \"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, \\'I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel. You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel. For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel. The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.\\'\" He opened the door, and fled. Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, \"Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?\" He said to them, \"You know the man and what his talk was.\" They said, \"That is a lie. Tell us now.\" He said, \"He said to me, \\'Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel.\\'\" Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, \"Jehu is king.\" So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria; but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, \"If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.\" So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram. Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, \"I see a company.\" Joram said, \"Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, \\'Is it peace?\\'\" So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, \"Thus says the king, \\'Is it peace?\\'\" Jehu said, \"What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!\" The watchman said, \"The messenger came to them, but he isn\\'t coming back.\" Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, \"Thus says the king, \\'Is it peace?\\'\" Jehu answered, \"What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!\" The watchman said, \"He came to them, and isn\\'t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.\" Joram said, \"Get ready!\" They got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, \"Is it peace, Jehu?\" He answered, \"What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?\" Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, \"There is treason, Ahaziah!\" Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, \"Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him: \\'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,\\' says Yahweh; \\'and I will repay you in this plot of ground,\\' says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to the word of Yahweh.\" But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, \"Strike him also in the chariot!\" They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there. His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David. In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window. As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, \"Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?\" He lifted up his face to the window, and said, \"Who is on my side? Who?\" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him. He said, \"Throw her down!\" So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot. When he had come in, he ate and drink; and he said, \"See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king\\'s daughter.\" They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. Therefore they came back, and told him. He said, \"This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, \\'The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel, and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, \"This is Jezebel.\"\\'\" Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab, saying, But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, \"Behold, the two kings didn\\'t stand before him! How then shall we stand?\" He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, \"We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.\" Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, \"If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master\\'s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.\" Now the king\\'s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up. It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took the king\\'s sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel. A messenger came, and told him, \"They have brought the heads of the king\\'s sons.\" He said, \"Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.\" It happened in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, \"You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these? Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.\" So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way, Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, \"Who are you?\" They answered, \"We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.\" He said, \"Take them alive!\" They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn\\'t leave any of them. When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, \"Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?\" Jehonadab answered, \"It is.\" \"If it is, give me your hand.\" He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. He said, \"Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.\" So they made him ride in his chariot. When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah. Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, \"Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshippers, and all of his priests. Let none be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.\" But Jehu did it in subtlety, intending that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. Jehu said, \"Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!\" They proclaimed it. Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn\\'t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another. He said to him who was over the vestry, \"Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal!\" He brought robes out to them. Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshippers of Baal, \"Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of Yahweh, but the worshippers of Baal only.\" They went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him eighty men outside, and said, \"If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.\" It happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, \"Go in, and kill them! Let none escape.\" They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them. They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day. Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu didn\\'t depart from after them, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan. Yahweh said to Jehu, \"Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\" But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn\\'t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin. In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel; from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place. The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years. Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king\\'s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain; He was with her hidden in the house of Yahweh six years. Athaliah reigned over the land. In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh, and showed them the king\\'s son. He commanded them, saying, \"This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king\\'s house; A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier. The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh around the king. You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.\" The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David\\'s, which were in the house of Yahweh. The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king. Then he brought out the king\\'s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, \"Long live the king!\" When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Yahweh: and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, \"Treason! Treason!\" Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, \"Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with the sword.\" For the priest said, \"Don\\'t let her be slain in the house of Yahweh.\" So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses\\' entry to the king\\'s house. She was slain there. Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh\\'s people; between the king also and the people. All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh. He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Yahweh, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king\\'s house. He sat on the throne of the kings. So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king\\'s house. Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him. However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, \"Why don\\'t you repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.\" The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house. But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh. It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king\\'s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh. They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of Yahweh, and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. Moreover they didn\\'t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully. The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of Yahweh: it was the priests\\'. Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the king\\'s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem. Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla. For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his place. In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn\\'t depart from it. The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually. Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them. (Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before. Nevertheless they didn\\'t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.) For he didn\\'t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his place. In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he didn\\'t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein. Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, \"My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!\" Elisha said to him, \"Take bow and arrows\"; and he took to him bow and arrows. He said to the king of Israel, \"Put your hand on the bow\"; and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king\\'s hands. He said, \"Open the window eastward\"; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, \"Shoot!\" and he shot. He said, \"Yahweh\\'s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.\" He said, \"Take the arrows\"; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, \"Strike the ground\"; and he struck three times, and stopped. The man of God was angry with him, and said, \"You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times.\" Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. It happened, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place. Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel. In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign. He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done. However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. It happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father: but the children of the murderers he didn\\'t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, \"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.\" He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day. Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, \"Come, let us look one another in the face.\" Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, \"The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, \\'Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle. You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?\\'\" But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. Judah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent. Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king\\'s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place. Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there. They brought him on horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty-one years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he didn\\'t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath Hepher. For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel. Yahweh didn\\'t say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his place. In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham the king\\'s son was over the household, judging the people of the land. Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his place. In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as his fathers had done: he didn\\'t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his place. Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. This was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu, saying, \"Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\" So it came to pass. Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned for a month in Samaria. Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him, and reigned in his place. Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all who were therein, and its borders, from Tirzah: because they didn\\'t open to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women therein who were with child he ripped up. In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he didn\\'t depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and didn\\'t stay there in the land. Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place. In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he didn\\'t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the king\\'s house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his place. Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he didn\\'t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel Beth Maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him, and killed him, and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? In those days Yahweh began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his place. In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he didn\\'t do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, like David his father. But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel. He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day. So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, \"I am your servant and your son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.\" Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king\\'s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin. King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and its pattern, according to all its workmanship. Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus. When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered on it. He burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar. The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his altar. King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, \"On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king\\'s burnt offering, and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.\" Urijah the priest did so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone. The covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king\\'s entry outside, turned he to the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place. In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him. Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute. The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made. The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city; and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree; and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger; and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, \"You shall not do this thing.\" Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, \"Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.\" Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn\\'t believe in Yahweh their God. They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them. They forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal. They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. Also Judah didn\\'t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin. The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn\\'t depart from them; until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day. The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it. So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn\\'t fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them. Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, \"The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don\\'t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don\\'t know the law of the god of the land.\" Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, \"Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.\" So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh. However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived. The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away. To this day they do what they did before: they don\\'t fear Yahweh, neither do they follow their statutes, or their ordinances, or the law or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, \"You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them; but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall sacrifice to him. The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forevermore. You shall not fear other gods. You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you; neither shall you fear other gods. But you shall fear Yahweh your God; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.\" However they did not listen, but they did what they did before. So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their children\\'s children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day. Now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done. He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan. He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him. For he joined with Yahweh; he didn\\'t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses. Yahweh was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn\\'t serve him. He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. It happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. At the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, because they didn\\'t obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it. Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, \"I have offended; return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.\" The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king\\'s house. At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh\\'s temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller\\'s field. When they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. Rabshakeh said to them, \"Say now to Hezekiah, \\'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, \"What confidence is this in which you trust? You say (but they are but vain words), \\'There is counsel and strength for war.\\' Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him. But if you tell me, \\'We trust in Yahweh our God;\\' isn\\'t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, \\'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?\\' Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master\\'s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, \\'Go up against this land, and destroy it.\\'\"\\'\" Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, \"Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it. Don\\'t speak with us in the Jews\\' language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.\" But Rabshakeh said to them, \"Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn\\'t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?\" Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews\\' language, and spoke, saying, \"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. Thus says the king, \\'Don\\'t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand. Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, \"Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" Don\\'t listen to Hezekiah.\\' For thus says the king of Assyria, \\'Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern; until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Don\\'t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, \"Yahweh will deliver us.\" Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?\\'\" But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king\\'s commandment was, \"Don\\'t answer him.\" Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh. He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. They said to him, \"Thus says Hezekiah, \\'This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them. It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.\\'\" So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. Isaiah said to them, \"Thus you shall tell your master, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"Don\\'t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.\"\\'\" So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, \"Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying, \\'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, \"Don\\'t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?\"\\'\" Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh. Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, \"Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent to defy the living God. Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men\\'s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.\" Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, \"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, \\'Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you. This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: \"The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you. Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, \\'With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field. I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.\\' Haven\\'t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up. But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me. Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.\" \"\\'This shall be the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit. The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Yahweh will perform this.\\' \"Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, \\'He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city,\\' says Yahweh. \\'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David\\'s sake.\\'\" It happened that night, that the angel of Yahweh went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh. It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place. In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.\\'\" Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying, \"Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.\" Hezekiah wept bitterly. It happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, \"Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, \\'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, \"I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you shall go up to the house of Yahweh. I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David\\'s sake.\"\\'\" Isaiah said, \"Take a cake of figs.\" They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \"What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day?\" Isaiah said, \"This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?\" Hezekiah answered, \"It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.\" Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz. At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn\\'t show them. Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, \"What did these men say? From where did they come to you?\" Hezekiah said, \"They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.\" He said, \"What have they seen in your house?\" Hezekiah answered, \"They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.\" Isaiah said to Hezekiah, \"Hear the word of Yahweh. \\'Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,\\' says Yahweh. \\'Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.\\'\" Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \"The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good.\" He said moreover, \"Isn\\'t it so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?\" Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his place. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Hephzibah. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel. For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them. He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, \"I will put my name in Jerusalem.\" He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh. He made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. He set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, \"In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever; neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.\" But they didn\\'t listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel. Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying, \"Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols; therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, \\'Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle. I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies. They will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.\\'\" Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his place. Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as Manasseh his father did. He walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them: and he forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn\\'t walk in the way of Yahweh. The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house. But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his place. Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn\\'t turn aside to the right hand or to the left. It happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying, \"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people. Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches of the house, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house. However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.\" Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, \"I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh.\" Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it. Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, \"Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.\" Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, \"Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.\" Shaphan read it before the king. It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes. The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king\\'s servant, saying, \"Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.\" So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her. She said to them, \"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: \\'Tell the man who sent you to me, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.\\'\" \\'Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place.\\'\"\\'\" They brought back this message to the king. The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh. The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant. The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of Yahweh\\'s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel. He put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky. He brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people. He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah. He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man\\'s left hand at the gate of the city. Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn\\'t come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers. He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron. The the king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon. He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men. Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah. As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things. Then he said, \"What monument is that which I see?\" The men of the city told him, \"It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.\" He said, \"Let him be! Let no man move his bones.\" So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria. All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men\\'s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem. The king commanded all the people, saying, \"Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.\" Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem. Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Yahweh. Like him was there no king before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn\\'t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him. Yahweh said, \"I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, \\'My name shall be there.\\'\" Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father\\'s place. Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done. Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there. Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh. Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done. In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servants the prophets. Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did, and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not pardon. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren\\'t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. The king of Egypt didn\\'t come again out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt. Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother\\'s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his father had done. At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it; and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. He carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king\\'s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh\\'s temple, as Yahweh had said. He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land. He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king\\'s mother, and the king\\'s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin\\'s father\\'s brother, king is his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother\\'s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. For through the anger of Yahweh, it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it. So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king\\'s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him. They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon. Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem. He burnt the house of Yahweh, and the king\\'s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire. All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem. Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields. The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, and carried the brass pieces to Babylon. They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered. The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver. The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold: and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king\\'s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city. As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor. Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, \"Don\\'t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.\" But it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah. All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life: and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life. Adam, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

These are the chiefs of Edom. These are the sons of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. The sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah; which three were born to him of Shua\\'s daughter the Canaanitess. Er, Judah\\'s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh; and he killed him. Tamar his daughter-in-law bore him Perez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. The sons of Perez: Hezron, and Hamul.

Azubah died, and Caleb took to him Ephrath, who bore him Hur. Hur became the father of Uri, and Uri became the father of Bezalel. Afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead, whom he took as wife when he was sixty years old; and she bore him Segub. Segub became the father of Jair, who had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead. Geshur and Aram took the towns of Jair from them, with Kenath, and its villages, even sixty cities. All these were the sons of Machir the father of Gilead. After that Hezron was dead in Caleb Ephrathah, then Abijah Hezron\\'s wife bore him Ashhur the father of Tekoa. The sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, Ahijah. Jerahmeel had another wife, whose name was Atarah; she was the mother of Onam.

So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience. Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim. In Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah. Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel, and their brothers, six hundred ninety.

Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father\\'s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent: and their fathers had been over the camp of Yahweh, keepers of the entry. Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and Yahweh was with him. Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting. All these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust. So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the tent, by wards. On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them: for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God\\'s house. They lodged around God\\'s house, because that duty was on them; and to them pertained its opening morning by morning. Certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out. Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. Some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices. Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans. Some of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath. These are the singers, heads of fathers\\' households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free from other service; for they were employed in their work day and night.

Azel had six sons, whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel. Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers. Then Saul said to his armor bearer, \"Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.\" But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it. When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died. So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together. When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. They stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people. They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of the word of Yahweh, which he didn\\'t keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire, and didn\\'t inquire of Yahweh: therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, \"Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, \\'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.\\'\" So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel. David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, \"You shall not come in here.\" Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is the city of David. David said, \"Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.\" Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David. He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him. Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time. After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. They stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory. Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. David longed, and said, \"Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!\" The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh, and said, \"My God forbid it me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?\" For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn\\'t attain to the three. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian\\'s hand was a spear like a weaver\\'s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian\\'s hand, and killed him with his own spear. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men. Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn\\'t attain to the three: and David set him over his guard. Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul\\'s brothers of Benjamin. The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite, and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite, Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites, and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. Of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on the mountains; Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand. These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west. There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David. David went out to meet them, and answered them, \"If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.\" Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, \"We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.\" Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn\\'t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, \"He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.\" As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. They helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army. For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God. These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Yahweh. The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war. Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred, and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father\\'s house twenty-two captains. Of the children of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers\\' houses. Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment. Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could command and were not of double heart. Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand. Of the Danites who could set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred. Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand. On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand. All these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for them. Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel. David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. David said to all the assembly of Israel, \"If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us; and let us bring again the ark of our God to us. For we didn\\'t seek it in the days of Saul.\" All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name. They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God. David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, to this day. David was afraid of God that day, saying, \"How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?\" So David didn\\'t move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had. Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel\\'s sake. David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters. These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. David inquired of God, saying, \"Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?\" Yahweh said to him, \"Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.\" So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim. They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. David inquired again of God; and God said to him, \"You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees. It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.\" David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations. David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. Then David said, \"No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.\" David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it. David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites: of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty; of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty; of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty; of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty; of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve. David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, and said to them, \"You are the heads of the fathers\\' households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. For because you didn\\'t carry it at first, Yahweh our God made broke out against us, because we didn\\'t seek him according to the ordinance.\" So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh. David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud; and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful. Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy. It happened, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David had on him an ephod of linen. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. It happened, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh. He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel: Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God. Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers. Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on his name. Make his doings known among the peoples. Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of all his marvelous works. Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more. Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, you seed of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is Yahweh our God. His judgments are in all the earth. Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac. He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying, \"I will give you the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance,\" when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners were in it. They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, \"Don\\'t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!\" Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Display his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the nations, and his marvelous works among all the peoples. For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens. Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place. Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength! Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established that it can\\'t be moved. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, \"Yahweh reigns!\" Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is therein! Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth. Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. Say, \"Save us, God of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise.\" Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, \"Amen,\" and praised Yahweh. So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day\\'s work required; and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon, to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel; and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness endures forever; and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. All the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, \"Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains.\" Nathan said to David, \"Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.\" It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, \"Go and tell David my servant, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"You shall not build me a house to dwell in; \"Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, \\'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, \"I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house. It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you; but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever.\"\\'\" According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, \"Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant\\'s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God. What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant. Yahweh, for your servant\\'s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things. Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt? For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God. Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, \\'Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.\\' For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant. Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.\" After this it happened, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. He struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots. When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou;) and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass. King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand. He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people. Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. It happened after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place. David said, \"I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.\" So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David\\'s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, \"Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven\\'t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?\" So Hanun took David\\'s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, \"Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.\" When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah. So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men. The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. He said, \"If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.\" So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head. It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army. It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it. David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David\\'s head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut them with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued. There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver\\'s beam. There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant. When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David\\'s brother killed him. These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, \"Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.\" Joab said, \"May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren\\'t they all my lord\\'s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?\" Nevertheless the king\\'s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword. But he didn\\'t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king\\'s word was abominable to Joab. God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel. David said to God, \"I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.\" Yahweh spoke to Gad, David\\'s seer, saying, \"Go and speak to David, saying, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.\"\\'\" So Gad came to David, and said to him, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'Take your choice: either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.\\'\" David said to Gad, \"I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.\" So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, \"It is enough; now stay your hand.\" The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. David said to God, \"Isn\\'t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father\\'s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.\" Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh. Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. Then David said to Ornan, \"Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.\" Ornan said to David, \"Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.\" King David said to Ornan, \"No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.\" So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering. Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath. At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. But David couldn\\'t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh. Then David said, \"This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.\" David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God\\'s house. David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight; and cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David. David said, \"Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.\" So David prepared abundantly before his death. Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel. David said to Solomon his son, \"As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God. But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, \\'You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.\\' Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you. May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God. Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Don\\'t be afraid, neither be dismayed. Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them. There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work: of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.\" David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, \"Isn\\'t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn\\'t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people. Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh.\" Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. David said, \"Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; six thousand were officers and judges; four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for giving praise.\" David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers\\' households of Ladan. The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn\\'t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers\\' house in one reckoning. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever. But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. These were the sons of Levi after their fathers\\' houses, even the heads of the fathers\\' houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward. For David said, \"Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.\" For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward. For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God\\'s house; for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all kinds of measure and size; and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening; and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh; and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Yahweh. These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest\\'s office. David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers\\' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers\\' houses, eight. Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers\\' households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers\\' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. This was their ordering in their service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him. Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno. The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers\\' houses. These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers\\' households of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers\\' households of the chief even as those of his younger brother. Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did the work according to their service was: of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king. Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh. Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth. All these were the sons of Heman the king\\'s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of God\\'s house; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king. The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. They cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar. Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and sons were twelve: the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the tenth to Shimei, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and his brothers, twelve: the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the one and twentieth to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the two and twentieth to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve: for the four and twentieth to Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve. For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth, Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor. The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah. All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom. Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, valiant men, eighteen. Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief), Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in the house of Yahweh. They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers\\' houses, for every gate. The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse. To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against watch. Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two. For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar. These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari. Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of God\\'s house, and over the treasures of the dedicated things. The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers\\' households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh. Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites: and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures. His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers\\' households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. They dedicated some of the spoil won in battles to repair the house of Yahweh. All that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the king. Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers\\' households. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead. His brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers\\' households, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king. Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers\\' households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year--of every division were twenty-four thousand. Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. He was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month. Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his division; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of his division was Ammizabad his son. The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The fifth captain for this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division were Twenty-four thousand. The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah: of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok: of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael: of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel: of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner: of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. But David didn\\'t take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but didn\\'t finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David. Over the king\\'s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah: Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the winecellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David\\'s. Also Jonathan, David\\'s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king\\'s sons: Ahithophel was the king\\'s counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king\\'s friend: and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king\\'s army was Joab. David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies who served the king by division, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem. Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, \"Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building. But God said to me, \\'You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.\\' However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh\\'s kingdom over Israel. He said to me, \\'Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.\\' Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever. You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.\" Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner rooms of it, and of the place of the mercy seat; and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of God\\'s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things; also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh; of gold by weight for the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver, by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lampstand; and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, the cherubim, that spread out, and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. \"All this,\" said David, \"I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.\" David said to Solomon his son, \"Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don\\'t be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh is finished. Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of God\\'s house. There shall be with you in all kinds of work every willing man who has skill, for any kind of service. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.\" David the king said to all the assembly, \"Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God. Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the  gold for the things of gold,  and the silver for the things of silver,  and the brass for the things of brass,  the iron for the things of iron,  and wood for the things of wood;  onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses; of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?\" Then the princes of the fathers\\' households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king\\'s work, offered willingly; and they gave for the service of God\\'s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. They with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, \"You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all. Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own. I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you. Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you; and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.\" David said to all the assembly, \"Now bless Yahweh your God!\" All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king. They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel, and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place. Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers\\' households. So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness. But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there. Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, \"Ask what I shall give you.\" Solomon said to God, \"You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?\" God said to Solomon, \"Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king: wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you have the like.\" So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king\\'s merchants purchased them from Kue. They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means. Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom. Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, \"As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me. Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel. \"The house which I build is great; for our God is great above all gods. But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can\\'t contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him? \"Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. \"Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall be with your servants, even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful. Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.\" Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, \"Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.\" Huram continued, \"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom. Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father\\'s, the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan;  and his father was a man of Tyre,  skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber,  in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson,  also to engrave any kind of engraving, and to devise any device;  that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father. \"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants: and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.\" Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred. He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work. Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God\\'s house. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. The porch that was in front, its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim. He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls. He made the most holy house: its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold. In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold. The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub. The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house. He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim. Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. He made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height. Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it. Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths. He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. He made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold. Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with brass. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God\\'s house: the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases; one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass. The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. Solomon made all the vessels that were in God\\'s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them; and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold; and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold. Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers\\' households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion. And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark; and they brought up the ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the priests the Levites brought up. King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude. The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day. There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. It happened, when the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn\\'t keep their divisions; also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;) it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying, \"For he is good; for his loving kindness endures forever!\" that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled God\\'s house. Then Solomon said, \"Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.\" The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood. He said, \"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying, \\'Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel: but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.\\' Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. But Yahweh said to David my father, \\'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart: nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.\\' \"Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of Israel.\" He stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands (for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;) and he said, \"Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart; who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day. \"Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, \\'There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.\\' Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David. \"But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can\\'t contain you; how much less this house which I have built! Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you; that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place. Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive. \"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house; then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. \"If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house; then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers. \"When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them: then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance. \"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is; whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house: then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men;) that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers. \"Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for your great name\\'s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house: then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name. \"If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name; then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. \"If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn\\'t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near; yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, \\'We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;\\' if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name: then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you. \"Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place. \"Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness. \"Yahweh God, don\\'t turn away the face of your anointed. Remember your loving kindnesses to David your servant.\" Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house. The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh\\'s house. All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying, \"For he is good; for his loving kindness endures for ever.\" Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh. King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God\\'s house. The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised by their ministry, saying \"For his loving kindness endures for ever.\" The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood. Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat. So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king\\'s house: and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon\\'s heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house. Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, \"I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. \"If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place. For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. \"As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances; then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, \\'There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.\\' But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, \\'Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?\\' They shall answer, \\'Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshiped them, and served them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.\\'\" It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his own house, that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it. He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath. Also he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars; and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people. Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, \"My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come are holy.\" Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built before the porch, even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents. He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. They didn\\'t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it was finished. So the house of Yahweh was completed. Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom. Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart. Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hidden from Solomon which he didn\\'t tell her. When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her. She said to the king, \"It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom. However I didn\\'t believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard. Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom. Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.\" The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. The king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the king\\'s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah. King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler. He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays. Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom. All king Solomon\\'s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren\\'t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, \"Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.\" He said to them, \"Come again to me after three days.\" The people departed. King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, \"What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?\" They spoke to him, saying, \"If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.\" But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. He said to them, \"What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, \\'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?\\'\" The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, \"Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, \\'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;\\' thus you shall say to them, \\'My little finger is thicker than my father\\'s waist. Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\\'\" So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, \"Come to me again the third day.\" The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, \"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\" So the king didn\\'t listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. When all Israel saw that the king didn\\'t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, \"What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.\" So all Israel departed to their tents. But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day. When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, \"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, \\'Thus says Yahweh, \"You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Return every man to his house; for this thing is of me.\"\\'\" So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam. Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam, and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities. He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine. He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him. The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border. For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest\\'s office to Yahweh; and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made. After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon. Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.) Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king. He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought for them many wives. It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him. It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh, with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, \"Thus says Yahweh, \\'You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.\\'\" Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, \"Yahweh is righteous.\" When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, \"They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.\" So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king\\'s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.'"
